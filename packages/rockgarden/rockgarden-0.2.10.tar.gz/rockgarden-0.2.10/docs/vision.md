# Vision

A Python-based SSG that works with Obsidian vaults directly, without requiring users to change how they organize or manage content. The simple case takes an Obsidian vault and produces a navigable static site. Advanced usage allows defining content models mapped to paths.

**Key insight:** An intermediate data store with API enables future use cases (MCP server, different output formats, etc.)
