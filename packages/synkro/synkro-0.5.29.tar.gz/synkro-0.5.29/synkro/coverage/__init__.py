across policy sub-categories, similar to code coverage for tests.

Components:
- TaxonomyExtractor: Extract sub-category taxonomy from policy
- ScenarioTagger: Tag scenarios with sub-category IDs
- CoverageCalculator: Calculate coverage metrics
- CoverageImprover: Generate scenarios to fill coverage gaps
