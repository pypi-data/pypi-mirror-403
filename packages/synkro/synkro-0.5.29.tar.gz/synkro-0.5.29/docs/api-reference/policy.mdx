The `Policy` class represents a policy document used for dataset generation.

## Import

```python
from synkro import Policy
```

---

## Creating a Policy

### From String

```python
policy = Policy(text="""
All refund requests must be processed within 30 days.
Refunds over $100 require manager approval.
""")

dataset = synkro.generate(policy, traces=100)
```

### From File

```python
policy = Policy.from_file("customer_service_policy.md")

# Supports various formats
policy = Policy.from_file("policy.txt")
policy = Policy.from_file("policy.md")
policy = Policy.from_file("policy.json")
```

### Direct String (Shorthand)

```python
# synkro.generate() accepts string directly
dataset = synkro.generate("Your policy text...", traces=100)
```

---

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `text` | `str` | The policy text content |

---

## Methods

### from_file()

Load policy from a file.

```python
Policy.from_file(path: str | Path) -> Policy
```

<ParamField path="path" type="str | Path" required>
  Path to the policy file
</ParamField>

```python
policy = Policy.from_file("policies/customer_service.md")
```

---

## Built-in Policies

Synkro includes example policies for testing and development:

```python
from synkro.policies import (
    customer_support,
    expense_approval,
    content_moderation,
)

# Use directly
dataset = synkro.generate(customer_support, traces=100)

# Access text
print(customer_support.text)
```

### customer_support

Customer service guidelines including:
- Response tone and professionalism
- Refund and return policies
- Escalation procedures
- Privacy handling

### expense_approval

Expense reimbursement rules including:
- Approval thresholds
- Receipt requirements
- Category restrictions
- Documentation rules

### content_moderation

Content policy rules including:
- Prohibited content types
- Age restrictions
- Copyright handling
- Community guidelines

---

## Custom Policy Tips

### Structure

Organize policies with clear sections:

```markdown
# Customer Service Policy

## Refunds
- All refund requests must be processed within 30 days
- Refunds over $100 require manager approval
- Final sale items cannot be refunded

## Returns
- Items must be in original condition
- Include original packaging when possible
- Return shipping is customer responsibility

## Exceptions
- VIP customers get extended return windows
- Damaged items are always eligible for refund
```

### Best Practices

1. **Be explicit**: State rules clearly, avoid ambiguity
2. **Include examples**: "For example, if a customer requests..."
3. **Define exceptions**: Clearly state when rules don't apply
4. **Use consistent terminology**: Pick terms and use them throughout
5. **Organize by topic**: Group related rules together

## Usage Examples

### Basic Generation

```python
from synkro import Policy

policy = Policy(text="""
All customer inquiries must be responded to within 24 hours.
Sensitive information (SSN, credit cards) must never be requested via chat.
Escalate any complaints about service quality to a supervisor.
""")

dataset = synkro.generate(policy, traces=50)
```

### Combining Policies

```python
from synkro import Policy
from synkro.policies import customer_support

# Extend built-in policy
custom_policy = Policy(text=f"""
{customer_support.text}

## Additional Rules
- VIP customers get priority handling
- All security concerns are escalated immediately
- Offer 10% discount for service failures
""")

dataset = synkro.generate(custom_policy, traces=100)
```

### Multi-File Policy

```python
from pathlib import Path

# Load and combine multiple policy files
policy_dir = Path("policies")
combined_text = "\n\n".join(
    (policy_dir / f).read_text()
    for f in ["general.md", "refunds.md", "security.md"]
)

policy = Policy(text=combined_text)
dataset = synkro.generate(policy, traces=200)
```
