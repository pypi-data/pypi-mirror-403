A comprehensive AI-powered safety ecosystem built with Kiro CLI that provides proactive monitoring, emergency response, and automated assistance for women's travel safety.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start for Judges

**Our MCP servers are published on PyPI - no local setup needed!**

### 1. Install UV (one command)
```powershell
# Windows
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Mac/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Add to Kiro MCP config (`~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`)
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sakhi-weather": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "hackathon-sakhi", "sakhi-weather"],
      "env": { "OPENWEATHER_API_KEY": "47875d49ee60cdf958dc3732baf14507" }
    },
    "sakhi-news": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "hackathon-sakhi", "sakhi-news"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Test in Kiro
```bash
kiro-cli chat
> What's the weather in Delhi?
> Show me women safety news for Mumbai
```
