TASK: Search for text in files
DOMAIN: coding

STEPS:
1. Open the Start menu to access applications
   REASONING: Need to launch Visual Studio Code which is the primary tool for searching text in files efficiently
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Start menu to appear
   REASONING: Allow the system time to render the Start menu before interacting with it
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Type "Visual Studio Code" to search for the application
   REASONING: Quickly locate Visual Studio Code instead of manually browsing through the application list
   ACTION: TYPE("Visual Studio Code")

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: Give the system time to filter and display matching applications
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

5. Click on Visual Studio Code from the search results
   REASONING: Launch the application to access its file search capabilities
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.35)

6. Wait for Visual Studio Code to fully load
   REASONING: Ensure the application interface is completely rendered before attempting to interact with it
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

7. Open a folder to search within
   REASONING: Need to specify the directory scope where the text search will be performed
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "k", "ctrl", "o")

8. Wait for folder selection dialog to appear
   REASONING: Allow the file explorer dialog to open before selecting a folder
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

9. Navigate to and select the target folder (e.g., Documents)
   REASONING: Choose the directory containing the files to be searched
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.3, y=0.4)

10. Confirm folder selection
    REASONING: Load the selected folder into VS Code's workspace for searching
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.7, y=0.85)

11. Wait for folder to load in workspace
    REASONING: Allow VS Code to index and display the folder structure
    ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

12. Open the Search panel using keyboard shortcut
    REASONING: Access the search-in-files functionality which allows searching across multiple files simultaneously
    ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "shift", "f")

13. Wait for Search panel to appear
    REASONING: Ensure the search interface is ready for input
    ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

14. Type the search term in the search box
    REASONING: Specify the text pattern to find across all files in the workspace
    ACTION: TYPE("function calculateTotal")

15. Press Enter to execute the search
    REASONING: Initiate the search operation to find all occurrences of the specified text
    ACTION: HOTKEY("Return")

16. Wait for search results to populate
    REASONING: Allow VS Code to scan through files and compile matching results
    ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

17. Review the search results displayed in the panel
    REASONING: Verify that the search has been executed and results are visible, showing file names, line numbers, and context
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.35)

18. Mark task as complete
    REASONING: The text search across files has been successfully performed and results are displayed
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Visual Studio Code is open with a folder loaded, and the Search panel displays all occurrences of the searched text "function calculateTotal" across multiple files, showing file names, line numbers, and code context for each match. The user can now navigate through results and view each occurrence in detail.
