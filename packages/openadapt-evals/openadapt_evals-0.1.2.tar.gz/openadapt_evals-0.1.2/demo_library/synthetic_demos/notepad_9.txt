TASK: Cut/copy/paste text
DOMAIN: notepad

STEPS:
1. Open Notepad application
   REASONING: We need to launch Notepad to have a text editor where we can demonstrate cut/copy/paste operations
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Start menu to appear
   REASONING: Allow time for the Start menu to fully render before proceeding
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Type "notepad" to search for the application
   REASONING: Searching for Notepad is the quickest way to locate and launch the application
   ACTION: TYPE("notepad")

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: Give the system time to display search results
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Click on Notepad from search results
   REASONING: Launch the Notepad application from the search results
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.25)

6. Wait for Notepad to open
   REASONING: Allow time for the Notepad window to fully load and become ready for input
   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

7. Type initial text content
   REASONING: Create sample text that we can use to demonstrate cut, copy, and paste operations
   ACTION: TYPE("This is the first line of text.\nThis is the second line of text.\nThis is the third line of text.")

8. Select the second line of text by triple-clicking
   REASONING: We need to select text before we can perform cut/copy operations; triple-clicking selects an entire line
   ACTION: DRAG(start_x=0.1, start_y=0.42, end_x=0.48, end_y=0.42)

9. Copy the selected text
   REASONING: Copy the selected text to clipboard so we can paste it later without removing the original
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "c")

10. Click at the end of the document
    REASONING: Position the cursor where we want to paste the copied text
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.48, y=0.50)

11. Paste the copied text
    REASONING: Insert the clipboard content at the cursor position to demonstrate paste functionality
    ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "v")

12. Select the first line of text
    REASONING: Now we'll demonstrate the cut operation by selecting different text
    ACTION: DRAG(start_x=0.1, start_y=0.38, end_x=0.48, end_y=0.38)

13. Cut the selected text
    REASONING: Remove the selected text and place it on the clipboard using the cut operation
    ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "x")

14. Click at the beginning of the document
    REASONING: Position cursor at the start to paste the cut text in a new location
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.1, y=0.38)

15. Paste the cut text
    REASONING: Insert the cut text at the new position, demonstrating that cut removes text from original location and allows repositioning
    ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "v")

16. Task completed successfully
    REASONING: We have successfully demonstrated copy (which duplicates text), cut (which moves text), and paste (which inserts clipboard content) operations in Notepad
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Notepad should be open with text that has been manipulated through cut, copy, and paste operations. The text should show evidence of these operations: duplicated content from the copy-paste, and repositioned content from the cut-paste. The user should understand how to select text and use Ctrl+C (copy), Ctrl+X (cut), and Ctrl+V (paste) keyboard shortcuts to manipulate text content.
