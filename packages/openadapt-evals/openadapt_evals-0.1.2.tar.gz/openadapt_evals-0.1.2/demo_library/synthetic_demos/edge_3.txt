TASK: Enable reading mode
DOMAIN: edge

STEPS:
1. Verify Microsoft Edge is open with a readable article or webpage
   REASONING: Reading mode can only be enabled on pages that contain readable article content; we need to ensure Edge is open with appropriate content
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

2. Look for the reading mode icon in the address bar
   REASONING: Microsoft Edge displays a book/reader icon in the address bar when a page is eligible for reading mode; this icon is typically located on the right side of the address bar
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

3. Click the reading mode icon in the address bar
   REASONING: The reading mode icon (book icon) is the primary way to activate reading mode; clicking it will transform the page into a clean, readable format
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.92, y=0.065)

4. Wait for reading mode to activate
   REASONING: The page needs time to transform into reading mode, removing distractions and reformatting the content for better readability
   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

5. Verify reading mode is enabled
   REASONING: Confirm that the page has successfully switched to reading mode, showing simplified text with removed advertisements and navigation elements
   ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The webpage should now be displayed in reading mode, showing a clean, distraction-free view of the article content with simplified formatting. The reading mode icon in the address bar should appear highlighted or active, indicating that reading mode is currently enabled. The page will display only the main article text and relevant images, with sidebars, ads, and other non-essential elements removed.
