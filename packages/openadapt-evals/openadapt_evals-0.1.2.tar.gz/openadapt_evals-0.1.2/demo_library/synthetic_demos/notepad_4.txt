TASK: Find text 'sample query'
DOMAIN: notepad

STEPS:
1. Open the Find dialog in Notepad
   REASONING: To search for specific text in Notepad, we need to access the Find functionality, which is typically done through the Edit menu or a keyboard shortcut
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "f")

2. Wait for the Find dialog to appear
   REASONING: The Find dialog needs time to render before we can interact with it
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

3. Type the search query in the Find field
   REASONING: We need to enter 'sample query' as the text we want to find in the document
   ACTION: TYPE("sample query")

4. Click the "Find Next" button to search for the text
   REASONING: After entering the search term, we need to initiate the search by clicking the Find Next button to locate the first occurrence of 'sample query' in the document
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.85, y=0.55)

5. Wait for the search to complete
   REASONING: Allow time for Notepad to search through the document and highlight the found text or show a "not found" message
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

6. Close the Find dialog
   REASONING: After finding the text (or determining it doesn't exist), we should close the Find dialog to complete the task
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.95, y=0.35)

7. Task completed
   REASONING: The search for 'sample query' has been executed and the Find dialog has been closed
   ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The Find dialog should open, search for the text 'sample query' in the Notepad document, and either highlight the found text or display a message indicating the text was not found. The Find dialog should then be closed, leaving the document visible with any found text highlighted.
