1. Open Microsoft Edge browser
   REASONING: We need to launch the browser to access the Collections feature and add a site
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Edge to fully load
   REASONING: The browser needs time to initialize before we can interact with it
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

3. Navigate to a website to add to collections
   REASONING: We need an active webpage open to add it to a collection
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.05)

   REASONING: Enter a specific website address that we want to add to our collection
   ACTION: TYPE("https://www.example.com")

5. Press Enter to navigate to the website
   REASONING: Load the webpage so we can add it to collections
   ACTION: HOTKEY("return")

6. Wait for the webpage to load
   REASONING: The page must be fully loaded before we can add it to collections
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

7. Click the Collections icon in the browser toolbar
   REASONING: The Collections icon (looks like a folder with pages) opens the Collections panel where we can manage our saved sites
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.92, y=0.05)

8. Wait for Collections panel to open
   REASONING: Allow time for the side panel to slide out and display
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

9. Click "Add current page" button in Collections panel
   REASONING: This button adds the currently open webpage to the selected collection
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.85, y=0.15)

10. Wait for confirmation
    REASONING: Allow time for the site to be added and the UI to update with confirmation
    ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

11. Verify the site appears in the collection
    REASONING: Confirm the task completed successfully by seeing the site listed in the collection
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The current website (example.com) should now appear as an entry in the Microsoft Edge Collections panel, with its title and URL saved for future reference. The Collections panel will display the added site with a thumbnail or icon, and the user can click on it later to quickly return to that webpage.
