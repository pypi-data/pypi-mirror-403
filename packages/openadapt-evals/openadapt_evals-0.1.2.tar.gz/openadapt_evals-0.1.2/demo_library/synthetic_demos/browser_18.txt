TASK: Enable/disable extensions
DOMAIN: browser

STEPS:
1. Open the browser's menu to access settings
   REASONING: To manage extensions, we need to access the browser's main menu where the extensions option is located
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.95, y=0.06)

2. Wait for the menu to appear
   REASONING: Allow time for the dropdown menu to fully render before interacting with it
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

3. Navigate to Extensions option in the menu
   REASONING: The Extensions submenu contains options to manage browser extensions
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.85, y=0.25)

4. Wait for the Extensions submenu to expand
   REASONING: Allow the submenu to appear showing extension management options
   ACTION: WAIT(0.3)

5. Click on "Manage Extensions" option
   REASONING: This opens the full extensions management page where we can view all installed extensions and toggle them on/off
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.82, y=0.28)

6. Wait for the Extensions page to load
   REASONING: The extensions management page needs time to load and display all installed extensions with their toggle switches
   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

7. Locate the toggle switch for the desired extension
   REASONING: Each extension has a toggle switch that enables or disables it; we need to identify the specific extension to modify
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.85, y=0.35)

8. Wait for the toggle action to complete
   REASONING: The browser needs time to process the enable/disable action and update the extension's state
   ACTION: WAIT(0.8)

9. Verify the extension status has changed
   REASONING: Visual confirmation that the toggle switch has moved to the opposite position (blue/on or gray/off) ensures the action was successful
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

10. Close the extensions tab or return to browsing
    REASONING: The task is complete; we can now close the extensions management page
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The selected browser extension should be successfully enabled (active and functional) or disabled (inactive and not running) based on the toggle action performed. The extension's toggle switch should visually reflect its new state, and the extension's functionality should be available or unavailable accordingly.
