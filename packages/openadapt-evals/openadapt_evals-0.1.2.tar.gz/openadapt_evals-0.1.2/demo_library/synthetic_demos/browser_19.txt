TASK: Open developer tools
DOMAIN: browser

STEPS:
1. Ensure a web browser (Chrome/Edge) is currently active
   REASONING: Developer tools are a feature of web browsers, so we need to have a browser window in focus to access them
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.5)

2. Press F12 key to open developer tools
   REASONING: F12 is the standard keyboard shortcut to toggle developer tools in both Chrome and Edge browsers, providing the fastest method to open them
   ACTION: HOTKEY("F12")

3. Wait for developer tools panel to appear
   REASONING: The developer tools panel needs time to load and render, typically appearing docked to the side or bottom of the browser window
   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

4. Verify developer tools are visible
   REASONING: Confirming that the developer tools panel has successfully opened with visible tabs like Elements, Console, Network, etc.
   ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The browser's developer tools panel should be visible, either docked to the right side, bottom, or as a separate window. The panel displays various tabs including Elements, Console, Sources, Network, Performance, and other debugging tools. The main browser viewport adjusts its size to accommodate the developer tools panel if docked.
