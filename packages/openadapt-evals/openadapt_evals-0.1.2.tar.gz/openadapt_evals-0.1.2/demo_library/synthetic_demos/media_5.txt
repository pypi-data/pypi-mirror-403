TASK: Skip forward 10 seconds
DOMAIN: media

STEPS:
1. Verify media player application is open and playing content
   REASONING: Before skipping forward, we need to ensure a media player is active with content currently playing or paused
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

2. Press the right arrow key to skip forward 10 seconds
   REASONING: In most media players (VLC, Windows Media Player), the right arrow key is the standard keyboard shortcut to skip forward 10 seconds during playback
   ACTION: HOTKEY("right")

3. Verify the skip forward action was successful
   REASONING: Allow time for the media player to process the skip command and update the playback position
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

4. Task completion
   REASONING: The media has been skipped forward by 10 seconds using the keyboard shortcut
   ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The media playback position should advance by 10 seconds from its current position. The time indicator in the media player should reflect the new position (e.g., if it was at 1:30, it should now show approximately 1:40). The video or audio content should continue playing from the new position.
