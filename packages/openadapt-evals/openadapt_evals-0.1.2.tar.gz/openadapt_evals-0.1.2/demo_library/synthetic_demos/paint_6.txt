TASK: Resize canvas
DOMAIN: paint

STEPS:
1. Open the Resize dialog in Paint
   REASONING: To resize the canvas in Paint, we need to access the Resize function which is typically found in the Home tab or Image menu
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.08)

2. Wait for the Resize menu to appear
   REASONING: The UI needs time to display the resize options after clicking
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

3. Click on the Resize option
   REASONING: This opens the Resize and Skew dialog box where we can modify canvas dimensions
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.12)

4. Wait for the Resize and Skew dialog to open
   REASONING: The dialog window needs time to fully render before we can interact with it
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Select the Pixels radio button
   REASONING: We need to choose whether to resize by pixels or percentage; pixels gives us exact control over canvas dimensions
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.35, y=0.45)

6. Clear the horizontal dimension field
   REASONING: We need to remove the current value before entering a new width
   ACTION: TRIPLE_CLICK(x=0.55, y=0.50)

7. Enter new width value
   REASONING: Set the desired width for the canvas (e.g., 800 pixels)
   ACTION: TYPE("800")

8. Clear the vertical dimension field
   REASONING: We need to remove the current value before entering a new height
   ACTION: TRIPLE_CLICK(x=0.55, y=0.57)

9. Enter new height value
   REASONING: Set the desired height for the canvas (e.g., 600 pixels)
   ACTION: TYPE("600")

10. Uncheck "Maintain aspect ratio" if needed
    REASONING: This allows independent control of width and height; may already be unchecked
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.35, y=0.65)

11. Click OK to apply the resize
    REASONING: Confirms the new canvas dimensions and applies the changes
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.55, y=0.80)

12. Wait for canvas to resize
    REASONING: The application needs time to process and redraw the canvas with new dimensions
    ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

13. Task completion
    REASONING: The canvas has been successfully resized to the specified dimensions
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The Paint canvas will be resized to the specified dimensions (800x600 pixels in this example). The drawing area will reflect the new size, and any existing content will be preserved or adjusted according to the resize settings. The Resize and Skew dialog will close, returning to the main Paint interface with the newly sized canvas.
