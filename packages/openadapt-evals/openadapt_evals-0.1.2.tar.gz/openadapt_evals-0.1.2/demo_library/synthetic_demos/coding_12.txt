TASK: Run a Python script
DOMAIN: coding

STEPS:
1. Open the Start menu to access applications
   REASONING: Need to launch a terminal or command prompt to execute the Python script
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Start menu to appear
   REASONING: Allow time for the UI to render before proceeding
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

3. Type "cmd" to search for Command Prompt
   REASONING: Command Prompt is the standard Windows terminal for running Python scripts
   ACTION: TYPE("cmd")

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: Allow time for the search to complete and display results
   ACTION: WAIT(0.8)

5. Click on Command Prompt application
   REASONING: Launch the terminal where we can execute Python commands
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.3)

6. Wait for Command Prompt to open
   REASONING: Allow time for the terminal window to fully initialize
   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

7. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script
   REASONING: Need to be in the correct directory to run the script; assuming script is in Documents folder
   ACTION: TYPE("cd Documents")

8. Press Enter to execute the directory change command
   REASONING: Confirm the navigation command to move to the Documents folder
   ACTION: HOTKEY("return")

9. Wait for directory change to complete
   REASONING: Allow command to execute before proceeding
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

10. Type the Python command to run the script
    REASONING: Execute the Python script using the python interpreter; assuming script is named "script.py"
    ACTION: TYPE("python script.py")

11. Press Enter to execute the Python script
    REASONING: Run the script and see its output in the terminal
    ACTION: HOTKEY("return")

12. Wait for script execution to complete
    REASONING: Allow time for the Python script to run and display output
    ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

13. Task completion
    REASONING: Python script has been successfully executed and output is visible in the terminal
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The Python script should execute successfully in the Command Prompt window, displaying any output or results generated by the script. The terminal will show the execution path, any print statements from the script, and return to the command prompt when complete.
