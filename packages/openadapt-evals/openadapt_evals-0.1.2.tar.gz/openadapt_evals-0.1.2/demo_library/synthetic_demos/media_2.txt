TASK: Pause/resume playback
DOMAIN: media

STEPS:
1. Check if VLC Media Player is already open with media playing
   REASONING: We need to verify the current state of the media player before attempting to pause/resume playback. If no media is playing, we need to start playback first.
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

2. Click on the VLC Media Player window to bring it into focus
   REASONING: Ensuring the media player window is active allows keyboard shortcuts and mouse clicks to be properly registered by the application.
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.5)

3. Pause the currently playing media by clicking the pause button
   REASONING: The pause button in VLC is typically located in the control bar at the bottom of the player window. Clicking it will pause the current playback.
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.07, y=0.95)

4. Wait for the pause action to take effect
   REASONING: A brief pause allows the media player to process the pause command and update the UI to show the paused state (play button visible instead of pause button).
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Resume playback by clicking the play button
   REASONING: After pausing, clicking the play/pause button again will resume playback from where it was paused. The button is in the same location as the pause button.
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.07, y=0.95)

6. Wait to verify playback has resumed
   REASONING: Allow time for the media player to resume playback and update the UI to reflect the playing state.
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

7. Alternatively, pause playback using keyboard shortcut
   REASONING: Demonstrate the alternative method of pausing using the spacebar hotkey, which is a common shortcut in most media players for pause/resume functionality.
   ACTION: HOTKEY("space")

8. Wait for the pause action to register
   REASONING: Brief delay to ensure the keyboard command is processed and playback is paused.
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

9. Resume playback again using the keyboard shortcut
   REASONING: Complete the pause/resume cycle demonstration by showing that the spacebar can also resume playback, providing users with both mouse and keyboard control options.
   ACTION: HOTKEY("space")

10. Verify playback is running normally
    REASONING: Final confirmation that the pause/resume operations were successful and the media is playing as expected.
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The media playback should be successfully paused and resumed multiple times using both mouse clicks on the pause/play button and keyboard shortcuts (spacebar). The media player UI should correctly reflect the current playback state (paused or playing), and the video/audio should stop and start accordingly without any errors or playback issues.
