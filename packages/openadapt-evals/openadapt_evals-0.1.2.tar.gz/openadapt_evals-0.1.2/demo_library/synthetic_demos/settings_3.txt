2. Wait for Start menu to appear
   REASONING: Allow time for the Start menu animation and rendering to complete
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Click on Settings icon in Start menu
   REASONING: Settings app is required to access system sound volume controls
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.08, y=0.85)

4. Wait for Settings application to load
   REASONING: Allow time for the Settings window to open and display all options
   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

5. Click on System category
   REASONING: Sound settings are located within the System category in Windows Settings
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.25, y=0.20)

6. Wait for System settings to load
   REASONING: Allow the System category page to fully render with all subcategories
   ACTION: WAIT(0.8)

7. Click on Sound option in the left sidebar
   REASONING: Need to access the Sound settings page where volume controls are available
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.35)

8. Wait for Sound settings page to load
   REASONING: Allow the Sound settings page to display with volume sliders and audio devices
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

9. Adjust the master volume slider
   REASONING: This is the primary control for adjusting system-wide sound volume
   ACTION: DRAG(start_x=0.65, start_y=0.30, end_x=0.55, end_y=0.30)

10. Wait to observe volume change

11. Task completed

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The system sound volume should be adjusted to a new level (lower in this case, as the slider was dragged leftward). The volume slider in the Sound settings should reflect the new position, and any audio playback should be at the adjusted volume level. The Settings app remains open on the Sound settings page showing the updated volume configuration.
