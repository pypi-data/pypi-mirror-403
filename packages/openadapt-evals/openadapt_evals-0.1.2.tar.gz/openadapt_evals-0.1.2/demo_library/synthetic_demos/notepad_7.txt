TASK: Enable word wrap
DOMAIN: notepad

STEPS:
1. Open Notepad application
   REASONING: We need to launch Notepad first to access its word wrap settings
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Start menu to appear
   REASONING: Allow time for the Start menu interface to fully render before proceeding
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Type "Notepad" to search for the application
   REASONING: Using search is the fastest way to locate and launch Notepad in Windows
   ACTION: TYPE("notepad")

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: Give the system time to find and display Notepad in the search results
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

5. Press Enter to launch Notepad
   REASONING: Execute the top search result which should be the Notepad application
   ACTION: HOTKEY("return")

6. Wait for Notepad to open
   REASONING: Allow Notepad window to fully load before interacting with its menu system
   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

7. Click on the Format menu
   REASONING: Word wrap settings are located in the Format menu of Notepad
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.12, y=0.06)

8. Wait for Format menu to expand
   REASONING: Allow time for the dropdown menu to fully display all available options
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

9. Click on "Word Wrap" option
   REASONING: This toggles the word wrap feature on, which will wrap long lines of text to fit the window width
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.12, y=0.10)

10. Verify word wrap is enabled
    REASONING: Task is complete - word wrap should now be active in Notepad, indicated by a checkmark next to the Word Wrap option in the Format menu
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Word wrap is successfully enabled in Notepad. Long lines of text will now automatically wrap to fit within the window width instead of extending beyond the visible area. A checkmark should appear next to "Word Wrap" in the Format menu when checked again.
