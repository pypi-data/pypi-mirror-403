TASK: Pin tab
DOMAIN: edge

STEPS:
1. Verify Microsoft Edge is open with at least one tab
   REASONING: We need an active tab in Edge to perform the pin operation
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

2. Locate the target tab to pin in the tab bar
   REASONING: Need to identify which tab we want to pin; typically we'll work with the currently active tab at a standard position
   ACTION: WAIT(0.3)

3. Right-click on the tab to open the context menu
   REASONING: The pin tab option is accessed through the tab's right-click context menu
   ACTION: RIGHT_CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.05)

4. Wait for the context menu to appear
   REASONING: Allow time for the menu to fully render before interacting with it
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

5. Click on "Pin tab" option in the context menu
   REASONING: This action will pin the tab, making it smaller and moving it to the left side of the tab bar so it remains persistent
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.12)

6. Wait for the pin action to complete
   REASONING: Allow Edge to process the pin action and reposition the tab
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

7. Verify the tab has been pinned
   REASONING: Confirm that the tab now appears as a smaller, pinned tab on the left side of the tab bar
   ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The selected tab should now be pinned in Microsoft Edge, appearing as a smaller tab icon positioned on the left side of the tab bar. Pinned tabs remain open across browsing sessions and cannot be accidentally closed with Ctrl+W. The tab will show only its favicon without the page title, taking up minimal space in the tab bar.
