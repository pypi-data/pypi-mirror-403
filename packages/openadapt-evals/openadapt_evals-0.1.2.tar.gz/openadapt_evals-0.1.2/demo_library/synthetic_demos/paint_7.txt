TASK: Save image as file_7.txt
DOMAIN: paint

STEPS:
1. Click on the File menu in Paint
   REASONING: Need to access the Save As functionality to save the image with a specific filename
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.05, y=0.02)

2. Wait for the File menu to open
   REASONING: Allow time for the dropdown menu to fully render before proceeding
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

3. Click on "Save as" option in the File menu
   REASONING: This will open the save dialog where we can specify the filename and file type
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.08, y=0.12)

4. Wait for the Save As dialog to open
   REASONING: The dialog window needs time to fully load before we can interact with it
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Clear the filename field and type "file_7"
   REASONING: Need to set the specific filename as required by the task
   ACTION: TRIPLE_CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.85)

6. Type the filename
   REASONING: Enter the base filename (without extension initially)
   ACTION: TYPE("file_7")

7. Click on the "Save as type" dropdown menu
   REASONING: Need to change the file format from default image format to text file (.txt)
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.92)

8. Wait for the file type dropdown to expand
   REASONING: Allow the dropdown list to fully display all available file format options
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

9. Scroll down in the file type list to find text file option
   REASONING: Text file format may not be visible initially and requires scrolling to locate
   ACTION: SCROLL(direction="down")

10. Select "Text Document (*.txt)" from the dropdown
    REASONING: This sets the file extension to .txt as required by the task
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.95)

11. Wait for the file type selection to register
    REASONING: Ensure the file type change is applied before saving
    ACTION: WAIT(0.3)

12. Click the Save button to save the file
    REASONING: Execute the save operation with the specified filename and .txt extension
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.75, y=0.95)

13. Wait for the file to be saved
    REASONING: Allow time for the save operation to complete and the dialog to close
    ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

14. Task completion
    REASONING: The file has been successfully saved as file_7.txt
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The current image in Paint should be saved as a file named "file_7.txt" in the default save location. The Save As dialog should close and return to the Paint application window with the image now associated with the new filename.
