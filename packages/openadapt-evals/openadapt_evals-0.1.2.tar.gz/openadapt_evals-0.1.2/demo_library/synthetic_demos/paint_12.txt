TASK: Fill region with color
DOMAIN: paint

STEPS:
1. Open the Start menu to access Paint application
   REASONING: We need to launch Paint to perform the fill operation
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Start menu to appear
   REASONING: The Start menu needs time to render before we can interact with it
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Type "paint" to search for Paint application
   REASONING: Searching is the quickest way to find and launch Paint
   ACTION: TYPE("paint")

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: The search needs time to find and display Paint in the results
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Click on Paint application from search results
   REASONING: This launches the Paint application
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.25)

6. Wait for Paint to fully load
   REASONING: Paint needs time to initialize its interface and tools before use
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

7. Click on the Fill with color tool (paint bucket) in the toolbar
   REASONING: The fill tool must be selected to perform a region fill operation
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.15)

8. Click on a color from the color palette
   REASONING: We need to select the color we want to use for filling the region
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.85, y=0.12)

9. Click on the canvas area to fill a region with the selected color
   REASONING: Clicking with the fill tool active applies the selected color to the connected region under the cursor
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.5)

10. Verify the fill operation completed successfully
    REASONING: The task is complete when the region has been filled with the chosen color
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: A region in the Paint canvas should be filled with the selected color. The fill tool spreads color to all connected pixels of the same color within a bounded area, effectively changing the color of an entire enclosed region with a single click.
