1. Open the Start menu to access applications
   REASONING: Need to launch the terminal application to execute the Python script
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Start menu to appear
   REASONING: Allow the system UI to render the Start menu before proceeding
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

3. Type "terminal" to search for the terminal application
   REASONING: Searching is the fastest way to locate and launch the terminal on Windows
   ACTION: TYPE("terminal")

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: Give the system time to display matching applications
   ACTION: WAIT(0.8)

5. Click on Terminal application in search results
   REASONING: Launch the terminal application to access the command line interface
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.35)

6. Wait for terminal window to open

   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

7. Type the Python command to execute the script
   REASONING: Enter the exact command needed to run the Python script file
   ACTION: TYPE("python script.py")

8. Press Enter to execute the command
   REASONING: Submit the command to the terminal for execution
   ACTION: HOTKEY("return")

9. Wait for script execution to complete
   REASONING: Allow time for Python to interpret and run the script, displaying any output
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

10. Verify script execution completed
    REASONING: Task is complete once the Python script has been successfully run and control returns to the command prompt
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The terminal window should display the output from running 'python script.py', with any print statements or results from the script visible in the console. The command prompt should return, indicating the script has finished executing.
