TASK: Open a new tab
DOMAIN: browser

STEPS:
1. Verify browser is open and active
   REASONING: We need to ensure a web browser (Chrome or Edge) is already running and in focus to perform tab operations. If no browser is visible, we would need to open one first.
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

2. Use keyboard shortcut to open a new tab
   REASONING: The most efficient and reliable way to open a new tab in any modern browser is using the Ctrl+T keyboard shortcut, which works consistently across Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and other browsers.
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "t")

3. Wait for new tab to load
   REASONING: Allow time for the browser to create the new tab and display the new tab page (typically a blank page, homepage, or new tab page with shortcuts).
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

4. Verify new tab is active
   REASONING: Confirm that the new tab has been successfully opened and is now the active tab in the browser, ready for user interaction or navigation.
   ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: A new browser tab should be opened and active in the browser window. The new tab will typically display a blank page, the browser's default new tab page with search bar and frequently visited sites, or the configured homepage. The tab bar at the top of the browser should show the newly created tab as the active/selected tab.
