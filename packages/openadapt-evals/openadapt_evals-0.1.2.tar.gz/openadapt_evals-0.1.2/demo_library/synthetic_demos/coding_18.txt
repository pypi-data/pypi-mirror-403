TASK: Search for text in files
DOMAIN: coding

STEPS:
1. Open the Start menu to access applications
   REASONING: Need to launch Visual Studio Code to perform file search operations
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Start menu to appear
   REASONING: Allow time for the Start menu animation and rendering to complete
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Type Visual Studio Code to search for the application
   REASONING: Quickly locate VS Code instead of manually browsing through program folders
   ACTION: TYPE("Visual Studio Code")

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: Allow Windows Search to find and display the application
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Click on Visual Studio Code from search results
   REASONING: Launch the application to access its file search functionality
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.25)

6. Wait for Visual Studio Code to fully load
   REASONING: Ensure the application window is ready and all features are initialized
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

7. Open a folder or workspace to search within
   REASONING: VS Code requires a folder context to perform comprehensive file searches
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "k", "ctrl", "o")

8. Wait for folder selection dialog to appear
   REASONING: Allow time for the file explorer dialog to open
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

9. Navigate to and select the target folder (e.g., Documents)
   REASONING: Choose the directory containing the files to be searched
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.4)

10. Confirm folder selection
    REASONING: Load the selected folder into VS Code workspace
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.75, y=0.85)

11. Wait for folder to load in workspace
    REASONING: Allow VS Code to index and display the folder structure
    ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

12. Open the Search panel using keyboard shortcut
    REASONING: Access VS Code's powerful search functionality to find text across all files
    ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "shift", "f")

13. Wait for Search panel to appear
    REASONING: Ensure the search interface is fully rendered and ready for input
    ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

14. Type the search query in the search box
    REASONING: Specify the text pattern to search for across all files in the workspace
    ACTION: TYPE("function main")

15. Wait for search results to populate
    REASONING: Allow VS Code to scan all files and display matching results with context
    ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

16. Review search results in the panel
    REASONING: Verify that search has completed and results are displayed with file names, line numbers, and context
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.35)

17. Mark task as complete
    REASONING: Text search has been successfully executed and results are displayed
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Visual Studio Code is open with a folder loaded, the Search panel is active showing results for "function main" with all matching occurrences listed by file name, line number, and surrounding code context. The user can now click on any result to navigate to that location in the file.
