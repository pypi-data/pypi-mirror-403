TASK: Set a breakpoint and debug
DOMAIN: coding

STEPS:
1. Open Visual Studio Code from the taskbar
   REASONING: Need to launch the IDE where we will set breakpoints and debug code
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Visual Studio Code to fully load
   REASONING: Application needs time to initialize before we can interact with it
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

3. Open an existing Python file or create a new one
   REASONING: Need a code file to demonstrate breakpoint and debugging functionality
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "o")

4. Wait for file dialog to appear
   REASONING: File explorer dialog needs time to render
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Navigate to and select a Python file (e.g., example.py)
   REASONING: Select a sample Python file that contains executable code for debugging
   ACTION: TYPE("example.py")

6. Open the selected file
   REASONING: Load the file into the editor so we can set breakpoints
   ACTION: HOTKEY("enter")

7. Wait for file to load in editor
   REASONING: File content needs to be displayed before we can interact with it
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

8. Click on the line number gutter where we want to set a breakpoint (e.g., line 5)
   REASONING: Clicking in the gutter area next to line numbers creates a breakpoint at that line
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.03, y=0.35)

9. Wait for breakpoint indicator to appear
   REASONING: Visual confirmation that breakpoint has been set (red dot appears)
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

10. Open the debug panel
    REASONING: Need to access debugging controls to start the debug session
    ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "shift", "d")

11. Wait for debug panel to open
    REASONING: Panel needs time to display debugging options
    ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

12. Click the "Start Debugging" button (green play button)
    REASONING: Initiates the debug session which will run the code and stop at breakpoints
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.05, y=0.15)

13. Wait for debugger to start and hit the breakpoint
    REASONING: Debugger needs time to initialize and execute code until reaching the breakpoint
    ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

14. Observe the debug state - highlighted line, variables panel, and call stack
    REASONING: Verify that execution has paused at the breakpoint and debug information is displayed
    ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

15. Step over to the next line using the debug toolbar
    REASONING: Demonstrate basic debugging control by executing one line at a time
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.12, y=0.15)

16. Wait for step action to complete
    REASONING: Allow debugger to execute the line and update the debug state
    ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

17. Mark task as complete
    REASONING: Successfully demonstrated setting a breakpoint and debugging with step execution
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Visual Studio Code should be open with a Python file loaded, a breakpoint set on a specific line (indicated by a red dot in the gutter), and the debugger running in a paused state at that breakpoint. The debug panel shows variable values, call stack, and debug controls. The user has successfully set a breakpoint, started debugging, hit the breakpoint, and performed a step-over operation to inspect code execution line by line.
