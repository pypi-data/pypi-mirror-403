EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The Chrome extensions management page should be open, displaying all installed extensions with toggle switches. At least one extension's state should be changed (either enabled or disabled), indicated by the toggle switch position and potentially a color change (blue for enabled, gray for disabled). The extension will be immediately activated or deactivated without requiring a browser restart.
