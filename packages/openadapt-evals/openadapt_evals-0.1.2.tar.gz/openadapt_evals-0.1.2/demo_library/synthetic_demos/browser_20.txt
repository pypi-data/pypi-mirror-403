TASK: Zoom in/out on page
DOMAIN: browser

STEPS:
1. Ensure browser window is active and in focus
   REASONING: Need to make sure the browser is the active window to receive keyboard commands for zooming
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.3)

2. Zoom in on the page (first zoom in)
   REASONING: Increase the zoom level to make page content larger using the standard keyboard shortcut
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "+")

3. Wait for zoom adjustment to render
   REASONING: Allow the browser to process the zoom change and re-render the page content
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

4. Zoom in further (second zoom in)
   REASONING: Demonstrate additional zoom in capability by increasing zoom level again
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "+")

5. Wait for second zoom adjustment to render
   REASONING: Allow time for the browser to apply the second zoom increase
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

6. Zoom in one more time (third zoom in)
   REASONING: Show that multiple zoom levels can be applied incrementally
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "+")

7. Wait for third zoom adjustment to render
   REASONING: Ensure the zoom change is fully applied before proceeding
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

8. Zoom out on the page (first zoom out)
   REASONING: Decrease the zoom level to demonstrate zoom out functionality
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "-")

9. Wait for zoom out adjustment to render
   REASONING: Allow the browser to process the zoom decrease and re-render
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

10. Zoom out further (second zoom out)
    REASONING: Continue reducing zoom level to show multiple zoom out steps
    ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "-")

11. Wait for second zoom out adjustment
    REASONING: Allow time for the browser to apply the zoom decrease
    ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

12. Reset zoom to default level (100%)
    REASONING: Return the page to normal viewing size using the reset zoom shortcut
    ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "0")

13. Wait for zoom reset to complete
    REASONING: Allow the browser to restore default zoom level and re-render the page
    ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

14. Task completion
    REASONING: Successfully demonstrated zooming in, zooming out, and resetting zoom level on the browser page
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The browser page should have been zoomed in multiple times (making content larger), then zoomed out multiple times (making content smaller), and finally reset to the default 100% zoom level. The user should understand how to control page zoom using keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + "+" to zoom in, Ctrl + "-" to zoom out, and Ctrl + "0" to reset).
