TASK: Run debugger
DOMAIN: vscode

STEPS:
1. Ensure Visual Studio Code is open and active
   REASONING: The debugger is a feature within VS Code, so the application must be running and in focus to access debugging functionality
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.5)

2. Wait for VS Code to be ready
   REASONING: Allow time for the application to fully load and be responsive before attempting to interact with debugging features
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Open a file with code to debug (if not already open)
   REASONING: The debugger needs source code to execute; opening a file ensures there's something to debug
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "o")

4. Wait for file dialog to appear
   REASONING: The file open dialog needs time to render before we can interact with it
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

5. Select a code file to open (e.g., a Python or JavaScript file)
   REASONING: Choose an existing code file that can be debugged
   ACTION: TYPE("example.py")

6. Confirm file selection
   REASONING: Execute the file open action to load the code into the editor
   ACTION: HOTKEY("enter")

7. Wait for file to load
   REASONING: Allow time for the file content to be displayed in the editor
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

8. Set a breakpoint by clicking on the gutter area (left of line numbers)
   REASONING: Breakpoints are necessary for the debugger to pause execution at specific lines for inspection
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.05, y=0.3)

9. Wait for breakpoint to be set
   REASONING: Visual confirmation that the breakpoint has been registered (red dot appears)
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

10. Start the debugger using keyboard shortcut
    REASONING: F5 is the standard VS Code shortcut to start debugging, which will launch the debugger and begin execution
    ACTION: HOTKEY("F5")

11. Wait for debugger to initialize
    REASONING: The debugger needs time to start the debug session, load the runtime environment, and reach the first breakpoint
    ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

12. Verify debugger is running
    REASONING: Confirm that the debug toolbar is visible and the debugger has paused at the breakpoint, indicating successful launch
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The VS Code debugger should be running with the debug toolbar visible at the top of the window, execution paused at the set breakpoint (indicated by a yellow highlight on the current line), and the debug sidebar showing variables, call stack, and watch expressions. The status bar at the bottom should display an orange/amber color indicating debug mode is active.
