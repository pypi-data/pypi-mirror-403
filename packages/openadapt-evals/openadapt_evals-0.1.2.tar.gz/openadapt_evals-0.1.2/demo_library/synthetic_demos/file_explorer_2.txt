TASK: Navigate to Documents
DOMAIN: file_explorer

STEPS:
1. Open File Explorer from the taskbar
   REASONING: File Explorer needs to be launched to navigate to any folder location. The File Explorer icon is typically pinned to the taskbar for quick access.
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.1, y=0.98)

2. Wait for File Explorer window to open
   REASONING: Allow time for the application window to fully load and render before attempting further interactions.
   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

3. Click on the address bar to prepare for navigation
   REASONING: The address bar allows direct navigation to specific folders. Clicking it will select the current path and allow typing a new destination.
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.05)

4. Wait for address bar to become active
   REASONING: Ensure the address bar is ready to accept input before typing the destination path.
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

5. Type the Documents folder path
   REASONING: Typing the direct path to Documents is the most efficient way to navigate there. This works regardless of the current location in File Explorer.
   ACTION: TYPE("Documents")

6. Press Enter to navigate to Documents
   REASONING: Pressing Enter confirms the navigation command and instructs File Explorer to open the specified folder.
   ACTION: HOTKEY("Return")

7. Wait for Documents folder to load
   REASONING: Allow time for the Documents folder contents to load and display in the File Explorer window.
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

8. Verify navigation is complete
   REASONING: The task is complete once the Documents folder is successfully opened and displayed in File Explorer.
   ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: File Explorer should be open with the Documents folder displayed, showing all files and subfolders contained within the user's Documents directory. The address bar should show the path to Documents, and the folder contents should be visible in the main viewing pane.
