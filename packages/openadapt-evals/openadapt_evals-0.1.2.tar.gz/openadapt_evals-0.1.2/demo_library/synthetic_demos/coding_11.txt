TASK: Open a Python file
DOMAIN: coding

STEPS:
1. Click on the Start menu to access applications
   REASONING: Need to open the Start menu to search for and launch a code editor or file explorer
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Start menu to open
   REASONING: Allow time for the Start menu interface to fully render before interacting
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Type "Visual Studio Code" to search for the application
   REASONING: Visual Studio Code is a common and professional IDE for opening Python files
   ACTION: TYPE("Visual Studio Code")

4. Wait for search results to appear
   REASONING: Allow the search to complete and display matching applications
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

5. Click on Visual Studio Code in search results
   REASONING: Launch the application to access its file opening capabilities
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.35)

6. Wait for Visual Studio Code to fully load
   REASONING: The application needs time to initialize its interface and workspace
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

7. Open the File menu using keyboard shortcut
   REASONING: Using Ctrl+O is the fastest way to access the file open dialog in most editors
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "o")

8. Wait for the file dialog to appear
   REASONING: Allow the file browser dialog to render completely
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

9. Type the Python filename or navigate to its location
   REASONING: Need to specify which Python file to open by typing its path or name
   ACTION: TYPE("example.py")

10. Wait briefly for file path to be entered
    REASONING: Ensure the filename is fully registered in the dialog
    ACTION: WAIT(0.3)

11. Press Enter to open the selected Python file
    REASONING: Confirm the file selection and load it into the editor
    ACTION: HOTKEY("Return")

12. Wait for the Python file to load in the editor
    REASONING: Allow time for the file content to be read and displayed with syntax highlighting
    ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

13. Task completed successfully
    REASONING: The Python file is now open and visible in Visual Studio Code with proper syntax highlighting
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Visual Studio Code should be running with a Python file (example.py) open in the editor, displaying the code with Python syntax highlighting. The file should be ready for viewing or editing.
