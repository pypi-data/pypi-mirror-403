TASK: Navigate to Documents
DOMAIN: file_explorer

STEPS:
1. Open File Explorer from the taskbar
   REASONING: File Explorer needs to be launched to navigate to any folder location. The File Explorer icon is typically pinned to the taskbar for quick access.
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.1, y=0.98)

2. Wait for File Explorer window to open
   REASONING: Allow time for the File Explorer application to launch and render its interface before proceeding with navigation.
   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

3. Click on the Documents link in the navigation pane
   REASONING: The Documents folder is accessible through the quick access navigation pane on the left side of File Explorer, which provides direct access to common user folders.
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.25)

4. Wait for Documents folder to load
   REASONING: Allow time for the Documents folder contents to populate and display in the main viewing area of File Explorer.
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Verify navigation is complete
   REASONING: Confirm that the Documents folder is now the active directory by checking the address bar and folder contents are displayed.
   ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: File Explorer should be open and displaying the contents of the Documents folder. The address bar should show "Documents" or the full path to the user's Documents folder (typically C:\Users\[Username]\Documents). The navigation pane should highlight the Documents entry, and any files or subfolders within Documents should be visible in the main viewing area.
