2. Wait for Start menu to appear
   REASONING: Allow the system UI to fully render before proceeding
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

3. Search for Command Prompt or Terminal

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: Give Windows time to find and display the Command Prompt application
   ACTION: WAIT(0.8)

5. Click on Command Prompt from search results
   REASONING: Launch the command line interface where Python scripts can be executed
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.25)

6. Wait for Command Prompt window to open
   REASONING: Allow the terminal application to fully initialize before entering commands
   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

7. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script
   REASONING: Need to be in the correct directory to locate and execute the target Python file
   ACTION: TYPE("cd Documents\PythonProjects")

8. Press Enter to execute the directory change command
   REASONING: Confirm the navigation command to move into the project folder
   ACTION: HOTKEY("return")

9. Wait for directory change to complete
   REASONING: Ensure the command has executed before proceeding
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

10. Type the Python execution command with script filename
    REASONING: Specify which Python script to run using the python interpreter
    ACTION: TYPE("python script.py")

11. Press Enter to run the Python script
    REASONING: Execute the command to start the Python script and see its output
    ACTION: HOTKEY("return")

12. Wait for script execution to complete
    REASONING: Allow time for the Python script to run and display any output or results
    ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

13. Task completed successfully
    REASONING: The Python script has been executed and output is visible in the terminal
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The Python script should execute successfully in the Command Prompt window, displaying any output, print statements, or results generated by the script. The command prompt should return to the active state, ready for additional commands, indicating the script has finished running.
