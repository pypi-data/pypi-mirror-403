TASK: Open Notepad

STEPS:
1. Click on the Start menu button
   REASONING: The Start menu provides access to all installed applications and is the standard entry point for launching programs in Windows
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for the Start menu to open
   REASONING: The Start menu needs time to fully render before we can interact with its search functionality
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Type "notepad" in the search box
   REASONING: Searching for Notepad by name is the quickest way to locate and launch the application rather than browsing through folders
   ACTION: TYPE("notepad")

4. Wait for search results to appear
   REASONING: The system needs time to process the search query and display matching applications
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

5. Click on the Notepad application in the search results
   REASONING: Clicking on the Notepad entry will launch the application
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.35)

6. Wait for Notepad to launch
