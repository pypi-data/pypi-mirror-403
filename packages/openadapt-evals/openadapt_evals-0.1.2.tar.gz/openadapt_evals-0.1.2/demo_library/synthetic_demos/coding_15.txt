TASK: Use terminal to run 'python script.py'
DOMAIN: coding

STEPS:
1. Open the Start menu to access applications
   REASONING: Need to launch the Terminal application to execute the Python script
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Start menu to appear
   REASONING: Allow time for the Start menu animation and rendering to complete
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

3. Type 'terminal' to search for the Terminal application
   REASONING: Quickly locate the Terminal app through Windows search functionality
   ACTION: TYPE("terminal")

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: Allow the search indexer to find and display matching applications
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Click on Terminal from the search results
   REASONING: Launch the Terminal application to access the command-line interface
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.35)

6. Wait for Terminal window to open
   REASONING: Allow time for the Terminal application to fully initialize and display the command prompt
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

7. Type the Python script execution command
   REASONING: Enter the command to run the Python script file named 'script.py'
   ACTION: TYPE("python script.py")

8. Press Enter to execute the command
   REASONING: Submit the command to the Terminal to begin executing the Python script
   ACTION: HOTKEY("Return")

9. Wait for script execution to begin
   REASONING: Allow time for Python interpreter to load and start running the script
   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

10. Verify script execution completion
    REASONING: Task is complete once the command has been successfully entered and executed in the terminal
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The Terminal application should be open with the command 'python script.py' executed, running the Python script. The terminal will display any output generated by the script, and the command prompt will return once the script finishes execution (or the script will continue running if it's a long-running process).
