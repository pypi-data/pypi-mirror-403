TASK: Set a breakpoint and debug
DOMAIN: coding

STEPS:
1. Open Visual Studio Code from the taskbar
   REASONING: Visual Studio Code is the primary IDE needed for setting breakpoints and debugging code
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Visual Studio Code to launch
   REASONING: Allow sufficient time for the application to fully load before proceeding
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

3. Open an existing Python file or create a new one
   REASONING: Need a code file to demonstrate breakpoint and debugging functionality
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "o")

4. Wait for file dialog to appear
   REASONING: File explorer dialog needs time to render
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Navigate to and select a Python file (or create new file)
   REASONING: Select a sample Python script that contains executable code for debugging
   ACTION: TYPE("sample_script.py")

6. Confirm file selection
   REASONING: Open the selected file in the editor
   ACTION: HOTKEY("enter")

7. Wait for file to load in editor
   REASONING: Allow the file content to be displayed in the editor pane
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

8. Click on the line number where breakpoint should be set (e.g., line 5)
   REASONING: Clicking on the gutter next to the line number is the standard way to set a breakpoint in VS Code
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.03, y=0.35)

9. Wait for breakpoint indicator to appear
   REASONING: Verify the red dot breakpoint indicator has been placed on the selected line
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

10. Open the Run and Debug panel
    REASONING: Need to access the debugging interface to start a debug session
    ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "shift", "d")

11. Wait for debug panel to open
    REASONING: Allow the debug sidebar to fully render with debug controls
    ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

12. Click the "Start Debugging" button (green play icon)
    REASONING: Initiate the debug session which will run the code and pause at the breakpoint
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.05, y=0.15)

13. Wait for debugger to start and hit the breakpoint
    REASONING: The debugger needs time to initialize, execute code, and pause at the breakpoint
    ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

14. Observe the debug toolbar and variable values
    REASONING: Verify that execution has paused at the breakpoint and debugging controls are available (step over, step into, continue, etc.)
    ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

15. Complete the debugging demonstration
    REASONING: The breakpoint has been successfully set and the debugger has stopped at that point, allowing code inspection
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Visual Studio Code should be open with a Python file displayed, a breakpoint (red dot) visible on a specific line number, and the debugger active and paused at that breakpoint. The debug toolbar should be visible at the top showing controls like continue, step over, step into, and stop. The variables pane should display current variable values at the breakpoint location.
