   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

5. Click on Visual Studio Code from the search results
   REASONING: Launch the IDE to access file opening capabilities
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.35)

6. Wait for Visual Studio Code to launch
   REASONING: The application needs time to initialize and display its main window
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

7. Open the File menu

10. Wait for the file explorer dialog to open
    REASONING: The system file browser needs time to initialize and display the file system
    ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

11. Navigate to the location containing Python files and type the filename or path
    REASONING: Need to locate the specific Python file to open; typing allows quick navigation
    ACTION: TYPE("example.py")

12. Wait for the file to be located in the dialog
    REASONING: Allow the file explorer to search and highlight the specified file
    ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

13. Click the "Open" button to open the selected Python file
    REASONING: Confirm the file selection and load it into the editor
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.85, y=0.92)

14. Wait for the file to load in the editor
    REASONING: The file content needs to be read from disk and rendered in the editor with syntax highlighting
    ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

15. Task completed successfully
    REASONING: The Python file is now open in Visual Studio Code and ready for viewing or editing
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: A Python file (.py) should be successfully opened in Visual Studio Code, displaying the file content with proper syntax highlighting, line numbers, and the filename visible in the editor tab. The user can now view, edit, run, or debug the Python code.
