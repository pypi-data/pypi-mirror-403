   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Click on the "Margins" or "Page" tab if not already selected

6. Click on the top margin input field
   REASONING: Begin configuring margins by setting the top margin value first
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.45, y=0.25)

12. Click on the left margin input field
    REASONING: Configure the left margin for proper text alignment and binding space
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.45, y=0.45)

13. Enter desired left margin value
    REASONING: Set the left margin measurement after clearing the existing value
    ACTION: TYPE("1.25")

14. Click on the right margin input field
    REASONING: Complete the margin configuration by setting the right margin
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.45, y=0.55)

15. Enter desired right margin value
    REASONING: Input the final margin measurement for the right side of the page
    ACTION: TYPE("1.25")

16. Click the OK or Apply button to save changes
    REASONING: Confirm and apply the new margin settings to the document
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.65, y=0.85)

17. Wait for the dialog to close and margins to be applied
    REASONING: Allow the application to process the changes and update the document layout
    ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

18. Task completed successfully
    REASONING: All page margins have been configured and applied to the document
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The document's page margins should be updated with the specified values (top: 1.0", bottom: 1.0", left: 1.25", right: 1.25"). The document layout will reflect these new margins, with text and content repositioned accordingly. The page setup dialog will be closed, and the changes will be visible in the document's page view.
