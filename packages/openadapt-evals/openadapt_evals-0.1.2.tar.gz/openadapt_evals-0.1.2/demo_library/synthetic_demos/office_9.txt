TASK: Apply formula in Excel
DOMAIN: office

STEPS:
1. Open the Start menu to access applications
   REASONING: Need to launch Excel or LibreOffice Calc to work with spreadsheets
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Start menu to appear
   REASONING: Allow time for the Start menu interface to fully load
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Type to search for Excel application
   REASONING: Quickly locate the spreadsheet application instead of manually browsing
   ACTION: TYPE("excel")

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: Give the system time to find and display matching applications
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Click on Excel or LibreOffice Calc from search results
   REASONING: Launch the spreadsheet application to begin working
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.35)

6. Wait for Excel to fully load
   REASONING: Ensure the application window and interface are completely ready
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

7. Click on cell A1 to start entering data
   REASONING: Set up example data to demonstrate formula application
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.22)

8. Enter first value
   REASONING: Create sample data for the formula to operate on
   ACTION: TYPE("10")

9. Press Enter to move to next cell
   REASONING: Confirm the entry and move to cell A2
   ACTION: HOTKEY("Return")

10. Enter second value in A2
    REASONING: Add another data point for calculation
    ACTION: TYPE("20")

11. Press Enter to move to cell A3
    REASONING: Confirm entry and move to the cell where formula will be applied
    ACTION: HOTKEY("Return")

12. Type the SUM formula
    REASONING: Apply a formula to calculate the sum of the two values above
    ACTION: TYPE("=SUM(A1:A2)")

13. Press Enter to execute the formula
    REASONING: Apply and calculate the formula result, which should display 30
    ACTION: HOTKEY("Return")

14. Click on cell A3 to verify formula was applied
    REASONING: Confirm the formula is active and showing the correct calculated result
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.26)

15. Task completion
    REASONING: Formula has been successfully entered and applied to calculate the sum
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Excel or LibreOffice Calc should be open with a working SUM formula in cell A3 that displays the value 30 (sum of 10 and 20 from cells A1 and A2). The formula bar should show "=SUM(A1:A2)" when cell A3 is selected, demonstrating that a formula has been successfully applied rather than just entering a static value.
