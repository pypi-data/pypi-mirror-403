TASK: Change playback speed
DOMAIN: media

STEPS:
1. Open VLC Media Player application
   REASONING: VLC Media Player needs to be launched to access playback speed controls for media files
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for Start menu to appear
   REASONING: Need to allow time for the Start menu interface to fully load before proceeding
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Type VLC to search for the application
   REASONING: Searching for VLC Media Player is the quickest way to locate and launch the application
   ACTION: TYPE("VLC Media Player")

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: The system needs time to process the search query and display matching applications
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Click on VLC Media Player from search results
   REASONING: This launches the VLC application so we can access its playback controls
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.25, y=0.30)

6. Wait for VLC Media Player to fully load
   REASONING: The application needs time to initialize its interface and components before interaction
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

7. Open the Playback menu in the menu bar
   REASONING: The playback speed controls are located within the Playback menu options
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.12, y=0.04)

8. Wait for the Playback menu to expand
   REASONING: Need to allow the dropdown menu to fully display all available options
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

9. Hover over or click on "Speed" option in the Playback menu
   REASONING: The Speed submenu contains preset playback speed options and custom speed controls
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.18)

10. Wait for Speed submenu to appear
    REASONING: The submenu needs time to render and display the speed adjustment options
    ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

11. Select desired playback speed (e.g., "Faster (fine)" for 1.1x speed)
    REASONING: Clicking on a specific speed option will adjust the media playback rate to the selected value
    ACTION: CLICK(x=0.25, y=0.22)

12. Verify playback speed change
    REASONING: Confirming the speed indicator has updated ensures the setting was applied successfully
    ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

13. Task completed successfully
    REASONING: The playback speed has been changed to the desired rate and is now active for media playback
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: The media playback speed in VLC Media Player should be successfully changed to the selected rate (e.g., 1.1x, 1.5x, or 2x faster, or slower speeds like 0.5x). The speed indicator may appear briefly on the video display or be visible in the playback controls, and any media being played will now play at the adjusted speed.
