TASK: Open a new tab
DOMAIN: browser

STEPS:
1. Verify browser is running
   REASONING: Before opening a new tab, we need to ensure a browser window is active. If the browser isn't already open, we would need to launch it first.
   ACTION: WAIT(0.5)

2. Use keyboard shortcut to open a new tab
   REASONING: The most efficient way to open a new tab in Chrome or Edge is using the Ctrl+T keyboard shortcut, which works universally across all major browsers.
   ACTION: HOTKEY("ctrl", "t")

3. Wait for new tab to load
   REASONING: Allow the browser to process the new tab creation and display the default new tab page (usually showing search bar and frequently visited sites).
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

4. Verify new tab is active
   REASONING: The new tab should now be the active tab in the browser, with the address bar focused and ready for input, confirming the task has been completed successfully.
   ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: A new browser tab is opened and becomes the active tab in the browser window. The tab displays the browser's default new tab page (typically showing a search bar and frequently visited sites or shortcuts), and the address bar is focused and ready for user input. The tab counter in the browser should increment by one.
