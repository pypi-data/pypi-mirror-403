        Compute the shortest paths between two nodes in a graph.

        in the graph `self.g` using their `query_name` attributes. The resulting
        paths are modified to replace the start and end nodes with their
        corresponding variable names.

        Parameters
        ----------
        source : OntoTerm
            The source node, represented as an OntoTerm object. The `query_name`
            attribute is used to identify the node in the graph, and the
            `variable_name` attribute is used to replace the start node in the path.
        target : OntoTerm

            attribute is used to identify the node in the graph, and the
            `variable_name` attribute is used to replace the end node in the path.
            If the `node_type` of the target is "object_property", the
            `variable_name` is appended to the path; otherwise, it replaces the
            last node in the path.
        num_paths : int, optional
            The maximum number of shortest paths to compute (default is 1).

            A list of destination nodes to which paths are to be queried. If None, queries will not be restricted to specific destinations.
        return_df : bool, default=True
            If True, the results will be returned as a concatenated pandas DataFrame. Otherwise, results will be returned as a list.
        num_paths : int, default=1
            The number of paths to retrieve for each query.
        limit : int, optional
            The maximum number of results to return. If None, no limit is applied.

        Returns
        -------
        pandas.DataFrame or list
            If `return_df` is True, returns a pandas DataFrame containing the query results.
            If `return_df` is False, returns a list of query results.

            The knowledge graph object that supports the `query` method.

        - The method assumes that the query string contains a SELECT DISTINCT
          clause if `return_df` is True.
        - The column names in the DataFrame are extracted from the SELECT clause
          by removing the leading '?' from variable names.
