**tools4RDF** is a Python toolkit for working with RDF data, SPARQL queries, and semantic networks. 

It allows one or more ontologies to be parsed and represented as Python classes, making it easier to navigate and explore their structure through features like autocompletion in interactive environments such as Jupyter notebooks. 

The aim is to make querying knowledge graphs with SPARQL more accessible to users without deep expertise in semantic
web technologies.

## 🚀 Features

- Load and serialize RDF graphs (Turtle, RDF/XML, N-Triples, etc.)
- Compose and run SPARQL queries programmatically
- Auto-discover ontology terms via dot-access
- Query graphs and return results as `pandas` DataFrames
- Perform graph merging and basic path reasoning

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install tools4rdf
```

Or:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge tools4rdf
```

---

## 📘 Example

```python
from tools4rdf import OntologyNetwork
onto = OntologyNetwork('http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/')
df = onto.query(
    'https://dbpedia.org/sparql',
    onto.terms.foaf.Person,
    onto.terms.foaf.familyName,
    limit=10,
)
```
