"""Python-C parallel KVFinder.

pyKVFinder detects and characterizes cavities in biomolecular structures.

The characterization includes shape, volume, area, depth, hydropathy and
interface residues and their frequencies.

In addition to the set of functions that can be imported into Python scripts,
it contains a command line interface (CLI).
