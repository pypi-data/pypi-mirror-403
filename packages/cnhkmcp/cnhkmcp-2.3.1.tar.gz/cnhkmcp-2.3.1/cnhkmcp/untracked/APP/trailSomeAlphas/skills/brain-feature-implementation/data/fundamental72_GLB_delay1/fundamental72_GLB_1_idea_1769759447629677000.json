    "idea": "**Concept**: Operating Cash Flow Persistence Ratio\n- **Sample Fields Used**: cf_cash_from_oper, sales_rev_turn\n- **Definition**: Rolling 8-quarter correlation between operating cash flow and sales revenue\n- **Why This Feature**: Stable conversion of sales to cash indicates sustainable business model; volatility suggests working capital management issues or revenue recognition concerns\n- **Logical Meaning**: Measures the reliability and predictability of cash generation from core operations\n- **Directionality**: Higher values (closer to 1) indicate stable conversion efficiency; lower/negative values indicate deteriorating cash conversion\n- **Boundary Conditions**: 1.0 = perfect linear relationship; 0 = no relationship; negative values suggest inverse relationship (potential accounting issues)",
