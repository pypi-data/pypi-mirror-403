# Caicurator

# Usage
Run `caicurator` to see this error message:

```

# Installation
## From Source
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Installation of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is required.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/eeriemyxi/caicurator.git
```

# Configuration
Caicurator uses a `config.ini` file to store all the configurations.

> [!TIP]
> Read about [INI file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file) to learn more about the format.

```ini
[common]
LOG_PATH = <default>

[auth]
TOKEN = ...

[browser]
HISTORY_FILE = ~/.config/vivaldi/Default/History

[fetch]
PATH = <default>
BATCH_SIZE = 4
SLEEP_RANGE = 1, 5
HTML_GEN_INTERVAL = 2

[html]
PATH = <default>
SORTING = newest
```

`<default>` means the default value will be used. Using this means the relevant content will be under the configuration directory, e.g., `.../chars`, `.../index.html`, and `.../logs`.

***
`common.LOG_PATH` is the path to the log file.
***
`auth.TOKEN` is the token that you get from [CharacterAI](https://character.ai/). You can find the token in the dev tools of your browser.
***
`browser.HISTORY_FILE` is the path to the history file of your browser. Only works with Chromium-based browsers.
***
- `fetch.PATH` is the path to the directory that contains all the character indices.
- `fetch.BATCH_SIZE` is the number of async requests that will be sent to the server.
- `fetch.SLEEP_RANGE` is the range of seconds that will be randomly chosen to sleep between each batch. 
- `fetch.HTML_GEN_INTERVAL` is the interval of generating the HTML page; e.g., `2` means generating the HTML page every 2 batches.
***
- `html.PATH` is the path to the HTML file.
- `html.SORTING` is the sorting method. It can be `newest` or `oldest`.
