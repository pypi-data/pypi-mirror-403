# Analyze a Platform-Level Outage

Objective:
This lab verifies your ability to reconstruct a platform-level
service outage by correlating architecture context, event timelines,
and operational evidence.

The goal is not to fix the system.
The goal is to explain what happened, in what order,
and why users were impacted.

---
Requirements:

You must reason strictly from the provided architecture context,
failure timeline, and outage events.

No assumptions about unobserved Azure behavior are allowed.

---
Task Requirements:

Edit the local file rca.md and document:

1. The sequence of failure events
2. The initial infrastructure failure
3. How the failure propagated
4. Why users experienced service degradation

Your analysis must follow the timeline of events.

---
Constraints:

Do NOT propose fixes or redesigns
Do NOT reference tooling or provisioning
Do NOT assume behavior not shown in evidence
Base all conclusions strictly on provided artifacts
Work fully offline and locally
