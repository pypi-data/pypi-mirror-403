title: Analyze a Platform-Level Outage
stack: azure
domain: reliability
difficulty: Hard
xp: 150

goal: >
  Reconstruct and explain how a localized Azure infrastructure
  failure propagated into a user-visible service disruption
  using architectural and operational evidence.

skills:
  - outage-timeline-analysis
  - failure-propagation
  - azure-reliability-reasoning

validator: validator.py

hint:
  - Focus on the sequence of events and explain how partial infrastructure failure escalated into user impact.

mentor:
  why: Understanding outage propagation is critical for resilient platforms.
  intent: applied
  guidance:
    before: |
      Separate the initial infrastructure failure from
      the downstream effects observed by users.
    after: >
      Your analysis should clearly explain why the failure
      escalated beyond the initial fault domain.

solution:
  overview: >
    Hard-level outage analysis evaluates the ability to correlate
    architectural design with observed failure timelines.
    The focus is on explaining propagation, not proposing fixes.

  approach:
    - Identify the first infrastructure component that failed
    - Correlate timeline events with architecture behavior
    - Trace how traffic redistribution caused secondary impact
    - Explain why user-visible degradation occurred

  professional_considerations:
    - Avoid speculative causes not supported by evidence
    - Preserve strict timeline accuracy
    - Separate detection from impact
    - Ensure causal reasoning is explicit and auditable
