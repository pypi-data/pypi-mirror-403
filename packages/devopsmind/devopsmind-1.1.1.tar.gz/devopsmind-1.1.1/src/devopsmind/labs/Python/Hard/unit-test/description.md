# Implement function that passes the unit test

Objective:

- Implement a Python function that satisfies all provided unit tests.
- Practice test-driven development by deriving behavior from tests.
- Demonstrate disciplined debugging and minimal implementation.

---
Requirements:

- A unit test file is provided by DevOpsMind.
- The solution must be written in Python.
- Only standard Python features may be used.

---
Task Requirements:

- Review the file test_utils.py.
- Create a new file named utils.py.
- Implement a function named multiply(a, b).
- The function must return the correct result for all test cases.
- No output should be printed to stdout.

---
Constraints:

- Do NOT modify the unit test file.
- Do NOT modify the validator.
- Do NOT hardcode test values.
- Do NOT add unnecessary logic beyond test requirements.
- Validation imports the function and executes test cases directly.
