goal: "Compute a valid execution order by resolving task dependencies using graph-based reasoning"

skills:
  - dependency-graph
  - algorithmic-thinking
  - topological-sort
  - problem-solving

hint: "Model tasks as a dependency graph and derive a valid execution order."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Many systems rely on dependency resolution to determine safe execution order. Engineers must reason about graphs, not hardcoded sequences."
  intent: stretch

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how dependency graphs encode ordering constraints.
      Focus on ensuring all prerequisites are executed before dependent tasks.
    after: |
      Consider how cycle detection or error reporting could be added in real systems.

solution:
  overview: >
    Resolving task dependencies requires reasoning about directed graphs
    and ordering constraints. This lab evaluates whether an engineer
    can derive a valid execution sequence dynamically rather than relying
    on hardcoded order.
  professional_reasoning:
    - Dependencies define partial order, not total order
    - Graph traversal ensures prerequisites are satisfied
    - Multiple valid solutions may exist for the same dependency set
    - Algorithmic correctness matters more than output aesthetics
  real_world_context:
    - Build systems resolve dependencies before execution
    - Deployment pipelines rely on dependency ordering
    - Package managers use similar logic for install order
