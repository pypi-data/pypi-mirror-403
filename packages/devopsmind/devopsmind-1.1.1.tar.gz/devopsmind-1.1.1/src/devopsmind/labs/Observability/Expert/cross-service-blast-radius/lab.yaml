stack: Observability
difficulty: Expert
xp: 300
goal: "Assess blast radius and prioritize services during multi-service incidents"

skills:
  - blast-radius-analysis
  - dependency-reasoning
  - risk-assessment

hint:
  - Impact often spreads through shared dependencies.
  - Not all services carry equal business risk.

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Expert engineers must reason beyond single services and anticipate cascading failures."
  intent: system-thinking

  guidance:
    before: |
      Review service dependencies carefully.
      Separate direct impact from secondary effects.
    after: |
      Reflect on how blast radius awareness reduces large-scale outages.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the engineer can reason across
    service boundaries to understand how failures propagate.
    Expert-level analysis focuses on impact scope, dependency
    risk, and prioritization rather than isolated symptoms.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Blast radius describes how far impact can spread
    - Dependencies determine risk propagation paths
    - Protecting critical services limits systemic failure
    - Prioritization is based on impact, not alert volume

  real_world_context:
    - Most large outages involve cascading service failures
    - Poor blast radius analysis delays effective response
    - Senior engineers are expected to think system-wide
