title: "Identify noisy alerts"
stack: observability
difficulty: Medium
xp: 100
goal: "Apply operational judgment to distinguish alert noise from actionable signals"

skills:
  - alert-triage
  - noise-reduction
  - operational-reasoning

hint: "Repeated alerts with the same source or message usually indicate noise rather than new incidents."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Alert fatigue reduces response effectiveness and can cause real incidents to be missed. Engineers must learn to recognize duplication and prioritize based on impact."
  intent: reasoning

  guidance:
    before: |
      Read each alert carefully and look for repetition, shared context, and relative impact.
      Focus on which alerts represent new information versus repeated symptoms.
    after: |
      Think about how alert grouping, thresholds, or deduplication rules could reduce noise.
