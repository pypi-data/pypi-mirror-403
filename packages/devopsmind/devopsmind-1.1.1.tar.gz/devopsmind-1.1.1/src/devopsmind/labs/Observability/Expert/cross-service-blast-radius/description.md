# Analyze cross-service blast radius during an incident

Objective:

- Evaluate how an incident in one service impacts dependent services.
- Identify blast radius and risk propagation paths.
- Practice expert-level judgment across system boundaries.

---
Requirements:

- Multiple services and dependencies are involved.
- Alerts and metrics span more than one service.
- The system state is preloaded to simulate a live production environment.
- The task must be completed fully offline.

---
Task Requirements:

- Review the provided service relationships, alerts, and metrics.
- Identify which services are directly and indirectly impacted.
- Describe the blast radius and potential risk propagation.
- Explain which services should be prioritized for protection.
- Record your analysis in **incident-analysis.md**.

---
Constraints:

- Do NOT run commands or scripts.
- Do NOT attempt fixes or configuration changes.
- Do NOT perform root cause analysis yet.
- Focus on impact scope, not resolution.
