title: "Evaluate escalation timing and organizational blast radius"
stack: Observability
difficulty: Expert
xp: 300
goal: "Decide when escalation helps versus harms during incidents"

skills:
  - escalation-judgment
  - organizational-awareness
  - risk-management

hint:
  - Escalation has a cost beyond engineering time.
  - Not every warning justifies waking multiple teams.

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Expert engineers consider organizational impact, not just system metrics."
  intent: escalation-discipline

  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider who will be disrupted by escalation.
      Balance urgency with confidence.
    after: |
      Reflect on incidents where escalation timing made things worse.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the engineer can assess not only
    system degradation but also organizational disruption when
    deciding escalation timing.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Escalation widens blast radius beyond the system
    - Timing matters as much as the decision itself
    - Premature escalation can slow recovery
    - Delayed escalation can amplify damage

  real_world_context:
    - Many outages worsen due to escalation chaos
    - Senior engineers are trusted to escalate responsibly
    - Good escalation decisions preserve trust across teams
