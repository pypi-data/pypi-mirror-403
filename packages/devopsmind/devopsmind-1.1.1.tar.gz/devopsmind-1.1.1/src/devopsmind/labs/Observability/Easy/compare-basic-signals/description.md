# Compare basic observability signals

Objective:

- Practice reviewing logs, metrics, and alerts together.
- Understand how different signals can present different views of the same system state.
- Avoid drawing conclusions when signals do not fully agree.

---
Requirements:

- Logs, metrics, and alerts from the same time window are provided.
- Signals describe normal operation with minor internal changes.
- The task must be completed fully offline.

---
Task Requirements:

- Review all provided signals.
- Describe what each signal indicates independently.
- Compare what the signals agree on and where they differ.
- Record your observations in **signal-comparison.md**.

---
Constraints:

- Do NOT run commands or scripts.
- Do NOT modify any signal files.
- Do NOT infer root causes.
- Do NOT escalate to incident conclusions.
- Focus on comparison, not diagnosis.
