title: "Perform RCA with partial observability data"
stack: Observability
difficulty: Hard
xp: 150
goal: "Produce a disciplined RCA when observability data is incomplete"

skills:
  - rca
  - uncertainty-handling
  - evidence-evaluation

hint:
  - Missing data limits confidence.
  - Strong RCAs state uncertainty explicitly.

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Real incidents rarely provide complete data; engineers must reason carefully without guessing."
  intent: uncertainty-discipline

  guidance:
    before: |
      Review what evidence is present and what is missing.
      Separate facts from assumptions.
    after: |
      Reflect on how overconfidence during incidents can cause harm.

solution:
  overview: >
    When observability data is incomplete, a correct root cause analysis
    prioritizes disciplined reasoning over certainty. This lab evaluates
    whether the engineer can distinguish what is known from what is unknown
    and avoid presenting speculation as fact.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
    - Clear RCAs explicitly state uncertainty and data gaps
    - Engineers must resist the urge to guess under pressure
    - Credible conclusions are bounded by available evidence

  real_world_context:
    - Monitoring gaps are common during real production incidents
    - Overconfident RCAs often lead to incorrect fixes
    - Senior engineers are expected to communicate uncertainty clearly
