# Evaluate escalation timing and organizational blast radius

Objective:

- Understand how incidents affect not just systems but teams and organizations.
- Practice deciding when escalation helps and when it causes harm.
- Balance urgency against disruption.

---
Requirements:

- A multi-team production system is experiencing instability.
- Alerts and metrics indicate degradation, not total outage.
- The system state is preloaded to simulate a live incident.
- The task must be completed fully offline.

---
Task Requirements:

- Review the provided alerts, metrics, and service ownership.
- Identify which teams are potentially impacted.
- Decide whether escalation is warranted at this stage.
- Explain the timing and scope of escalation (or non-escalation).
- Record your reasoning in **escalation-analysis.md**.

---
Constraints:

- Do NOT run commands or scripts.
- Do NOT assume escalation is always correct.
- Do NOT delay escalation without justification.
- Focus on organizational impact, not technical fixes.
