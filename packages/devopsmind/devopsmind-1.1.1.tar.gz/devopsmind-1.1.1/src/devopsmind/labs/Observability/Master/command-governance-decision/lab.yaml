  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the engineer can operate at the
    Incident Commander level, applying governance, policy,
    and leadership judgment during a major production incident.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Incident command prioritizes coordination over optimization
    - Governance provides guardrails under stress
    - Clear authority prevents conflicting actions
    - Communication strategy is as critical as technical response

  real_world_context:
    - Major outages are leadership challenges, not technical puzzles
    - Poor incident command erodes trust across the organization
    - Staff-plus engineers are expected to lead decisively and transparently
