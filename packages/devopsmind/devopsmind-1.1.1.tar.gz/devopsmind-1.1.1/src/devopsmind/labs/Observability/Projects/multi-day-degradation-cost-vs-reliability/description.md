# Multi-Day Degradation: Cost vs Reliability Decision

Objective:

Simulate a prolonged production degradation where the system remains functional
but at reduced reliability and increasing cost.

You are responsible for deciding:
- What level of degradation is acceptable
- Whether cost increases are justified
- How to respond to executive pressure
- What long-term changes are required

---
Scope:

This project spans multiple days of partial failure and recovery attempts.
There is no single “fix”.

---
Deliverables:

You must complete all of the following:

- degradation-assessment.md
- cost-reliability-decision.md
- executive-response.md
- long-term-plan.md

---
Constraints:

- Do NOT run commands or scripts
- Do NOT assume missing data
- Do NOT optimize for perfect reliability
- Every decision must acknowledge trade-offs

This project evaluates **judgment, not correctness**.
