  why: "Expert engineers are trusted to own irreversible decisions, not avoid them."
  intent: accountability

  guidance:

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the engineer can responsibly
    assess and own the risks of an irreversible incident decision.
    Expert-level behavior prioritizes accountability and clarity
    over certainty or comfort.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Irreversible actions must be justified, not rushed
    - Risk ownership includes downstream consequences
    - Refusing an action is also a decision
    - Clear ownership matters more than perfect outcomes

  real_world_context:
    - Many severe incidents involve irreversible choices
    - Lack of ownership often causes post-incident conflict
    - Senior engineers are judged on accountability, not luck
