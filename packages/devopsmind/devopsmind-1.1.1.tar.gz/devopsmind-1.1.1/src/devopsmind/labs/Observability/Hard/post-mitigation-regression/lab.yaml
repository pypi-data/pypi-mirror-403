  - rca
  - incident-analysis
  - regression-detection

hint:
  - Mitigation can mask symptoms temporarily.
  - Time-based evidence matters after recovery.

mentor:
  why: "Many incidents fail not during mitigation, but during recovery."
  intent: recovery-discipline

  guidance:
    before: |
      Review metrics before and after mitigation.
      Look for patterns that re-emerge.
    after: |
      Reflect on why post-mitigation monitoring is critical.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the engineer can recognize that
    temporary stabilization does not guarantee resolution.
    It focuses on identifying regressions and reasoning about
    why mitigations may fail over time.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Mitigations reduce impact but may not address causes
    - Regression analysis requires comparing pre- and post-mitigation states
    - Stability must be validated over time, not assumed
    - RCAs should explain why recovery failed, not just that it did

  real_world_context:
    - Many production outages recur shortly after mitigation
    - Engineers are expected to validate recovery, not declare victory early
    - Poor regression analysis leads to repeat incidents
