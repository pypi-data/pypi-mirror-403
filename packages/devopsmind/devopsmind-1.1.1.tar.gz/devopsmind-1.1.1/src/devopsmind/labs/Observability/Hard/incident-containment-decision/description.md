# Decide on incident containment actions

Objective:

- Practice making containment decisions during an active incident.
- Distinguish containment from root cause resolution.
- Communicate decisions clearly under uncertainty.

---
Requirements:

- Alerts and metrics from an ongoing incident are provided.
- The system state is preloaded and represents a live situation.
- The task must be completed fully offline.

---
Task Requirements:

- Review the provided alerts and metrics.
- Decide what immediate containment action(s), if any, should be taken.
- Explain why these actions are appropriate given the evidence.
- Explicitly state what actions should NOT be taken yet.
- Record your decisions in **decision-log.md**.

---
Constraints:

- Do NOT run commands or scripts.
- Do NOT attempt to fix the root cause.
- Do NOT assume certainty where evidence is incomplete.
- Focus on reducing impact, not permanent resolution.
