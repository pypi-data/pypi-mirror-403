title: "Design Argo CD Sync Behavior"
stack: argocd
difficulty: Medium
xp: 100

goal: "Design and document explicit Argo CD sync behavior for drift and failure handling"

skills:
  - gitops
  - argocd
  - sync-strategy
  - operational-design

validator: "validator.py"

hint: "Sync policy defines how Argo CD reacts to drift and failures."

mentor:
  why: >
    Clear and explicit sync behavior prevents unintended production changes
    and makes GitOps behavior reviewable before incidents occur.
  intent: applied
  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how automated sync differs from manual sync
      and what operators need to understand during incidents.

      Optional manual review (not required for validation):
      - Review Argo CD syncPolicy documentation
    after: >
      Your design should make drift handling and failure visibility obvious
      to anyone reviewing the configuration.
