  guidance:
    before: |
      Identify shared dependencies and coupling between applications
      using the provided GitOps manifests.

      Optional manual inspection (not required for validation):
      - Review Argo CD Application specs for shared sources
      - Inspect shared manifests for cross-application impact
      - kubectl explain application
    after: >
      Reflect on how shared configuration increases blast radius
      and how architectural boundaries can reduce it.

solution:
  overview: >
    Expert-level GitOps analysis focuses on understanding how shared
    configuration creates implicit coupling between applications.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Identify shared manifests and consumption paths
    - Map dependency relationships explicitly
    - Reason about failure propagation, not just failure cause
    - Propose architectural containment rather than tactical fixes

  real_world_context:
    - Minimize implicit coupling
    - Prefer explicit ownership boundaries
    - Balance reuse against blast radius
    - Ensure changes are reviewable and auditable
