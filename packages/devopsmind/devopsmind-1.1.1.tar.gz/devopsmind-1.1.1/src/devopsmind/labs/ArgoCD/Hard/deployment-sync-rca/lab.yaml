title: "Perform Root Cause Analysis for Argo CD Sync Failure"
stack: argocd
difficulty: Hard
xp: 150

goal: "Perform a structured, evidence-based root cause analysis using GitOps artifacts"

skills:
  - rca
  - gitops-failure-analysis

  - incident-analysis

validator: "validator.py"

hint: "Separate observable symptoms from underlying causes and support conclusions with evidence."

mentor:
  why: >
    GitOps failures must be diagnosed using declarative evidence rather than
    assumptions or runtime experimentation.
  intent: stretch
  guidance:
    before: |
      Identify observable facts from manifests and logs before forming conclusions.

      Optional manual inspection (not required for validation):
      - Review Argo CD Application specifications
      - Correlate sync events with failure timelines
      - kubectl explain application
    after: >
      Your RCA should be review-ready and defensible in a post-incident review.

solution:
  overview: >
    Hard-level GitOps RCA focuses on evidence correlation rather than fix implementation.
    Engineers must distinguish symptoms from causes and justify conclusions using
    declarative artifacts.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Identify the observable failure state
    - Correlate timeline and sync events
    - Trace failure to a concrete configuration or dependency issue
    - Propose a single, preventative corrective action

  real_world_context:
    - Avoid speculative root causes
    - Preserve evidence integrity
    - Separate containment from prevention
    - Ensure conclusions are auditable

execution:
  runtime: docker
  requires_execution: false
  required_tools:
    - kubectl
