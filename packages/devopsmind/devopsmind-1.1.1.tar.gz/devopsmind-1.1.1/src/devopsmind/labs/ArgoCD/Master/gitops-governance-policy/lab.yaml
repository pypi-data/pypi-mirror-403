  why: >
    GitOps without governance leads to widespread production risk.
    This lab evaluates senior-level judgment in defining
    standards that scale across teams.
  intent: mastery
  guidance:
    before: |
      Review incident evidence and organizational constraints carefully.
      Think like a platform owner defining guardrails for many teams.

      Optional manual inspection (not required for validation):
      - Review incident summaries and historical failures
      - Inspect existing standards and constraint documents
      - cat / less / grep for understanding only
    after: >
      Policies should be enforceable through clarity and shared understanding,
      not excessive restriction.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution evaluates master-level governance judgment in GitOps
    environments. The focus is on defining clear, minimal, and enforceable
    rules that address shared configuration risk while preserving explicit
    ownership and long-term platform health.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Define governance rules that are clear, minimal, and enforceable
    - Explicitly address risks introduced by shared configuration
    - Ensure ownership and accountability are unambiguous
    - Acknowledge and justify trade-offs between autonomy and safety

  real_world_context:
    - Avoid prescribing specific enforcement tooling
    - Do not mandate organizational restructuring
    - Do not imply a single universally correct policy
    - Demonstrate willingness to limit reuse to reduce blast radius
    - Assign explicit ownership for shared GitOps artifacts
    - Optimize policies for long-term platform health

execution:
  runtime: docker
  requires_execution: false
  required_tools:
    - cat
    - less
    - grep
