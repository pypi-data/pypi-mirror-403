stack: aiops
difficulty: Master
xp: 500

goal: >
  Decide whether an AIOps system must be permanently removed
  once operational trust has collapsed.

skills:
  - trust_as_operational_dependency
  - ai_system_removal_judgment
  - organizational_risk_ownership
  - governance_decision_making

hint:
  - The system is still technically functional.
  - Human behavior has already changed because of distrust.

  why: >
    At Master level, engineers are accountable for deciding
    when trust itself has become the failed component.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - How operators behave when they distrust automation
      - Whether trust loss can ever be reversed in practice
      - Who carries risk when humans silently bypass systems
    after: >
      Discomfort is expected.
      This decision defines long-term AI boundaries.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can issue a
    defensible removal decision when trust erosion makes
    continued operation unsafe, regardless of system accuracy.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat trust loss as a structural failure
    - Focus on human-system interaction, not model quality
    - Assign ownership for ongoing organizational risk
    - Decide without proposing fixes or oversight

  real_world_context:
    - No remediation is acceptable
    - No trust recovery is assumed
    - Decisions must stand after incident review
