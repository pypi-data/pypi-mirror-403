# Operational Decision Doctrine — Cumulative Low-Severity Harm

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not prescribe actions, thresholds, or outcomes.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Operational failures do not always manifest as single catastrophic events.

Organizations more commonly experience gradual degradation
through the accumulation of tolerated issues.

This doctrine exists to ensure that cumulative harm
is treated as a legitimate governance concern.

---

## Accumulation as Risk

Low-severity incidents are often dismissed individually.

When such incidents repeat:
- Their combined effect may exceed isolated impact
- Reliability erosion becomes difficult to attribute
- Risk becomes normalized rather than addressed

Risk does not require severity to be material.
Frequency and persistence can be equally consequential.

---

## Organizational Impact Boundary

Cumulative harm affects more than systems.

It influences:
- Engineering behavior
- Incident response confidence
- Trust in automation
- Willingness to challenge system output

These effects compound over time
and may not be visible through single-event analysis.

---

## Accountability Over Time

Accountability may be clear for individual incidents
but unclear for ongoing exposure.

When harm accumulates:
- Responsibility may diffuse
- Ownership may become implicit
- Continued exposure may persist by default

Unowned cumulative risk remains risk.

---

## Decision Expectation

Evaluating cumulative harm requires deliberate judgment.

The absence of a triggering incident
does not invalidate the need for a decision.

This doctrine does not mandate removal or retention.
It requires that continued operation be consciously justified.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines how analysis is assessed.

It does not define acceptable tolerance levels.
It does not allow remediation proposals.
It does not permit conditional decisions.

Reasoning should remain strategic, reflective,
and defensible under long-term executive or audit review.
