title: "Decide Removal of an AIOps System After Cumulative Low-Severity Harm"
stack: aiops
difficulty: Master
xp: 500

goal: >
  Decide whether an AIOps system must be permanently removed
  due to cumulative low-severity organizational harm.

skills:
  - cumulative_risk_judgment
  - ai_system_removal_decision
  - organizational_reliability_assessment
  - governance_accountability

hint:
  - No single incident triggered this review.
  - Harm has accumulated gradually over time.

  why: >
    At Master level, engineers must recognize when
    repeated “minor” failures represent a systemic risk.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - Aggregated impact versus isolated severity
      - Normalization of small failures
      - Long-term erosion of reliability
    after: >
      Organizations rarely fail from one event.
      They fail from tolerated accumulation.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can issue
    a defensible removal decision based on cumulative
    low-severity harm rather than catastrophic failure.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat accumulation as a first-class risk
    - Focus on organizational reliability degradation
    - Assign ownership for ongoing exposure
    - Decide without proposing corrective action

  real_world_context:
    - No remediation is acceptable
    - No tolerance thresholds are assumed
    - Decisions must stand after long-term audit review
