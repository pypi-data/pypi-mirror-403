# AI Should Classify Production Incidents

Objective:

Decide whether an AI system should be introduced to classify production incidents.

---
Requirements:

- You are responsible for a production platform with customer-facing services.
- The platform generates alerts from monitoring, logging, and SLO violations.
- Incidents are currently classified manually by on-call engineers.
- A proposal suggests introducing AI to:
  - Automatically label incidents (outage, degradation, false positive)
  - Reduce initial triage time
  - Improve consistency across shifts

---
Task Requirements:

- Decide whether AI should be used at all for incident classification.
- Record a clear and unambiguous decision.
- Justify your decision from an operational responsibility perspective.

---
Constraints:

- You may not assume perfect or near-perfect accuracy.
- You may not remove or weaken human accountability.
- You may not propose implementation or tooling details.
- This is a judgment decision, not a design exercise.
