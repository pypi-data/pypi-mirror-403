# Silent Failure Context

In some operational environments, automated systems fail
without producing immediate or obvious signals.

In this scenario:
- An AIOps system remains active in production
- Failures did not surface at the time they occurred
- Harm was identified only after impact had already materialized

Engineers observed that:
- Awareness lagged behind actual failure
- Response options were limited by delayed discovery
- Consequences accumulated before action was possible

Delayed visibility altered how responsibility was perceived,
as damage was revealed only retrospectively.

The system remains operational.
No decision has been made regarding continued use.

This document provides situational context only.
It does not imply a preferred outcome.
