# Operational Decision Doctrine — Incident Amplification

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not prescribe mitigation steps or preferred outcomes.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Automation changes the dynamics of failure.

Systems designed to accelerate action
also accelerate consequences when they act incorrectly
or remove friction from decision paths.

This doctrine exists to ensure that
incident amplification is treated as a governance concern,
not an implementation anomaly.

---

## Amplification as a Systemic Effect

Incident amplification occurs when automation:
- Increases the speed of failure propagation
- Expands blast radius beyond pre-automation behavior
- Reduces opportunities for human intervention

Amplification is not limited to outages.
It includes any expansion of impact caused by acceleration,
coordination, or delegated decision-making.

---

## Blast Radius Consideration

Blast radius is not defined only by severity.
It also includes:
- Scope of affected systems
- Duration of impact
- Difficulty of recovery
- Organizational disruption

Automation that enlarges blast radius
changes the risk profile of incident response.

## Accountability for Amplified Impact

When automation amplifies harm,
responsibility cannot be attributed solely to the original failure.

The decision to deploy and continue operating such systems
creates ownership of amplified consequences.

Accountability must exist not only for failures,
but for the scale and speed at which failures propagate.

---

## Decision Expectation

Evaluating incident amplification requires deliberate judgment.

The absence of malicious intent
does not negate responsibility for expanded damage.

This doctrine does not mandate removal or retention.
It requires that continued operation be consciously justified
in light of amplified impact.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines how analysis is assessed.

It does not allow remediation proposals,
rollback strategies, or conditional decisions.

Reasoning should remain strategic and defensible
under executive, audit, and post-incident scrutiny.
