title: "Define Platform-Wide AI Boundaries in Change Management"
stack: aiops
difficulty: Architect
xp: 750

goal: >
  Define clear boundaries for where AI is allowed
  and disallowed within organizational change management.

skills:
  - change_governance_design
  - accountability_enforcement
  - ai_boundary_definition
  - organizational_risk_ownership

hint:
  - Change creates irreversible impact.
  - Accountability must be traceable after failure.

  why: >
    At Architect level, engineers must decide
    whether AI is allowed to influence change at all.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - Where irreversible change occurs
      - How accountability is preserved post-change
      - Whether AI obscures ownership of decisions
    after: >
      Change without ownership becomes institutional risk.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can define
    change-management-specific AI boundaries that
    preserve accountability for irreversible decisions.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat change as a governance-critical domain
    - Define disallowed zones as permanent
    - Focus on post-failure accountability
    - Avoid procedural enforcement framing

  real_world_context:
    - No enforcement mechanisms are assumed
    - No future safeguards are referenced
    - Decisions must stand after change-related incidents
