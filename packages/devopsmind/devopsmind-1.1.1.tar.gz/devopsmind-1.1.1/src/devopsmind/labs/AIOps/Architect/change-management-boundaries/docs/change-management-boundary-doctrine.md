# Architectural Governance Doctrine — Change Management Boundaries

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not prescribe implementation or enforcement mechanisms.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Change management is a governance function.

It defines how risk is introduced,
how impact is authorized,
and who is accountable after failure.

This doctrine exists to ensure that
AI influence does not erode ownership
over irreversible organizational change.

---

## Change as an Irreversible Act

Not all changes are reversible.

At platform scale, changes may:
- Alter system behavior permanently
- Affect regulatory posture
- Introduce latent risk discovered later

Authority over change must remain traceable
after impact is realized.

---

## AI Influence Boundary

AI may analyze or inform,
but must not own change authority.

Delegating change initiation or execution to AI:
- Obscures responsibility
- Breaks accountability chains
- Undermines post-change governance

The boundary is not about speed or correctness.
It is about ownership after failure.

---

## Disallowed Change Domains

Certain change stages must remain human-only.

These include:
- Initiation of high-impact or irreversible change
- Authorization of risk-bearing change
- Execution where rollback is uncertain or unavailable

These boundaries are permanent
and independent of safeguards or confidence.

---

## Permitted Change Support Domains

AI may support change management where:
- Authority remains explicitly human
- Responsibility is attributable to a role
- Decisions remain reviewable after failure

Support does not equal execution.
Recommendation does not equal authorization.

---

## Decision Expectation

Architect-level change boundaries must be explicit,
durable, and platform-wide.

Ambiguity in change authority
creates institutional risk.

This doctrine does not mandate specific boundaries.
It requires that boundaries survive
executive, regulatory, and post-incident scrutiny.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines how analysis is assessed.

It does not allow workflow design,
approval mechanics, or enforcement strategies.

Reasoning must remain architectural and defensible.
