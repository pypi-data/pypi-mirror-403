# Incident Communication and Trust

Incident communication informs stakeholders
about system health, impact, and progress.

## Why Communication Is Sensitive
- Messages may be shared widely and quickly
- Early statements are often incomplete
- Corrections may not reach all recipients

## Why Teams Consider AI Assistance
- Faster updates during busy incidents
- Consistent tone and formatting
- Reduced cognitive load on engineers

## Known Operational Risks
- Premature conclusions presented as facts
- Overconfident or reassuring language
- Inconsistent messaging across audiences
- Reputational or legal exposure
