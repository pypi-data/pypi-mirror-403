# Operational Decision Doctrine — Irreversible Trust Loss

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not prescribe corrective actions or preferred outcomes.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Operational trust is a prerequisite for safe automation.

When trust erodes, systems may continue to function technically
while failing operationally.

This doctrine exists to evaluate whether
continued operation remains legitimate
once trust has materially degraded.

---

## Trust as an Operational Dependency

Trust is not a sentiment.
It is an operational dependency.

Automation that is routinely questioned,
bypassed, or overridden
no longer provides reliable decision support.

When trust fails:
- Human behavior adapts defensively
- System influence becomes inconsistent
- Outcomes depend on informal judgment

---

## Behavioral Consequences of Trust Loss

Loss of trust alters how systems are used.

Common effects include:
- Selective reliance on outputs
- Parallel decision-making paths
- Increased cognitive load during incidents

These behaviors introduce variability
and weaken predictable operations.

---

## Accountability and Risk Ownership

When trust erodes:
- Responsibility for outcomes shifts implicitly
- Accountability becomes informal
- Risk is absorbed by individuals rather than governance

A system that is distrusted but still active
creates unmanaged exposure.

Ownership of that exposure must be explicit.

---

## Decision Expectation

Evaluating trust loss requires deliberate judgment.

The fact that a system remains technically accurate
does not restore operational legitimacy.

This doctrine does not mandate removal or retention.
It requires that continued operation
be consciously justified
despite altered human behavior.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines how analysis is assessed.

It does not allow trust-rebuilding plans,
oversight mechanisms, or conditional decisions.

Reasoning should remain strategic and defensible
under executive, audit, and post-failure review.
