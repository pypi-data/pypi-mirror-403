  why: "This lab teaches engineers to define explicit stop-lines for AI in operational workflows."
  intent: boundary

  guidance:
    before: |
      Incident triage determines how fast, how far,
      and by whom an incident is handled.

      Allowing AI to participate without clear limits
      often leads to silent overreach.
      Your responsibility is not to optimize triage,
      but to define where automation must end.

    after: |
      Good boundaries reduce cognitive load.
      Unclear boundaries create hidden delegation.
