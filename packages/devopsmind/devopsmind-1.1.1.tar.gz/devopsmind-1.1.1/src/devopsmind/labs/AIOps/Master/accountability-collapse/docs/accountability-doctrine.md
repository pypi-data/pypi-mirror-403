# Operational Accountability Doctrine — Automated Decision Systems

This document defines the accountability standards
applied when evaluating the continued operation
of automated or AI-driven systems.

It does not prescribe corrective actions,
implementation steps, or preferred decisions.

## Purpose of This Doctrine

This doctrine exists to enforce a core governance principle:

Operational authority must be paired with accountable ownership.

Systems that influence or determine outcomes
introduce risk that must be explicitly owned.
When ownership cannot be clearly assigned,
governance boundaries are violated.

This doctrine evaluates accountability as a prerequisite,
not as an outcome to be restored.

---

## Accountability as a Governance Requirement

Accountability is not inferred from intent, role titles,
or organizational diagrams.

Accountability exists only when:
- A role or authority explicitly owns outcomes
- Responsibility is acknowledged before failure
- Liability can be enforced after failure

Systems operating without such ownership
are not governable.

---

## Accountability Collapse Definition

An accountability collapse exists when:
- Outcomes occur without a clear owner
- Responsibility shifts after failure
- No authority can be held answerable for harm

Diffuse responsibility is not shared accountability.
It is the absence of accountability.

---

## Risk Ownership Boundary

Risk that cannot be assigned is unmanaged.

Unmanaged risk cannot be implicitly accepted
through continued operation or organizational inertia.

Allowing a system to remain active
without accountable ownership
constitutes a governance failure,
regardless of past performance or perceived value.

---

## Decision Authority Expectation

The decision to allow continued operation
of an automated system is a human governance act.

Failure to make a decision
is itself a decision to accept ongoing exposure.

Responsibility for that exposure
rests with the authority that permits continued operation.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines how accountability reasoning is evaluated.

It does not define correct answers.
It does not recommend outcomes.
It does not permit conditional or reversible judgments.

Judgment must stand independently
under executive review, audit scrutiny,
and post-failure examination.
