# AI Usage Decision Context

You are evaluating whether AI should be introduced
into an operational workflow.

The problem is solvable without AI.
AI has been proposed as an enhancement, not a necessity.

There is no incident.
There is no failure.

Your task is to decide whether AI belongs here at all,
based on risk, determinism, and accountability.
