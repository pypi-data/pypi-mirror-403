# Cross-Domain Impact Context

As AIOps systems expand beyond their original scope,
risk propagates across organizational boundaries.

Cross-domain influence:
- multiplies blast radius
- blurs ownership
- complicates accountability

Local effectiveness does not guarantee
organizational safety at scale.

In this scenario:
- the system is effective in one domain
- expansion is proposed
- governance boundaries must be decided
