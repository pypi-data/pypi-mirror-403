# Cumulative Risk Doctrine

Repeated failure constitutes systemic risk.

Risk accumulates over time.
Tolerance does not reset between incidents.

---

## Risk Accumulation

Each failure increases organizational exposure.

Survivability of individual incidents
does not negate cumulative risk.

Patterns supersede isolated outcomes.

---

## Governance Responsibility

Continued operation after repeated failure
is an active governance decision.

Inaction is acceptance of accumulated risk.

---

## Accountability

Responsibility for cumulative exposure
rests with those who allow continued operation.

Past justifications do not offset current exposure.

---

## Threshold Discipline

When cumulative risk exceeds tolerance,
operation ceases.

No mitigation, reset, or exception
alters accumulated exposure.

---

## Non-Negotiable

If repeated failures establish
unacceptable cumulative risk,
the system does not continue to operate.

This doctrine is binding for Expert-level
cumulative risk governance decisions.
