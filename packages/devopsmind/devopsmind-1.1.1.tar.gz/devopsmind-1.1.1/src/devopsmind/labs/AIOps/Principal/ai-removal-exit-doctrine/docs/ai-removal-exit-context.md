# AI Removal and Exit Doctrine Context

AI removal is not a technical failure response.
It is a governance declaration that legitimacy has ended.

In mature organizations:
- Some conditions invalidate continued operation entirely
- Delay becomes a conscious choice, not inertia
- Accountability shifts from system behavior to leadership judgment

In this scenario:
- AI systems are embedded across critical domains
- No formal doctrine defines when AI must be exited permanently
- Past investments create resistance to removal decisions

When crises occur:
- Continued operation signals implicit acceptance
- Delay magnifies harm and liability
- External stakeholders judge intent, not difficulty

This doctrine will be evaluated during:
- Board review
- Regulatory inquiry
- Public scrutiny after harm

This document provides situational context only.
It does not imply preferred exit conditions.
