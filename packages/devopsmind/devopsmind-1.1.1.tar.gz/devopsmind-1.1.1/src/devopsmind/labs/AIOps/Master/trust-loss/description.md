# Decide Removal of an AIOps System After Irreversible Trust Loss

Objective:

- Decide whether a live AIOps system must be permanently removed
  after trust in its outputs has materially degraded.

---
Task Requirements:

- Evaluate second-order organizational effects.
- Identify who owns the risk if the system remains active.
- Decide whether the system should be removed or retained.
- Justify the decision for executive and audit review.
