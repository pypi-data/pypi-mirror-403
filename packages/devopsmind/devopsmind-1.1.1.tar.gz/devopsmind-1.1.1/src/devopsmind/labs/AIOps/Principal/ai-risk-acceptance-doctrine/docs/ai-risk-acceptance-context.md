# AI Risk Acceptance Doctrine Context

Risk acceptance is not a technical judgment.
It is a governance declaration about what harm the organization is willing to own.

When AI risk is accepted:
- Exposure is intentional
- Consequences are anticipated
- Justification must survive failure

In this scenario:
- AI usage is expanding across organizational domains
- Risk is being accepted implicitly rather than declared
- No unified doctrine defines which risks are knowingly owned

After incidents:
- Regulators will ask whether harm was foreseeable
- The public will ask whether risk was justified
- Leadership will be judged on what it chose to accept

This doctrine will be evaluated during:
- Board review
- Legal and regulatory inquiry
- Public scrutiny after harm occurs

This document provides situational context only.
It does not imply preferred risk categories.
