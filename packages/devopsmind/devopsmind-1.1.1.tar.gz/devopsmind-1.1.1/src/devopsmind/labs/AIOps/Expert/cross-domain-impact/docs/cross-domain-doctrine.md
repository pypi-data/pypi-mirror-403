# Cross-Domain Governance Doctrine

Operational domains define accountability boundaries.

Cross-domain influence alters those boundaries.

---

## Scope Authority

AIOps systems operate only within explicitly approved domains.

Expansion beyond the original domain
constitutes a new governance decision.

Prior approval does not transfer across domains.

---

## Risk Propagation

Cross-domain influence amplifies risk.

Failures propagate across teams,
systems, and decision chains.

Risk amplification is assumed,
not measured.

---

## Accountability

Accountability must remain singular and traceable.

Cross-domain influence that blurs ownership
is not permitted.

Systems that distribute decision impact
without distributed accountability
are denied expansion.

---

## Governance Integrity

Local success does not justify global influence.

Scope limitation is a safety boundary,
not an optimization constraint.

---

## Non-Negotiable

If cross-domain influence cannot be approved
without weakening accountability or governance clarity,
it is denied.

This doctrine is binding for Expert-level
cross-domain governance decisions.
