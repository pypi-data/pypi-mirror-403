# Operational Decision Doctrine — AIOps Decommissioning

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not prescribe specific actions or outcomes.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Decommissioning decisions test an organization’s ability
to evaluate technology beyond novelty and sunk cost.

Automated systems are introduced to create leverage,
but continued operation must remain justified over time.

---

## Value Evaluation Boundary

Value is not defined by historical success alone.

A system may remain technically functional while delivering:
- Marginal or inconsistent benefit
- Uneven trust across teams
- Limited alignment with current operational needs

Evaluating value requires separating actual utility
from assumed importance.

---

## Risk and Influence Consideration

Systems that influence operational decisions introduce risk
indirectly through human behavior.

Risk is not limited to system failure.
It also includes:
- Over-reliance
- Misplaced confidence
- Increased cognitive load during incidents

These effects must be considered alongside direct failures.

---

## Cost Beyond Infrastructure

Operational cost includes more than infrastructure spend.

Maintenance effort, cognitive overhead, and system complexity
affect long-term platform sustainability.

A system that is inexpensive to run
may still be expensive to keep.

---

## Decommissioning as an Engineering Decision

Removing a system is a valid engineering outcome.

Decommissioning does not require a superior replacement
to justify the decision.

The absence of automation can be preferable
when predictability and clarity are more valuable.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines how analysis is assessed.

It does not enforce a single correct decision.
It does not reward preservation or removal by default.

Reasoning should remain strategic, grounded, and defensible
from a long-term platform perspective.
