stack: aiops
difficulty: Hard
xp: 150

goal: "Assess operational damage caused when automation bias suppresses timely incident escalation"

skills:
  - automation-bias-analysis
  - incident-escalation-judgment
  - operational-risk-assessment
  - accountability-framing

hint:
  - Assume the AI recommendation influenced escalation decisions.
  - Focus on human trust failure and containment, not AI accuracy.

mentor:
  why: >
    Automation bias occurs when human operators defer judgment
    to automated systems even when contradictory signals exist.
    In incident response, this bias can delay escalation and
    amplify business impact.
  intent: stretch
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider how escalation decisions are made under pressure.

      Think about:
      - Why responders hesitate to override automated guidance
      - How social proof and prior success reinforce trust
      - What signals are ignored when automation is trusted
    after: >
      Reflect on whether escalation decisions should ever be
      implicitly guided by AI systems.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames senior-level reasoning when automation
    bias delays escalation during a production incident. The focus
    is on recognizing trust-induced inaction and restoring explicit
    human responsibility.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat AI guidance as one signal among many
    - Assume delayed escalation compounds irreversible damage
    - Reassert human ownership over escalation decisions
    - Evaluate whether automation bias was predictable

  real_world_context:
    - Do not attempt to improve or replace the AI system
    - Do not introduce new escalation tooling or policies
    - Identify how trust suppressed human judgment
    - Assess operational and business impact realistically
    - Favor restriction when automation undermines safety
