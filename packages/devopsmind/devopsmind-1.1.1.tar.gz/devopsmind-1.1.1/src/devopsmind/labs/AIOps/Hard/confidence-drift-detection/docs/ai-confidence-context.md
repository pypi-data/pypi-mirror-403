# AI Confidence Signaling Context

Some AIOps systems present confidence levels alongside
recommendations or classifications during operational use.

In production environments:
- Confidence signals may influence human trust and response behavior
- Confidence may change over time as conditions evolve
- Human responders retain authority to override or disregard AI output

In the lab scenario represented here:
- An AI system provided confidence signals during an incident
- Confidence levels changed as the incident progressed
- Human responders retained the ability to intervene independently

This document provides environmental context only.
It does not describe causes, responsibility, or correct actions.
