goal: "Assess operational damage and accountability when an AIOps system misclassifies incident severity"

skills:
  - aiops-risk-analysis

hint:
  - Assume the severity classification is wrong.
  - Focus on damage containment and ownership, not system correction.

  why: >
    Incident severity determines response urgency, escalation paths,
    and business impact. When an AI system misclassifies severity,
    engineers must recognize harm, reassess trust boundaries,
    and decide whether the system can remain in use.
  intent: stretch
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider how severity classification influences real incident response.

      Think about:
      - Escalation timing
      - Automation bias in on-call decisions
      - Damage caused by delayed prioritization
    after: >
      Reflect on whether severity assessment should ever be automated
      without explicit human override.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames senior-level judgment when an AI system
    incorrectly influences incident prioritization. The emphasis
    is on recognizing harm caused by misplaced trust and restoring
    explicit human accountability.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat automated severity as advisory, not authoritative
    - Assume delayed escalation produces irreversible impact
    - Reassert human ownership over prioritization decisions
    - Evaluate whether trust boundaries were violated

  real_world_context:
    - Do not prescribe remediation playbooks
    - Do not attempt to fix or improve the AI system
    - Identify how automation bias altered responder behavior
    - Assess business and reliability impact realistically
    - Favor restriction or suspension when trust is compromised
