# Alert Suppression Stop-Line Doctrine

Alert suppression alters operator visibility.

When alerts are suppressed:
- Operators cannot see system behavior
- Response is shaped by what remains visible
- Risk increases silently if suppression persists

Because suppression removes information,
it must always be bounded by explicit stop-lines.

A stop-line is not a recommendation.
It is a hard disengagement rule.

Stop-lines must:
- Be independent of AI confidence
- Trigger automatically
- Restore full visibility without human approval
- Prioritize safety over noise reduction

If stop-lines cannot be clearly defined,
AI-based alert suppression must not be permitted.

This doctrine establishes non-negotiable
boundaries for suppression in production systems.
