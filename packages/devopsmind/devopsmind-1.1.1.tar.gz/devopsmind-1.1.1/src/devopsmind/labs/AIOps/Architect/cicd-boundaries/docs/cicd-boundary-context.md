# CI/CD Boundaries Context

CI/CD pipelines translate decisions into production state
with minimal delay and broad reach.

At platform scale:
- A single pipeline decision can affect many systems
- Failures propagate faster than human intervention
- Rollback may not fully undo impact

In this scenario:
- AI systems are increasingly present in CI/CD activities
- Influence spans multiple pipeline stages
- No platform-wide boundaries define where AI influence must stop

As pipelines evolve:
- Blast radius increases with automation
- Accountability for propagated change becomes harder to trace
- Governance decisions made today will shape future pipelines

The platform remains operational.
No unified AI boundary for CI/CD exists.
