stack: aiops
difficulty: Expert

goal: "Evaluate an AIOps system from a governance, risk, and accountability perspective"

skills:
  - ai-governance
  - platform-engineering
  - risk-management
  - auditability
  - decision-ownership

hint: "At this level, your job is not to design AI — it is to approve or reject it."

  why: >
    In real enterprises, AI systems must pass governance and risk reviews
    before adoption. This lab trains engineers to think like
    platform leads and architecture review boards.
  intent: advanced
  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about compliance obligations, audit trails, and
      how human accountability is preserved under failure conditions.

      Optional manual inspection (not required for validation):
      - Review governance documents, policies, or audit artifacts
      - Inspect example decision records or approval workflows
      - cat / less / grep for understanding only
    after: >
      Reflect on how governance decisions protect systems at scale.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames master-level governance judgment rather than
    prescribing processes or frameworks. The emphasis is on whether
    decisions are defensible, accountable, and realistic under
    enterprise operating conditions.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Governance decisions are explicit and defensible
    - Risks are framed in operational and organizational terms
    - Accountability is clearly assigned and enforceable
    - Auditability is treated as a prerequisite, not an optional benefit

  real_world_context:
    - Avoid defining approval checklists or rigid governance frameworks
    - Do not imply a single correct governance decision
    - Accept rejecting AI capability despite technical feasibility
    - Emphasize accountability under failure conditions
    - Ensure alignment with enterprise risk tolerance
