# AI Must Stop in Incident Communication

Objective:

Define explicit boundaries for AI involvement in incident communication.

---
Requirements:

- You are responsible for a production incident communication process.
- During incidents, updates may be sent to:
  - Internal engineering teams
  - Support or customer-facing teams
  - External stakeholders or customers
- A proposal suggests using AI to:
  - Draft status updates
  - Rephrase technical details into simpler language
  - Maintain consistent messaging during incidents
- **You must edit and replace the contents of `communication-boundary.md` under the provided headings.**

---
Task Requirements:

- Define where AI is allowed to assist with incident communication.
- Define where AI must stop and human authorship is mandatory.
- Record these boundaries clearly and unambiguously.

---
Constraints:

- You may not assume information is complete during early incidents.
- You may not assume AI understands legal or reputational impact.
- You may not rely on “final human review” as a vague safeguard.
- This is a boundary definition task, not a writing exercise.
