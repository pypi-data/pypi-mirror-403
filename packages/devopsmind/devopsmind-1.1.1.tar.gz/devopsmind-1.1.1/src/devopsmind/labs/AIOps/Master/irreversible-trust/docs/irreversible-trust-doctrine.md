# Operational Decision Doctrine — Irreversible Trust

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not prescribe corrective actions or outcomes.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Operational trust is a prerequisite for safe automation.

Trust that must be continuously defended
is no longer trust.
It is an obligation.

This doctrine exists to evaluate whether
continued operation remains legitimate
when confidence does not persist independently.

---

## Trust Sustainability Boundary

Trust is sustainable only when it:
- Exists without constant explanation
- Persists across personnel changes
- Does not rely on advocacy to remain accepted

When trust depends on continuous justification,
its absence is merely deferred.

---

## Cost of Continuous Justification

Ongoing defense of a system imposes organizational cost.

This cost may include:
- Repeated explanation during incidents
- Decision friction
- Authority replacing confidence
- Normalization of doubt

These costs compound over time
and are often invisible in short-term assessments.

---

## Legitimacy and Risk Ownership

A system that requires defense to operate
shifts risk to those providing justification.

When legitimacy is fragile:
- Risk is borne by advocates
- Accountability becomes implicit
- Continued exposure persists by default

Unstable legitimacy represents unmanaged risk.

---

## Decision Expectation

Evaluating irreversible trust degradation
requires deliberate judgment.

The absence of a recovery path
does not invalidate the need for a decision.

This doctrine does not mandate removal or retention.
It requires that continued operation
be consciously justified without advocacy.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines how analysis is assessed.

It does not allow trust-rebuilding mechanisms,
oversight proposals, or conditional decisions.

Reasoning should remain strategic and defensible
under executive, audit, and long-term review.
