  - ai-risk-control

hint:

  - Missed escalation is worse than noisy escalation.

  why: "This lab trains engineers to define where AI must not influence authority transfer during incidents."
  intent: boundary

  guidance:
    before: |
      Incident escalation determines who is paged,
      who owns the incident, and who has authority to act.

      Allowing AI to influence escalation without clear limits
      risks silent failures and unclear responsibility.
      Your task is to define where AI involvement must stop.

    after: |
      Authority must always be traceable to a human decision.
      Escalation boundaries protect accountability.
