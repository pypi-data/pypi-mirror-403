# AI False Negative Context

In some operational environments, AI systems are used
to detect incident conditions and raise alerts.

In production use:
- AI systems may fail to surface real conditions
- Absence of alerts may influence human assumptions
- Human responders retain responsibility for system health

In the lab scenario represented here:
- An AI system was used for incident detection
- No alert or signal was produced during an incident
- Human responders retained the ability to investigate independently

This document provides environmental context only.
It does not describe causes, responsibility, or correct actions.
