  why: "This lab trains engineers to define where AI-generated communication becomes unsafe or unacceptable."
  intent: boundary

  guidance:
    before: |
      Incident communication often begins before root cause is known.
      Messages sent early can shape customer trust, internal confidence,
      and external perception long after the incident ends.

      Allowing AI to generate or modify messages without limits
      risks misrepresentation, premature conclusions, or false reassurance.
      Your task is to define where AI must not participate.

    after: |
      Silence can be safer than incorrect reassurance.
      Communication boundaries protect trust more than speed.
