# AI Should Draft Incident Postmortems

Objective:

Decide whether an AI system should be used to draft incident postmortems.

---
Requirements:

- You are responsible for a production system with a formal incident process.
- Postmortems are written after significant incidents and are:
  - Shared internally with engineering leadership
  - Reviewed for systemic issues and accountability
  - Sometimes referenced in audits or customer communications
- Engineers report that:
  - Writing postmortems is time-consuming
  - Details can be missed under pressure
- A proposal suggests using AI to:
  - Generate an initial postmortem draft
  - Summarize timelines and impact
  - Reduce the effort required from engineers

---
Task Requirements:

- Decide whether AI should be allowed to draft postmortems.
- Record a clear operational decision.
- Justify your decision based on accountability, ownership, and trust.

---
Constraints:

- You may not assume postmortems are informal documents.
- You may not assume AI-generated narratives are neutral.
- You may not propose review workflows or tooling.
- This is a judgment decision, not a documentation exercise.
