# Assess Risk Introduced by AI-Driven Decision Latency

Objective:

- Analyze the operational risk created when AI-assisted analysis
  delays incident response decisions.
- Evaluate how waiting for AI input affected timing and outcomes.
- Determine accountability and post-incident action.

---
Requirements:

- You must edit and replace the contents of `decision_latency_assessment.md`
  under the provided headings.
- All instructional scaffolding must be removed before validation.

---
Task Requirements:

- Describe the incident timeline and decision points.
- Analyze where AI involvement delayed action.
- Identify moments where earlier human decisions were possible.
- Assess the operational and business impact of latency.
- Decide what must change regarding AI placement in decision flows.

---
Constraints:

- No AI retraining or performance tuning.
- No workflow redesign or parallelization.
- No tooling or automation changes.
- Offline, judgment-based analysis only.
- Do not assign blame to individuals.
