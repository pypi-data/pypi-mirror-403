title: "AI Should Deduplicate Production Alerts"
stack: aiops
difficulty: Easy
xp: 50
goal: "Evaluate whether AI-based alert deduplication is acceptable in a production monitoring system"

skills:
  - alerting-judgment
  - situational-awareness
  - operational-risk

hint:
  - Alert volume is not the same as alert severity.
  - Consider what operators no longer see when alerts are merged.

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "This lab trains engineers to judge whether reducing alert volume with AI risks hiding operational reality."
  intent: judgment

  guidance:
    before: |
      Alerting systems are designed to expose system behavior under stress.
      Deduplication can reduce noise, but it can also collapse distinct signals
      into a simplified view that hides emerging or partial failures.

      Before approving AI-driven alert reduction, consider whether
      visibility or comfort is being optimized.

    after: |
      In operations, missing information is often more dangerous than excess information.
      Alert clarity must not come at the cost of situational awareness.
