# Production Logs as Operational Evidence

Production logs are time-ordered records of system behavior.
They often represent the most detailed and authoritative
account of what occurred during normal operation and failures.

Logs are used for:
- Debugging and root cause analysis
- Incident reconstruction
- Postmortems
- Security investigations
- Compliance and audit reviews

In this lab scenario:
- Log volume is high during incidents
- AI is proposed to summarize logs
- Summaries may replace direct inspection of raw data

This document provides context only.
It does not recommend approving or rejecting AI summarization.
