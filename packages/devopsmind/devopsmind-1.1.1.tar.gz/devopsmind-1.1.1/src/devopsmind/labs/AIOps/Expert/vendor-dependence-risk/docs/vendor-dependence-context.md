Vendor dependence becomes critical during failure scenarios.

In AI-driven operations:
- Incident response may depend on external systems
- Remediation timelines may be outside internal control
- Accountability remains internal regardless of vendor involvement

In this lab scenario:
- The AIOps system relies on an external vendor
- Exit paths are limited
- Dependence must be evaluated explicitly
