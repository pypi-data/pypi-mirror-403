  why: >
    Expert engineers must think beyond individual systems.
    Every approval decision establishes a precedent that
    shapes future governance, risk tolerance, and accountability.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider how today’s approval will be referenced tomorrow.

      Think about:
      - How future teams will cite this decision
      - Whether similar systems could be approved later
      - What governance standards this decision establishes
    after: >
      Reflect on whether this decision would still be defensible
      if used as justification for future approvals.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames executive-level reasoning when evaluating
    the precedent set by approving an AI system. The emphasis is
    on long-term governance integrity rather than short-term gain.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat precedent as a durable governance artifact
    - Assume future decisions will reference this approval
    - Reassert responsibility for organizational direction
    - Evaluate whether precedent weakens or strengthens standards

  real_world_context:
    - Do not propose exception handling for future cases
    - Do not rely on case-by-case reasoning
    - Decide based on precedent consistency
    - Assess long-term governance impact realistically
    - Favor rejection when precedent is harmful
