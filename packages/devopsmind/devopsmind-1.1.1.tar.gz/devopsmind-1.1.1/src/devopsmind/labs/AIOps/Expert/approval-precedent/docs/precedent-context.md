# Organizational Precedent Context

In large organizations, governance decisions accumulate.

An approval granted today often becomes justification tomorrow.
Over time, individual decisions form an implicit governance baseline.

## Why Precedent Matters
- Teams reference past approvals to justify new systems
- Standards shift gradually, not explicitly
- Risk tolerance expands through repetition, not intent

## Real-World Effects
- “This was approved before” becomes a governance argument
- Accountability blurs as precedent compounds
- Reversing precedent is harder than rejecting initially

## Common Failure Mode
Organizations approve systems based on immediate benefit
without considering how the decision will be reused in the future.
