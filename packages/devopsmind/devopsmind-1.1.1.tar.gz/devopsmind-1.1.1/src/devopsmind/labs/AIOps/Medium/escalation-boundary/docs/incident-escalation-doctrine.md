# Incident Escalation and Authority

Incident escalation determines who is responsible
for handling an incident at any given moment.

## Why Escalation Is Sensitive

- It interrupts people and teams
- It signals severity across the organization

## Why Teams Consider AI Assistance
- Faster recognition of serious incidents
- Reduced hesitation during escalation
- Support for less-experienced responders

## Known Operational Risks
- Failure to escalate when required
- Over-escalation causing fatigue
- Unclear ownership of escalation decisions
- AI influence masking human accountability
