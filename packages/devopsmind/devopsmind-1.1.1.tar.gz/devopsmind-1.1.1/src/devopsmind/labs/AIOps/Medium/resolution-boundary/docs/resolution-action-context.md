Incident resolution actions modify live systems
during active failures.

## Common Resolution Actions

- Rollbacks to previous versions
- Traffic rerouting or shedding
- Feature disabling or configuration changes

## Why Teams Consider AI Assistance
- Faster identification of potential mitigations
- Reduced hesitation under pressure
- Support for less-experienced responders

## Known Operational Risks
- Incorrect actions amplifying incident impact
- Cascading failures triggered by automation
- Loss of situational awareness during execution
- Unclear accountability for action outcomes
