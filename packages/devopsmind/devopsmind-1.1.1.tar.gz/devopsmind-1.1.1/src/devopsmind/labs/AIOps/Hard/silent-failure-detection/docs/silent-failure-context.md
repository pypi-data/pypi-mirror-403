# Silent AI Failure Context

In some operational environments, AI systems are relied upon
to surface incident conditions or warnings.

In production use:
- AI systems may fail without producing signals
- Absence of alerts may influence human assumptions
- Human responders retain responsibility for awareness and action

In the lab scenario represented here:
- An AI system was used during production operations
- No explicit warnings or signals were produced
- Human responders retained the ability to investigate independently

This document provides environmental context only.
It does not describe causes, responsibility, or correct actions.
