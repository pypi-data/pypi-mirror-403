# Risk Acceptance Context

Risk acceptance is a formal organizational decision
to tolerate known exposure.

Once accepted:
- accountability is fixed
- consequences are owned
- future incidents reference the decision

Risk acceptance does not reduce risk.
It acknowledges and owns it.

In this scenario:
- risks are known
- mitigation is not required
- acceptance must be explicitly decided

This document provides context only.
It does not recommend acceptance or rejection.
