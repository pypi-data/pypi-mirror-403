# Moral Hazard Context

In some operational environments, automation alters
how humans perceive risk and responsibility.

After deployment of automated systems:
- Certain safeguards appear implicit
- Human decision-makers may act more aggressively
- Responsibility for outcomes may feel displaced

In this scenario:
- An AIOps system is active in production environments
- Human operators rely on the system during decision-making
- Risk-taking behavior increased after the system was introduced

Engineers report that:
- Decisions are made with less hesitation
- Failures are assumed to be caught by automation
- Responsibility feels shared with the system

The system remains operational.
No formal decision has been made regarding continued use.
