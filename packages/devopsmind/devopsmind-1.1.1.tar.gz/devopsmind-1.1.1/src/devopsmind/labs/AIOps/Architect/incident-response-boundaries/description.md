# Define Platform-Wide AI Boundaries in Incident Response

Objective:

- Define where AI is allowed and disallowed within incident response.
- Treat incident response as a human-accountability domain.
- Issue boundaries that constrain automated influence during failure.

---
Requirements:

- You must edit and replace the contents of `incident_response_boundary_review.md`
  under the provided headings.
- All placeholder guidance must be removed before validation.

---
Task Requirements:

- Assess incident response phases where AI introduces unacceptable risk.
- Identify phases where AI must never operate.
- Define phases where AI may be permitted with explicit human ownership.
- Justify boundaries under executive and regulatory scrutiny.

---
Constraints:

- No tooling, implementation, or automation design.
- No mitigation, safeguards, or approval workflows.
- No system-level evaluation.
- No conditional or temporary boundaries.
- Offline, judgment-based decision only.
