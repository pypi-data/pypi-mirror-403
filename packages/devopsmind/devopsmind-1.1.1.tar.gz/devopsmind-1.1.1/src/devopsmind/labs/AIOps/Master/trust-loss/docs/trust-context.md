# Trust Loss Context

In some operational environments, trust in automation
degrades gradually rather than collapsing after a single failure.

In this scenario:
- An AIOps system remains technically functional
- Its recommendations are increasingly questioned or bypassed
- Operators no longer rely on outputs without verification

Observed effects include:
- Manual overrides becoming routine
- Parallel human decision paths emerging
- Informal workarounds replacing reliance on automation

As trust eroded:
- Operational consistency declined
- Accountability for outcomes became ambiguous
- Risk exposure shifted silently to human judgment

The system remains operational.
No formal decision has been made regarding removal or retention.

This document provides situational context only.
It does not imply a preferred outcome.
