# Incident Closure and Operational Finality

Incident closure marks the point at which
an organization considers an incident resolved.

## What Closure Represents
- End of active investigation
- Return to normal operations
- Reduced monitoring and attention
- Transition to post-incident review

## Why Teams Consider AI Assistance
- Faster recognition of recovery signals
- Reduction of prolonged incident handling
- Consistency in closure assessment

## Known Operational Risks
- Premature closure masking lingering issues
- Reduced incentive to investigate root causes
- Loss of accountability for unresolved impact
- False confidence in system stability
