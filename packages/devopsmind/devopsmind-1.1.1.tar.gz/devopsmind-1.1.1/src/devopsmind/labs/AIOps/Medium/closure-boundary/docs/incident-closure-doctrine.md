# Incident Closure Authority Doctrine

Incident closure is a declaration of finality.

When an incident is closed:
- Active investigation ends
- Attention and monitoring are reduced
- Unresolved risk may be implicitly accepted

Because closure alters organizational behavior,
the authority to close an incident is an act of judgment,
not analysis.

AI systems may assist with assessment.
They must never declare resolution or finality.

Any system that ends attention without accountability
creates governance blind spots.

If the boundary between assistance and closure authority
cannot be stated explicitly,
AI involvement in incident closure must not be permitted.

This doctrine defines non-negotiable limits
for AI participation in incident closure decisions.
