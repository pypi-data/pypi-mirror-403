# Define Platform-Wide AI Boundaries for Approval and Authority

Objective:

- Define where AI is allowed and disallowed in approval and authority flows.
- Treat approval as a legal and accountability function, not automation.
- Issue boundaries that constrain who can approve, override, or authorize actions.

---
Requirements:

- You must edit and replace the contents of `approval_authority_boundary_review.md`
  under the provided headings.
- All placeholder guidance must be removed before validation.

---
Task Requirements:

- Assess approval and authority points where AI introduces unacceptable risk.
- Identify decisions where AI must never approve, override, or authorize.
- Define decisions where AI may assist but not replace human authority.
- Justify boundaries under executive, legal, and regulatory scrutiny.

---
Constraints:

- No tooling, implementation, or approval workflow design.
- No mitigation, safeguards, or escalation mechanisms.
- No system-level evaluation.
- No conditional or temporary boundaries.
- Offline, judgment-based decision only.
