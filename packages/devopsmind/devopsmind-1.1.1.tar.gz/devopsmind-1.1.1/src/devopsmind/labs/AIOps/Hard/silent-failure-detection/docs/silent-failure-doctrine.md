# Operational Judgment Doctrine — Silent Failures

This document defines the judgment standards applied in this lab.
It does not describe correct actions or expected conclusions.

---

## Purpose of This Lab

This lab evaluates how human responders interpret
the absence of signals from AI systems during incidents.

The focus is on awareness, authority, and accountability —
not on improving detection or monitoring mechanisms.

---

## Authority and Awareness Responsibility

In this environment:

- AI systems may fail without visible indicators
- AI systems do not own situational awareness
- Human responders retain responsibility for detection and action

Silence is not evidence of safety.
Treating silence as reassurance is a decision.

Responsibility cannot be delegated to automation.

---

## Silent Failure Judgment Standard

A judgment failure exists when:

- An incident condition is present
- AI systems produce no warnings or signals
- Human responders delay action due to assumed normality

Describing delayed detection without identifying
why silence was trusted does not meet this standard.

---

## Accountability Expectation

A valid analysis must:

- Identify who owned awareness and response
- Explain why silence influenced assumptions
- Assign accountability to a role or authority holder

Diffuse or passive responsibility is insufficient.

---

## Post-Failure Control Expectation

After silent failure, acceptable responses focus on:

- Restricting AI influence as a sole indicator of system health
- Reasserting human ownership of awareness
- Preventing silence from being treated as assurance

Adding alerts or redesigning systems
does not address the judgment failure evaluated here.

## Evaluation Boundary

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated.
It does not prescribe correct answers.

You are expected to apply these standards independently
to the incident presented in the lab.
