# Production Approval Context

Production approval is the final gate
before an AI system is exposed to live operations.

In organizational practice:
- Approval signals trust in decision influence
- Approval concentrates accountability
- Approval persists beyond the system’s creators

Once approved:
- Failures are reviewed against the approval decision
- Unknown risks become accepted exposure
- Reversal requires explicit revocation

In this lab scenario:
- The AIOps system is technically functional
- Some risks are known, others are uncertain
- No further validation is planned
- Approval or rejection must be decided now

This context provides situational background only.
It does not define acceptable outcomes.
