goal: "Decide whether cumulative operational risk from repeated AIOps failures has become unacceptable"

skills:
  - cumulative-risk-analysis
  - systemic-exposure-evaluation
  - governance-decision-making
  - accountability-ownership

hint:
  - Assume individual failures were survivable.
  - Focus on accumulated exposure, not single incidents.

  why: >
    Individual AI failures may be tolerable in isolation.
    Over time, repeated failures can signal systemic risk
    that governance must address explicitly.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider how organizations evaluate patterns over time.

      Think about:
      - When isolated incidents become a trend
      - How tolerance erodes with repetition
      - Who owns the decision to stop exposure
    after: >
      Reflect on whether continued tolerance becomes negligence.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames executive-level reasoning when evaluating
    whether cumulative risk from repeated AI failures has crossed
    an unacceptable threshold. The emphasis is on systemic exposure
    rather than individual incident severity.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat repeated failure as a governance signal
    - Assume patterns matter more than single outcomes
    - Reassert accountability for continued exposure
    - Evaluate whether tolerance remains defensible

  real_world_context:
    - Do not propose mitigation or improvement plans
    - Do not reset risk counters or timelines
    - Decide using historical outcomes as-is
    - Assess organizational exposure realistically
    - Favor cessation when patterns persist
