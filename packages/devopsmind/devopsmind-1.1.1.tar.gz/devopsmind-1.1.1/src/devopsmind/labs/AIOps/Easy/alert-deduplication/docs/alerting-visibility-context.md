# Alert Deduplication and Operational Visibility

Alert deduplication reduces alert volume by grouping,
merging, or suppressing alerts that appear similar.

Teams often consider deduplication due to:
- High alert volume during incidents
- On-call fatigue
- Difficulty identifying primary failures

However, alerts represent:
- Independent symptoms of system behavior
- Early indicators of cascading failures
- Signals from different components under stress

In this lab scenario:
- Alert volume increases during incidents
- AI is proposed to reduce visible alerts
- Operators must decide whether reduced visibility
  introduces unacceptable operational risk
