  intent: boundary

  guidance:
    before: |
      Change approval is an explicit act of risk acceptance.
      It authorizes modifications to live systems
      and commits the organization to potential outcomes.

      Allowing AI to influence approval without clear limits
      risks unowned consequences.
      Your task is to define where AI involvement must stop.

    after: |
      Risk accepted without authority is risk unowned.
