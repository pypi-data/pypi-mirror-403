# Platform Boundaries Context

Platform boundaries define how risk is allowed to enter an organization.

As AI adoption expands:
- Decisions made today propagate to future systems
- Local choices become organizational defaults
- Boundary gaps scale faster than controls

In this scenario:
- AI usage is increasing across multiple domains
- No platform-wide boundaries constrain future adoption
- Individual teams define limits independently

Over time:
- Inconsistent boundaries increase systemic risk
- Failures become harder to attribute
- Governance decisions are challenged retrospectively

The platform remains operational.
No authoritative boundary framework exists.

This document provides situational context only.
It does not imply correct or preferred boundaries.
