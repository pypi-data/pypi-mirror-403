# Architectural Governance Doctrine — Incident Response Boundaries

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not describe incident response procedures or tooling.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Incident response is a human accountability domain.

This doctrine exists to ensure that
AI systems do not displace responsibility
during moments of organizational failure.

During incidents:
- Decisions commit the organization
- Accountability is established retroactively
- Authority must be defensible after harm occurs

---

## Incident Response as an Accountability Domain

Incident response is not optimization.
It is judgment under failure.

When systems fail:
- Responsibility must remain attributable
- Decisions must be defensible after the fact
- Ownership must not dissolve under speed pressure

AI may influence information,
but it must not become the decision owner.

---

## AI Influence Boundary

AI assistance does not equal authority.

AI may support:
- Information aggregation
- Context summarization
- Signal surfacing

AI must never:
- Decide incident severity
- Direct irreversible response actions
- Override human judgment during failure

The boundary is not technical.
It is accountability-based.

---

## Disallowed Incident Response Domains

Certain phases require exclusive human authority:

- Decisions that escalate impact
- Actions that widen blast radius
- Judgments that assign responsibility
- Choices that commit recovery paths

In these domains, AI influence must be permanently excluded.

---

## Permitted Incident Response Support Domains

AI may assist where:
- A human explicitly owns the decision
- Responsibility remains attributable
- Actions remain reversible or advisory

Assistance must never replace judgment.

---

## Governance Expectation

Architect-level boundaries must:
- Be platform-wide
- Remain valid under pressure
- Survive post-incident review
- Withstand regulatory and legal scrutiny

Ambiguity during incidents
creates institutional risk.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines evaluation standards.

It does not allow:
- Procedural incident playbooks
- Workflow descriptions
- Automation design

Reasoning must remain architectural,
defensible, and ownership-centric.
