# Incident Postmortem Authorship Doctrine

Incident postmortems are official records of failure.

They establish:
- What happened
- Why it happened
- Who owns the outcome
- What the organization accepts responsibility for

Authorship matters.

Whoever drafts the postmortem:
- Shapes the narrative of failure
- Influences perceived accountability
- Determines what is emphasized or omitted

Postmortems may be used beyond engineering:
- Leadership review
- Compliance and audits
- Customer communication
- Legal or contractual review

This lab evaluates whether authorship of failure
can be delegated without weakening accountability.
