# Assess Risk of Silent AI Failure in Production Operations

Objective:

- Analyze the operational risk created when an AIOps system fails silently.
- Evaluate how lack of AI signals influenced human awareness and response.
- Determine accountability and post-incident action after delayed detection.

Requirements:

- You must edit and replace the contents of `silent_failure_assessment.md` under the provided headings.
- All instructional scaffolding must be removed before validation.

---
Task Requirements:

- Describe the incident and how the failure remained undetected.
- Analyze how AI silence influenced human assumptions.
- Identify where human judgment should have intervened.
- Assess the operational and business impact of delayed awareness.
- Decide what must be done regarding this AI system post-incident.
