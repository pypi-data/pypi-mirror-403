# AI Must Stop in Incident Triage

Objective

Define explicit boundaries for AI involvement in production incident triage.

---
Requirements:

- You own a production incident response process.
- Incident triage currently includes:
  - Identifying the affected service
  - Assigning initial severity
  - Paging or escalating responders
- An AI system has been proposed to assist with triage by:
  - Grouping alerts
  - Suggesting incident categories
  - Recommending severity levels
- **You must edit and replace the contents of `change-approval-boundary.md` under the provided headings.**

---
Task Requirements:

- Define where AI is allowed to participate in triage.
- Define where AI must stop and hand control to humans.
- Record these boundaries clearly and unambiguously.

---
Constraints:

- You may not assume AI decisions are always reviewed.
- You may not rely on “human oversight” as a vague control.
- You may not design triage systems or tools.
- This is a boundary definition task, not an implementation task.
