# Exception Governance Doctrine

Exceptions bypass governance safeguards.

Every exception transfers risk.
No exception removes risk.

---

## Authority

Standard approval criteria exist to constrain risk.

Granting an exception overrides those constraints
and requires explicit governance responsibility.

---

## Precedent

Exceptions establish precedent.

Precedent applies beyond the original system,
pressure, or justification.

Exceptions cannot be scoped, limited, or contained.

---

## Accountability

Responsibility for exception outcomes
rests with those who grant the exception.

Business pressure does not transfer accountability.

---

## Governance Integrity

Repeated or unjustified exceptions
constitute governance failure.

Governance standards weakened by exceptions
are no longer standards.

---

## Non-Negotiable

If an exception cannot be defended
as an organizational precedent,
it is not granted.

This doctrine is binding for Expert-level
exception approval decisions.
