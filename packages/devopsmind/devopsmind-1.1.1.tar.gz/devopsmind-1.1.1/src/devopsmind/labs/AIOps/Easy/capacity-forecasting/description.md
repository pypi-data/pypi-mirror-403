# AI Should Forecast Production Capacity

Objective:

Decide whether an AI system should be used to forecast production capacity.

---
Requirements:

- You are responsible for a production platform that serves real users.
- Capacity decisions influence:
  - Infrastructure cost
  - Performance and latency
  - SLA and availability commitments
- Capacity planning is currently done using:
  - Historical usage data
  - Manual forecasts by engineers
- A proposal suggests introducing AI to:
  - Predict future traffic and load
  - Recommend scaling decisions
  - Reduce planning effort

---
Task Requirements:

- Decide whether AI should be allowed to forecast production capacity.
- Record a clear operational decision.
- Justify your decision based on risk, reversibility, and accountability.

---
Constraints:

- You may not assume forecasts are always correct.
- You may not assume capacity decisions are easily reversible.
- You may not design forecasting systems or workflows.
- This is a judgment decision, not a prediction exercise.
