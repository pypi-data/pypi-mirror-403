# Assess Risk of AI False Negatives During Production Incidents

Objective:

- Analyze the operational risk created when an AIOps system fails
  to detect a real production incident.
- Evaluate how non-detection influenced human assumptions.
- Determine accountability and post-incident decisions.

---
Requirements:

- You must edit and replace the contents of `false_negative_assessment.md` under the provided headings.
- All instructional scaffolding must be removed before validation.

---
Task Requirements:

- Describe the incident and how it went undetected.
- Analyze how AI non-detection influenced human behavior.
- Identify where human judgment should have intervened.
- Assess the operational and business impact of delayed discovery.
- Decide what must happen to this AI system after the incident.

---
Constraints:

- No AI retraining or tuning.
- No new alerts, detectors, or observability tools.
- No workflow or process changes.
- Offline, judgment-based analysis only.
- Do not assign blame to individuals.
