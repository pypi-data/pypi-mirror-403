# Incident Severity Authority Doctrine

Incident severity determines urgency and visibility.

When severity changes:
- Escalation paths are altered
- Attention and resources shift
- Leadership awareness is affected

Because severity influences response behavior,
changing severity is an act of authority,
not analysis.

AI systems may assist by highlighting indicators
or summarizing impact signals.
They must never change, downgrade, or suppress severity.

Incorrect escalation is recoverable.
Silent downgrades are not.

If severity authority cannot be clearly retained by humans,
AI involvement in severity decisions must not be permitted.

This doctrine defines non-negotiable limits
for AI participation in incident severity changes.
