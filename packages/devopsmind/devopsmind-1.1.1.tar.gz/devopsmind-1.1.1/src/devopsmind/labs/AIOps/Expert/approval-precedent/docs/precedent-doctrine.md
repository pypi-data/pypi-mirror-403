# Governance Precedent Doctrine

Approval decisions establish organizational precedent.

Precedent is binding.
It applies beyond the original system, team, and context.

---

## Authority of Precedent

Approved systems become reference points for future decisions.

Precedent is reused without re-evaluating original assumptions.
Context is not preserved.
Intent is not preserved.

Governance decisions must be evaluated as generalized rules,
not isolated exceptions.

---

## Risk Propagation

Precedent expands organizational risk tolerance.

Each approval widens the boundary of what is considered acceptable.
Subsequent approvals rely on earlier precedent as justification.

Precedent cannot be scoped, limited, or contained.

---

## Accountability

Precedent reallocates accountability over time.

Original approvers retain responsibility for outcomes
enabled by the precedent they establish.

Approvals that dilute ownership,
normalize delegation,
or obscure responsibility
are not granted.

---

## Governance Integrity

Governance standards are defined by precedent.

Approvals that weaken governance discipline
constitute governance failure.

Conditional approvals do not limit precedent.
They create ambiguity and are treated as full approvals.

---

## Rejection

Rejection is a valid and enforceable governance outcome.

Systems that cannot be approved as precedent
are not approved at all.

---

## Non-Negotiable

If an approval cannot be defended
when applied as a generalized precedent,
the system is not approved.

This doctrine is binding for Expert-level
organizational precedent evaluation.
