# Decide Removal of an AIOps System After Incident Amplification

Objective:

- Decide whether a live AIOps system must be permanently removed
  after it amplified the impact of operational incidents.
- Treat amplification as a systemic failure, not an anomaly.
- Issue a decision that remains valid after post-incident review.

Requirements:

- You must edit and replace the contents of `incident_amplification_review.md`
  under the provided headings.
- All placeholder guidance must be removed before validation.

---
Task Requirements:

- Assess how the system influenced incident severity or spread.
- Evaluate whether automation increased blast radius.
- Identify who owns consequences of amplified impact.
