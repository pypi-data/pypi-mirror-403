# Incident Amplification Context

In some operational environments, automation is introduced
to accelerate response, coordination, or decision-making
during incidents.

After deployment:
- Certain incidents resolved faster
- Others escalated more quickly than before
- Automation influenced how failures propagated

In this scenario:
- An AIOps system was active during multiple incidents
- The system did not initiate failures
- Its involvement increased speed, scope, or spread of impact

Engineers observed that:
- Human intervention windows narrowed
- Localized issues escalated more rapidly
- Blast radius expanded compared to pre-automation behavior

The system remains operational.
No formal decision has been made regarding continued use.

This document provides situational context only.
It does not imply a preferred outcome.
