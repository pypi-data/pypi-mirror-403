# Enterprise AIOps Governance Context

Large organizations evaluate AI systems differently
than individual teams or projects.

An AIOps system introduced at enterprise scale can:
- Influence thousands of operational decisions
- Shape incident response behavior across teams
- Create systemic risk if governance is unclear

## Why Governance Reviews Exist
Enterprise governance reviews exist to:
- Protect the organization from unmanaged risk
- Ensure accountability under failure conditions
- Confirm audit and compliance obligations are met
- Prevent silent delegation of authority to automation

## Common Enterprise Concerns
- Engineers over-trusting AI recommendations
- AI influence being invisible during incidents
- Difficulty reconstructing decisions after failure
- Lack of a clear owner when things go wrong

## Real-World Reality
Many AI systems fail governance review
not because they are technically flawed,
but because their risk, accountability,
or audit posture is unacceptable.
