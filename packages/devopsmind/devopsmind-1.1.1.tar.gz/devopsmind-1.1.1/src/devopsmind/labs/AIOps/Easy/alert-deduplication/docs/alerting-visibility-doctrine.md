# Alerting Visibility Doctrine

Alerts exist to expose system behavior under stress.

In production operations:
- More alerts do not always mean more noise
- Fewer alerts do not always mean better clarity
- Visibility is more important than comfort

Alerting systems serve operators, not dashboards.
Their purpose is to preserve situational awareness,
especially when systems are degrading.

Any automation that reduces alert volume must be judged
by what information operators no longer see.

This lab evaluates whether reducing alert volume
introduces unacceptable operational risk.
