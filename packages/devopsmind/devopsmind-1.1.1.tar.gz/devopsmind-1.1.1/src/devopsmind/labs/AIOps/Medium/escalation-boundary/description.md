# AI Must Stop in Incident Escalation

Objective:

Define explicit boundaries for AI involvement in incident escalation.

---
Requirements:

Define explicit boundaries that separate:
- Where AI may assist in assessing escalation signals
- Where AI must not participate and human authority is mandatory

Your boundaries must be clear at the point responsibility is transferred.
- **You must edit and replace the contents of `escalation-boundary.md` under the provided headings.**

---
Task Requirements:

- Define where AI may assist with escalation decisions.
- Define where AI must stop and human authority is mandatory.
- Record these boundaries clearly and unambiguously.

---
Constraints:

- You may not assume escalation mistakes are easily corrected.
- You may not rely on “manual review” as a safeguard.
- You may not design escalation systems or tooling.
- This is a boundary definition task, not a process design exercise.
