# Auditability Context

Auditability determines whether decisions can be examined,
explained, and defended after the fact.

In operational environments:
- incidents are reviewed months later
- personnel change
- intent is insufficient without evidence

AI-influenced decisions introduce opacity
that may complicate reconstruction and accountability.

In this scenario:
- AI influenced operational decisions
- decision records are incomplete
- audit exposure must be assessed
