# Incident Classification Context

Incident classification determines the nature and urgency
of a production issue so that the correct response path is triggered.

Classification affects:
- Paging urgency and escalation paths
- Responder ownership
- Stakeholder and customer communication
- Post-incident accountability

In this lab scenario:
- Incidents are currently classified by humans
- AI is proposed to classify incidents automatically
- Classification errors may suppress escalation or urgency

This document provides context only.
It does not recommend approving or rejecting automation.
