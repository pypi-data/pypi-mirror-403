# Go / No-Go Governance Doctrine

Production release is irreversible exposure.

Once released, risk is realized by the organization,
not the system.

---

## Authority

Go/no-go decisions are governance decisions.

Technical readiness does not require release.
Business pressure does not compel release.

---

## Uncertainty

Unknown failure modes are assumed to exist at release time.

Uncertainty is not reduced by optimism.

Releasing under uncertainty is an explicit acceptance of risk.

---

## Accountability

Responsibility for release outcomes
rests with those who authorize release.

Responsibility persists after failure.

---

## Governance Discipline

Delaying or denying release is a valid outcome.

Shipping uncertainty that cannot be defended
constitutes governance failure.

---

## Non-Negotiable

If a release decision cannot be defended
after a severe production failure,
the release does not proceed.

This doctrine is binding for Expert-level
go/no-go release decisions.
