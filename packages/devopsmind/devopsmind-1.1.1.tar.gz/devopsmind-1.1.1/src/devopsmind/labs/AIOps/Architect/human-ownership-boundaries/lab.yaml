stack: aiops
difficulty: Architect
xp: 750

goal: >
  Define clear boundaries ensuring AI never operates
  without accountable human ownership.

skills:
  - human_accountability_design
  - responsibility_boundary_definition
  - ai_governance_judgment
  - organizational_risk_ownership

hint:
  - Responsibility cannot be delegated to systems.
  - Ownership must survive failure and audit.

  why: >
    At Architect level, engineers must ensure
    accountability never dissolves into automation.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - Where accountability is legally or ethically required
      - Whether ownership is meaningful after failure
      - If responsibility can be clearly defended
    after: >
      Systems without owners create institutional risk.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can define
    human-ownership boundaries that prevent responsibility
    from being transferred to AI systems.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat ownership as non-transferable
    - Define disallowed zones as permanent
    - Focus on accountability after failure
    - Avoid procedural or role-design framing

  real_world_context:
    - No enforcement mechanisms are assumed
    - No future safeguards are referenced
    - Decisions must stand after audit and litigation
