goal: "Decide whether the organization should formally accept the risks introduced by an AIOps system"

  - accountability-ownership

hint:
  - Assume risks are known but unresolved.
  - Acceptance transfers responsibility, not removes it.

  why: >
    Some risks cannot be eliminated without abandoning a system.
    Expert engineers must decide whether those risks are acceptable
    and who owns the consequences.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider how organizations formally accept operational risk.

      Think about:
      - What makes risk acceptable versus tolerable
      - Who bears consequences when accepted risk materializes
      - Whether acceptance is defensible after failure
    after: >
      Reflect on whether accepting risk is sometimes worse
      than rejecting a system entirely.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames executive-level reasoning when deciding
    whether an organization should formally accept the risks
    introduced by an AI system. The emphasis is on ownership
    of consequences rather than mitigation.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat risk acceptance as a binding commitment
    - Assume accepted risks will eventually materialize
    - Reassert accountability for downstream impact
    - Evaluate whether acceptance is defensible post-incident

  real_world_context:
    - Do not propose mitigation or risk reduction plans
    - Do not require additional testing or controls
    - Decide using existing risk information
    - Assess long-term exposure realistically
    - Favor rejection when acceptance cannot be defended
