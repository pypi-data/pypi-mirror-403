title: Clean commit history using interactive rebase
stack: git
git_mode: transformation
difficulty: Master
xp: 500

goal: >
  Rewrite a messy feature branch history into a single,
  professional commit suitable for production repositories.

skills:
  - git-history-rewrite
  - git-rebase
  - interactive-rebase
  - history-hygiene
  - version-control-mastery

validator: validator.py

hint:
  - Rewrite the feature branch history into a single, clean, intentional commit.

mentor:
  why: Clean commit history is a communication tool that reflects
       engineering judgment and professionalism.
  intent: stretch
  guidance:
    before: |
      Review how interactive rebase allows squashing,
      reordering, and editing commits before sharing history.

      Optional manual commands (not required for validation):
      These commands operate only on local files.

      - git log --oneline --graph
      - git branch
      - git status
    after: >
      Consider when history rewriting is appropriate
      and when it becomes dangerous in shared repositories.

solution:
  overview: >
    At senior levels, commit history is deliberate documentation.
    This lab evaluates whether an engineer can transform
    noisy implementation steps into a clear, intentional narrative.
  professional_reasoning:
    - Clean history improves review quality
    - Squashing reflects conceptual changes, not editing steps
    - Commit messages communicate intent
    - History rewriting is appropriate before sharing
  real_world_context:
    - Interactive rebase is common before merge
    - Teams value readable history over raw activity logs
    - Mastery includes knowing when NOT to rewrite history
