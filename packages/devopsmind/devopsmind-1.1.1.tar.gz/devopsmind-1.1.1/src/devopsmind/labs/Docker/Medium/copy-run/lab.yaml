title: Dockerfile that Copies a Local Script and Runs It
stack: docker
domain: container
difficulty: Medium
xp: 100

goal: >
  Build a Docker image that copies application code
  into the image and runs it at container startup.

skills:
  - dockerfile-authoring
  - image-build-process
  - container-execution

validator: validator.py

hint:
  - Dockerfile must COPY app.py and set CMD to run python3 app.py.

mentor:
  why: This lab demonstrates how application code is packaged
       into a Docker image and executed at runtime, reflecting
       a common real-world container workflow.
  intent: applied
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider how COPY and CMD work together
      during image build and container startup.
    after: >
      Consider how using ENTRYPOINT or reordering Dockerfile
      instructions could affect caching and rebuild time.
