title: "Define Jenkins CI Governance Policy"
stack: jenkins
difficulty: Master
xp: 500
goal: "Define CI governance rules based on failures, constraints, and organizational context."

skills:
  - ci-governance
  - risk-management
  - engineering-judgment

hint: "Policies must balance safety, delivery velocity, and long-term maintainability."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "CI systems fail at scale when governance, ownership, and review standards are undefined or unclear."
  intent: judgment

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how governance decisions shape engineering behavior and failure patterns across an organization.
    after: |
      Consider how effective governance enables teams to move quickly without introducing systemic risk.

solution:
  overview: >
    At master level, CI governance is an exercise in engineering judgment rather
    than tooling. This lab evaluates whether an engineer can define clear,
    enforceable policies that reduce systemic risk while respecting organizational
    constraints and team autonomy.
  professional_reasoning:
    - Governance failures often manifest as ownership gaps
    - Policies must prevent common failure modes without blocking delivery
    - Clear scope and justification improve policy adoption
    - Overly rigid rules can create shadow systems and risk
  real_world_context:
    - CI incidents frequently stem from unreviewed shared changes
    - Mature organizations formalize CI ownership and review boundaries
    - Senior engineers balance autonomy with platform reliability
