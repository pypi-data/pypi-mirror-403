stack: jenkins
difficulty: Expert
xp: 300
goal: "Analyze the system-wide impact of shared Jenkins pipeline logic."

skills:
  - dependency-analysis
  - ci-architecture
  - blast-radius-reduction

hint: "A single shared change can affect multiple independent pipelines."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "CI systems often fail due to hidden coupling introduced by shared pipeline logic and libraries."
  intent: stretch

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how shared Jenkins libraries introduce implicit dependencies between otherwise independent pipelines.
    after: |
      Consider how shared CI components increase blast radius and why senior engineers prioritize isolation over convenience.

  overview: >
    At expert level, CI reliability depends on understanding hidden coupling
    introduced by shared pipeline logic. This lab evaluates whether an
    engineer can reason about blast radius, failure propagation, and containment
    strategies without relying on pipeline execution.
  professional_reasoning:
    - Shared libraries create implicit system-wide dependencies
    - Failures propagate across all consuming pipelines
    - Blast radius analysis requires mapping consumers, not symptoms
    - Containment is more effective than reactive fixes
  real_world_context:
    - Large CI platforms often centralize pipeline logic
    - Shared CI failures commonly block multiple teams simultaneously
    - Mature CI designs favor isolation and explicit boundaries
