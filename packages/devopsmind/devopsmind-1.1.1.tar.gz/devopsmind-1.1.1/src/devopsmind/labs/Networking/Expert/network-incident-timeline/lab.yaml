title: "Reconstruct Network Incident Timeline"
stack: networking
difficulty: Expert
xp: 300
goal: "Reconstruct a network incident timeline by correlating events across multiple log sources"

skills:
  - incident-analysis
  - log-correlation
  - network-forensics

hint: "Correlate timestamps across firewall, DNS, and application logs."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Network incidents are rarely visible in a single data source. Engineers must correlate logs across multiple systems to understand sequence, causality, and impact."
  intent: stretch

  guidance:
    before: |
      Focus on understanding how independent systems generate logs and how time alignment reveals cause-and-effect relationships.
    after: |
      Consider how missing logs, clock skew, or noisy events can complicate real incident timelines.

solution:
  overview: >
    Expert-level incident response requires reconstructing timelines from
    incomplete and distributed evidence. This lab evaluates whether
    an engineer can infer sequence and causality by correlating independent
    network and application signals.
  professional_reasoning:
    - Individual logs show symptoms, not causes
    - Time correlation reveals dependency chains
    - Accurate sequencing is critical for root-cause analysis
    - Analysts must distinguish primary failures from downstream effects
  real_world_context:
    - Network outages often cascade across DNS, firewall, and application layers
    - Incident timelines are central to postmortems and remediation planning
    - Senior engineers are expected to explain *why* events unfolded, not just *what* happened
