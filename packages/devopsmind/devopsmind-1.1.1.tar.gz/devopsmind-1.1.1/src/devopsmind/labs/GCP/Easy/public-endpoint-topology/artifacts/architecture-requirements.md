# GCP Public Web Application – Requirements

The architecture must include:

- A public entry point for HTTP traffic
- A managed load balancing service
- A compute service to run application code
- An object storage service for static assets

Common GCP services used for this pattern include:
- Global HTTP(S) Load Balancer
- Compute Engine
- Cloud Storage
- VPC

The design must reflect a realistic production setup.
