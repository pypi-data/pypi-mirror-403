goal: >
  Perform an evidence-based analysis explaining how identity
  and trust boundary design amplified blast radius during
  a GCP security incident.

  - cloud-security-architecture
  - blast-radius-analysis
  - identity-boundary-reasoning
  - incident-analysis

validator: validator.py

hint: >
  Focus on how shared identity and trust boundaries enabled
  lateral movement after the initial compromise.

mentor:
  why: Security incidents escalate when identity boundaries are weak.
  intent: Teach how architectural identity decisions shape blast radius.
  guidance:
    before: Identify identity, network, and resource trust boundaries.
    after: Explain why the incident spread beyond the initial host.

solution:
  overview: >
    Expert-level security analysis focuses on understanding
    how identity and trust boundaries determine blast radius.
    The goal is not to find exploits, but to explain why
    architectural decisions allowed lateral movement.

  approach:
    - Identify identity, network, and resource boundaries
    - Correlate incident events with boundary design
    - Explain how shared credentials enabled lateral access
    - Trace how trust boundaries failed to contain the incident

  professional_considerations:
    - Shared identities increase blast radius by design
    - Boundary failures are architectural, not operational
    - Evidence must support all conclusions
    - Avoid proposing fixes or enforcement mechanisms
