hint:
  - Strong policy systems constrain risk and cost without blocking teams.

mentor:
  why: Cloud success at scale depends more on governance than services.
  intent: Evaluate principal-level organizational judgment.
  guidance:
    before: Review org structure, cost signals, and constraints.

solution:
  overview: >
    Master-level governance labs evaluate judgment rather than
    correctness. The goal is to articulate a policy system that
    realistically balances autonomy, cost control, and accountability
    under organizational constraints.

  approach:
    - Define clear scope boundaries for governance
    - Assign ownership without centralizing all responsibility
    - Establish cost visibility and accountability principles
    - Introduce guardrails that limit risk without blocking delivery
    - Explicitly acknowledge trade-offs and their consequences

  professional_considerations:
    - Over-governance reduces velocity and drives shadow IT
    - Under-governance externalizes cost and reliability risk
    - Sustainable systems favor transparency over enforcement
    - Trade-offs must be explicit and defensible
