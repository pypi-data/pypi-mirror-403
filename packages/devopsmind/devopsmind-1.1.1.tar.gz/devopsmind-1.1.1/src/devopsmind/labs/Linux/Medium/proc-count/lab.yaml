title: "Count Running Processes"
stack: linux
difficulty: Medium
xp: 100
goal: "Write a Bash script to count and output the number of running processes"

skills:
  - bash-scripting
  - process-management
  - command-pipelines

hint: "Create count_procs.sh that prints only the number of running processes."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Counting and inspecting running processes is a common operational task, and building reliable command pipelines is essential for Linux automation and monitoring."
  intent: applied

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how Linux process listing commands produce output and how that output can be filtered and counted reliably.

      Optional manual commands (not required for validation):
      These commands operate only on local files.
      Results are for personal verification only.

      - ps -e
      - ps aux
      - wc -l
    after: |
      Consider how process counts can change rapidly and why scripts should produce stable, machine-readable output.
