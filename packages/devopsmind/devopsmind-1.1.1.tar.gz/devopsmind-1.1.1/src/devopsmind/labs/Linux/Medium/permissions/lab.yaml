  - linux-permissions

  - file-management

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Correctly managing file permissions is essential for enforcing access control and preventing unintended execution or modification in Linux systems."
  intent: applied

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how Linux represents permissions for owners, groups, and others, and how those permissions affect who can read, write, or execute a file.

      Optional manual commands (not required for validation):
      These commands operate only on local files.
      Results are for personal verification only.

      - stat script.sh
    after: |
      Consider how incorrect permissions can lead to security vulnerabilities or accidental execution by unauthorized users.
