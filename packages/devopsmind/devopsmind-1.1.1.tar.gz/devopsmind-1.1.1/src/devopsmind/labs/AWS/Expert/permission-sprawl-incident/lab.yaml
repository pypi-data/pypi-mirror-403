title: Investigate a Permission Sprawl Incident
stack: aws
domain: security
difficulty: Expert
xp: 300

goal: >
  Perform an evidence-based security analysis explaining how
  identity and trust boundary design amplified blast radius
  during a cloud security incident.

skills:
  - cloud-security-architecture
  - blast-radius-analysis
  - identity-boundary-reasoning
  - incident-analysis

validator: validator.py

hint:
  - Focus on how identity reuse and trust boundaries allowed lateral movement after the initial compromise.

mentor:
  why: >
    Security incidents escalate when identity boundaries are weak
    and permissions are shared across trust domains.
  intent: applied
  guidance:
    before: >
      Identify identity, network, and resource trust boundaries
      based strictly on the provided artifacts.
    after: >
      Your analysis should clearly explain why identity and trust
      boundaries failed to limit blast radius during the incident.

solution:
  overview: >
    Expert-level security analysis focuses on how identity and trust
    boundary design determines blast radius during incidents.
    The goal is to reason about architectural permission scope,
    not individual vulnerabilities or fixes.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Identify the effective identity, network, and resource boundaries
    - Correlate incident events with identity reuse and access scope
    - Trace how shared trust enabled lateral access
    - Explain why the blast radius exceeded a single compromised host

  real_world_context:
    - Avoid speculative or tool-based explanations
    - Preserve strict evidence-to-conclusion traceability
    - Separate initial compromise from blast radius amplification
    - Ensure conclusions are auditable and architecture-driven
