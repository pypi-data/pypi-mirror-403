goal: >
  Evaluate and articulate an enterprise cloud control model,
  balancing cost control, team autonomy, and organizational scale
  using evidence and stated constraints.

skills:
  - cloud-governance-judgment
  - organizational-design
  - cost-governance
  - policy-tradeoff-analysis

validator: validator.py

hint:
  - Strong governance enables teams while constraining failure and cost.
    Weak governance does the opposite.

mentor:
  why: >
    Cloud success at scale depends more on policy and accountability
    than on individual technical controls.
  intent: applied
  guidance:
    before: |
      Review the organizational structure, cost signals,
      and stated governance constraints in the provided artifacts.
    after: >
      Your policy should reflect realistic compromises between
      cost control, autonomy, and operational scalability.

solution:
  overview: >
    Master-level governance judgment evaluates how well a control model
    balances competing organizational forces rather than optimizing
    for any single dimension. The focus is on policy realism,
    accountability clarity, and sustainable scale.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Identify the organizational scope where centralized controls are justified
    - Define ownership boundaries for cost, reliability, and security
    - Articulate cost control principles that do not block delivery
    - Establish guardrails that limit systemic risk without removing autonomy
    - Make explicit trade-offs and justify why they are acceptable

  real_world_context:
    - Avoid tool-centric or enforcement-based thinking
    - Prioritize decision-making clarity over completeness
    - Accept imperfect control in favor of organizational velocity
    - Ensure policies are auditable and understandable at scale
