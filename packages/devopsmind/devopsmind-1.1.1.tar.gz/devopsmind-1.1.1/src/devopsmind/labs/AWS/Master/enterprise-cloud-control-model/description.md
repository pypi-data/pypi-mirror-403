# Judge an Enterprise Cloud Control Model

Objective:
This lab verifies your ability to judge and articulate
an enterprise cloud control model under real organizational
and financial constraints.

At large scale, cloud failures are rarely technical.
They emerge from poorly designed governance models
that either over-control or under-control teams.

Your task is to define a practical control model
that would realistically function in this organization.

---
Requirements:

You must reason strictly from the provided organizational context,
cost signals, and governance constraints.

The materials may conflict with each other and require
explicit trade-offs rather than idealized solutions.

---
Task Requirements:

Edit the local file cloud-governance-policy.md and document:

1. The scope of the control model
2. How ownership and accountability are assigned
3. Core cost governance principles
4. High-level usage guardrails
5. Explicit trade-offs made and why

Your response will be evaluated on judgment, realism,
and trade-off clarity rather than completeness.

---
Constraints:

Do NOT propose tools, scripts, or automation
Do NOT define enforcement mechanisms
Do NOT reference IaC or provisioning
Focus on policy, accountability, and decision-making
Work fully offline and locally
