stack: aws
domain: architecture
difficulty: Easy
xp: 50

goal: >
  Evaluate an existing AWS internet-facing web architecture
  and assess exposure, structure, and request flow.

skills:
  - aws-architecture-review
  - cloud-exposure-awareness
  - request-flow-analysis

validator: "validator.py"

hint: >
  Focus on which components are publicly reachable
  and how traffic enters AWS.

mentor:
  why: >
    Cloud engineers must review architectures before deployment.
    Early exposure analysis prevents security and design flaws
    from reaching production.
  intent: foundation
  guidance:
    before: |
      Identify which components are public-facing and which remain private.
      Think about exposure from an internet and security perspective.
