# AWS Public Web Application – Requirements

The architecture must include:

- A public entry point for HTTP traffic
- A managed load balancing service
- A compute service to run application code
- An object storage service for static assets

Common AWS services used for this pattern include:
- Application Load Balancer
- EC2
- S3
- VPC

The design should reflect a realistic production setup.
