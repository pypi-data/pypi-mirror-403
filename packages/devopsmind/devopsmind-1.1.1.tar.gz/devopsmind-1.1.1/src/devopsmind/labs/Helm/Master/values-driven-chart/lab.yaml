mentor:
  why: "This lab focuses on designing fully configurable Helm charts where behavior and deployment characteristics are driven entirely by values."
  intent: stretch

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about which aspects of a Helm chart should be configurable versus which should remain opinionated defaults.
    after: |
      Consider how a values-driven design enables the same chart to be reused safely across development, staging, and production environments.

solution:
  overview: >
    At master level, Helm charts are treated as reusable products rather than
    one-off deployment artifacts. This lab evaluates whether an engineer
    can design a chart whose behavior is entirely driven by configuration,
    enabling safe reuse across environments without template modification.
  professional_reasoning:
    - Values-driven charts reduce duplication across environments
    - Configuration should control behavior, not template edits
    - Clear value boundaries improve long-term maintainability
    - Excessive templating can reduce chart readability
  real_world_context:
    - Production teams reuse the same chart across multiple clusters
    - Environment-specific behavior is controlled through values files
    - Senior engineers balance flexibility with sensible defaults
