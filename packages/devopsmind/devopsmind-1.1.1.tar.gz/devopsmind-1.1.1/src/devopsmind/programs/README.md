# DevOpsMind Programs

Programs are time-bound, policy-driven DevOpsMind experiences.

They are:
- Offline
- Non-gamified by default
- Isolated from labs and projects
- Driven by system design, simulation, and reasoning

Programs do not:
- Award badges
- Affect streaks
- Modify lab/project state

Examples:
- BuildTrack
- InfraHack
