# Version Control (Git)

This directory represents how changes are tracked
and managed over time.

## Design writing

Document your design thinking in `DESIGN.md`.

Explain how version control fits into your system.

## What you must create

No tool-specific file is required in this directory.

This layer is represented conceptually through
repository structure and change discipline.

## Validation behavior

- Only `DESIGN.md` is validated
- No file-based validation is performed
