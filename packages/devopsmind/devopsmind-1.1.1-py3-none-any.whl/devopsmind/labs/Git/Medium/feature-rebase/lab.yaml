stack: git
git_mode: transformation
difficulty: Medium
xp: 100

goal: >
  Rebase a feature branch cleanly onto the latest main branch
  while preserving a linear Git history.

skills:
  - git-branching
  - git-rebase
  - history-hygiene

validator: validator.py

hint:
  - Ensure the feature branch is rebased cleanly onto the latest

mentor:
  why: Rebasing keeps Git history linear and reviewable,
       which is critical for collaborative development workflows.
  intent: applied
  guidance:
    before: |

      and when each approach is appropriate.

      Optional manual commands (not required for validation):
      These commands operate only on local files.

      - git branch
      - git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
      - git status
    after: >
      Practice resolving conflicts during a rebase to simulate
      real-world collaboration scenarios.
