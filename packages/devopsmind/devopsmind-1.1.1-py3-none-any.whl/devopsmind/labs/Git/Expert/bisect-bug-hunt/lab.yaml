title: Identify bug introduction commit using git bisect
stack: git
git_mode: discovery
difficulty: Expert
xp: 300

goal: >
  Identify the commit that introduced a regression
  using systematic Git history analysis.

skills:
  - git-bisect
  - git-history-analysis
  - debugging
  - regression-analysis

validator: validator.py

hint:
  - Use git bisect to narrow down the commit
    where application behavior changed.

mentor:
  why: Systematic history analysis allows engineers to identify
       regressions quickly without guesswork or blame.
  intent: stretch
  guidance:
    before: |
      Understand how git bisect performs a binary search
      across commit history to isolate regressions.

      Optional manual commands (not required for validation):
      These commands operate only on local files.
      Results are for personal verification only.

      - git log --oneline
      - git bisect start
      - git bisect good
      - git bisect bad
    after: >
      Consider how bisect automation can be used
      in large repositories with test suites.

solution:
  overview: >
    Expert-level debugging relies on evidence, not intuition.
    Git bisect enables logarithmic reduction of search space
    to precisely identify behavioral regressions.
  professional_approach:
    - Treat commit history as forensic evidence
    - Classify commits as good or bad based on behavior
    - Narrow scope methodically
    - Preserve repository integrity
  real_world_context:
    - Used during production incident investigations
    - Common in large, long-lived repositories
    - Essential for post-incident root cause analysis
