title: Determine Cause of a Regional Service Collapse
stack: aws
domain: reliability
difficulty: Hard
xp: 150

goal: >
  Perform an evidence-based architectural Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
  explaining how a localized infrastructure failure escalated
  into a region-wide service collapse.

skills:
  - outage-analysis
  - failure-propagation
  - reliability-engineering
  - architectural-rca

validator: validator.py

hint:
  - Focus on why the service failed at the regional level, even though the initial failure was localized.

mentor:
  why: >
    Clear and explicit capacity and failure-domain behavior prevents
    localized infrastructure issues from escalating into region-wide outages
    and makes system limitations visible before incidents occur.
  intent: applied
  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how traffic redistribution and capacity limits
      interact during infrastructure failures.
    after: >
      Your analysis should clearly explain how architectural decisions
      allowed failure impact to propagate beyond the initial fault domain
      and why the remaining infrastructure could not stabilize the service.

solution:
  overview: >
    Hard-level RCA focuses on evidence correlation rather than fix implementation.
    Engineers must distinguish symptoms from causes and justify conclusions using
    only the provided architectural and timeline artifacts.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Identify the observable regional failure state experienced by users
    - Correlate the outage timeline with traffic redistribution behavior
    - Trace the failure escalation to concrete architectural or capacity limits
    - Explain why the system could not stabilize after the initial fault

  real_world_context:
    - Avoid speculative or unverifiable root causes
    - Preserve strict evidence-to-conclusion traceability
    - Separate failure containment from failure prevention
    - Ensure conclusions are auditable and architecturally grounded
