title: "Assess a Multi-Zone Failover Strategy"
stack: aws
domain: reliability
difficulty: Medium
xp: 100

goal: >
  Assess an existing multi-Availability Zone AWS web architecture
  and evaluate how it responds to infrastructure failures.

skills:
  - aws-ha-review
  - failure-analysis
  - availability-reasoning

validator: "validator.py"

hint: >
  Use the failure events to reason about how traffic was handled.

mentor:
  why: >
    Engineers must validate high availability assumptions
    before failures occur in production.
  intent: applied
  guidance:
    before: |
      Identify how failures are isolated across Availability Zones.
      Think about how load balancing and redundancy should behave
      during an AZ-level failure.
    after: >
      You should be able to explain whether the observed behavior
      matches expected multi-AZ failover characteristics.
