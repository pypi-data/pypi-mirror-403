# Evaluate an Internet-Facing Web Stack

Objective:

This lab verifies your ability to **evaluate an existing
internet-facing AWS web architecture**.

You are reviewing a proposed architecture **before any resources
are created**, focusing on **exposure, structure, and request flow**.

This reflects real-world architecture reviews performed during
design approvals and security pre-checks.

---
Provided Evidence:

You are given a written description of an AWS public web application
architecture.

Refer to:
- `artifacts/architecture-requirements.md`

This document represents the **only information available** for review.

---
Task Requirements :

Edit the local file **`architecture-review.md`** and explain:

1. Which components are **publicly exposed**
2. Which components should remain **private**
3. How user traffic flows from the internet to the application
4. Whether this exposure is appropriate for a basic public web application

Your response should demonstrate **reasoning and understanding**,
not service memorization.

---
Constraints:

- Do NOT design a new architecture
- Do NOT introduce additional services
- Do NOT propose improvements or changes
- Evaluate **only what is described**
- Work fully **offline and locally**
