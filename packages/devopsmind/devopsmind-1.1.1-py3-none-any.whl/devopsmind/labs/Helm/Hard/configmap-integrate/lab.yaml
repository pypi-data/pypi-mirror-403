title: "Deployment must mount ConfigMap created via template"
stack: helm
difficulty: Hard
xp: 150
goal: "Integrate a ConfigMap into a Helm chart and mount it correctly within a Kubernetes Deployment"

skills:
  - helm-templating
  - configmap-management
  - kubernetes-deployments

hint: "Create configmap.yaml using {{ .Values.config.message }} and mount it via volumes and volumeMounts."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "This lab reinforces how Helm templates coordinate multiple Kubernetes resources by externalizing configuration through ConfigMaps."
  intent: stretch

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how Helm templates allow configuration to be shared across multiple Kubernetes resources without duplication.
    after: |
      Consider how this pattern enables environment-specific configuration without modifying application images.

execution:
  runtime: docker

solution:
  summary: "The chart defines configuration in values.yaml, renders it into a ConfigMap template, and mounts it into the Deployment using volumes and volumeMounts."
