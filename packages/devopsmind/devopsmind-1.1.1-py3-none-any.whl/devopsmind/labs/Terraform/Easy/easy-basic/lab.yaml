goal: "Define a basic Terraform configuration with a provider block"

skills:
  - terraform-basics
  - provider-configuration

hint: "main.tf must define provider \"aws\" with region = \"us-east-1\"."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "This lab introduces the foundational Terraform concept of providers, which define how Terraform communicates with infrastructure platforms."
  intent: fundamental

  guidance:
    before: |
      Focus on understanding what a Terraform provider represents and how provider
      configuration enables Terraform to interact with external systems.

      Optional manual verification commands (not required for validation):
      These commands operate only on local files.

      - terraform fmt -check
      - terraform validate
    after: |
      Try modifying the provider configuration or adding an additional provider
      to understand how Terraform handles multiple providers.
