title: "Create an AWS S3 Bucket Using Terraform"
stack: terraform
difficulty: Medium
xp: 100

goal: "Provision an AWS S3 bucket using a Terraform resource definition"

skills:
  - terraform-resources
  - infrastructure-as-code
  - aws-s3

hint: "main.tf must define resource aws_s3_bucket \"devops_bucket\" with bucket = \"devopsmind-bucket\"."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "This lab demonstrates how Terraform resources declaratively define desired infrastructure state, which is the foundation of infrastructure as code."
  intent: applied

  guidance:
    before: |
      Review how Terraform resource blocks describe desired state
      without executing real infrastructure changes.

      Optional manual file verification commands (not required for validation):
      These commands operate only on local files.

      - terraform fmt -check
      - terraform validate
    after: |
      Extend the resource with tags, versioning, or lifecycle rules
      to practice managing production-ready infrastructure.

  tags:
    - terraform
    - aws
    - s3
    - resources

execution:
  runtime: docker
  requires_execution: false
  required_tools:
    - terraform
