GCP Web Architecture – Requirements

The architecture includes:

- A global HTTP(S) load balancer
- Compute resources deployed across multiple regions
- A managed object storage service for static assets
- A single GCP project with shared networking

The design reflects a production-grade,
regionally distributed web application.
