goal: >
  Assess whether a GCP web architecture maintains service continuity
  during infrastructure failures using provided architectural
  and failure evidence.

skills:
  - gcp-architecture-review
  - availability-reasoning
  - failure-awareness

validator: validator.py

hint:
  - Focus on what failed, what continued operating, and why users were not fully impacted.

mentor:
  why: Availability must be assessed using observed failure evidence.
  intent: Teach reasoning about service continuity under partial failure.
  guidance:
