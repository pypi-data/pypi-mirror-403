# Assess Cross-Region Continuity Planning

Objective:

Assess service continuity in a GCP web architecture
during an infrastructure failure.

You are reviewing an existing architecture and
recorded failure behavior, not designing a new system.

---
Requirements:

Your analysis must be based strictly on the provided
architecture description and failure evidence.

All conclusions must be evidence-based.

---
Task Requirements:

Edit the local file continuity-review.md and explain:

1. Which infrastructure components failed
2. Which components continued operating
3. How traffic was handled during the failure
4. Whether service continuity was achieved and why

---
Constraints:

Do NOT design a new architecture
Do NOT propose improvements or fixes
Do NOT introduce additional services
Do NOT assume behavior not shown in evidence
Work fully offline and locally
