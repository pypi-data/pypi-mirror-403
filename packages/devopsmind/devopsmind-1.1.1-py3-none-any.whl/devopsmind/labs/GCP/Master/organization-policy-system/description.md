# Evaluate an Organization Policy System

Objective:

Evaluate and articulate a GCP organization-level
cloud policy system under real organizational
and financial constraints.

At scale, cloud failures and cost overruns
are rarely technical. They emerge from
poorly designed governance systems.

---
Requirements:

Your response must be based strictly on the
provided organizational overview, cost signals,
and governance constraints.

All conclusions must reflect realistic
enterprise decision-making.

---
Task Requirements:

Edit the local file cloud-governance-policy.md
and document:

1. The scope of the policy system
2. How ownership and accountability are assigned
3. Core cost governance principles
4. High-level usage guardrails
5. The trade-offs made and why they are acceptable

---
Constraints:

Do NOT propose tools, automation, or enforcement
Do NOT reference IaC or provisioning
Focus on policy, accountability, and decision-making
Work fully offline and locally
