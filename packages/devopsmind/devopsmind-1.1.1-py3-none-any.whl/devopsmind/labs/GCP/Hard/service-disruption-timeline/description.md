# Reconstruct a Service Disruption Timeline

---
Objective:

Reconstruct a service disruption in a GCP web architecture
by correlating architecture context, event timelines,
and operational evidence.

The goal is not to fix the system,
but to explain what happened, in what order,
and why users were affected.

---
Requirements:

You must base your analysis strictly on the provided
architecture description, failure timeline,
and outage event records.

All conclusions must be evidence-based.

---
Task Requirements:

Edit the local file rca.md and document:

1. The sequence of failure events
2. The initial infrastructure failure
3. How the failure propagated
4. Why users experienced service degradation

---
Constraints:

Do NOT propose fixes or redesigns
Do NOT reference tooling or provisioning
Do NOT assume behavior not shown in evidence
Work fully offline and locally
