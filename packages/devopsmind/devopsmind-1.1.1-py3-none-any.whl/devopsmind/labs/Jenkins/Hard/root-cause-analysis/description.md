# Perform Root Cause Analysis for a Jenkins CI Failure

Objective:

Perform a structured Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for a Jenkins CI pipeline
failure using only provided evidence.

This lab evaluates the ability to separate symptoms from root cause,
correlate multiple CI artifacts, and document defensible conclusions in a
professional RCA format.

---
Requirements:

- Analysis must be based entirely on provided CI artifacts
- The RCA must follow a clear incident analysis structure
- The task must be completed fully offline
- No Jenkins execution or test execution is required
- Reasoning must be evidence-based and review-ready

---
Task Requirements:

- Review all provided CI artifacts:
  - Jenkinsfile
  - build logs
  - test logs
  - failure timeline
- Identify the observed failure and where it occurred
- Determine the primary root cause supported by evidence
- Identify at least one contributing factor
- Propose one corrective action to prevent recurrence
- Complete the RCA in rca.md using clear, professional language

---
Constraints:

- Do NOT execute Jenkins or pipeline stages
- Do NOT modify any artifact files
- Do NOT invent system behavior or assumptions
- Every claim must be supported by provided evidence
- Focus on analysis and reasoning, not fixes or tooling
