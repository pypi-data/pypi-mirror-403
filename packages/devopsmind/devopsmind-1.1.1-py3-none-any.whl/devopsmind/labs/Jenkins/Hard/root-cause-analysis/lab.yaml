title: "Perform Root Cause Analysis for a Jenkins CI Failure"
stack: jenkins
difficulty: Hard
xp: 150

goal: "Perform a structured, evidence-based root cause analysis using Jenkins CI artifacts"

skills:
  - rca
  - ci-failure-analysis
  - evidence-correlation

hint: "Separate symptoms, root cause, contributing factors, and corrective action clearly."

validator: "validator.py"

execution:
  runtime: docker
  requires_execution: false

    - jenkins

mentor:
  why: "Repeated CI failures waste engineering time and slow delivery when root causes are not clearly understood."
  intent: responsibility

  guidance:
    before: |
      Identify observable facts from logs and timelines before drawing conclusions.
      Focus on what failed, where it failed, and the exact error involved.
    after: |
      A strong RCA should be defensible during technical review and post-incident discussion.

solution:
  overview: >
    At hard level, root cause analysis is about disciplined reasoning rather
    than fixing pipelines. This lab evaluates whether an engineer can
    reconstruct a CI failure using only evidence, clearly separating symptoms
    from the true underlying cause.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Symptoms describe what failed, not why it failed
    - Root causes must be directly supported by logs or timelines
    - CI failures often occur earlier than where they are reported
    - Clear corrective actions prevent recurrence without speculation

  real_world_context:
    - CI incident reviews require defensible, evidence-based conclusions
    - Poor RCAs lead to repeated failures and loss of trust in CI systems
    - Senior engineers are expected to document failures clearly for review
