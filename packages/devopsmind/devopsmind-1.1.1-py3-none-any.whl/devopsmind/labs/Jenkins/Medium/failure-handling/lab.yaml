stack: jenkins
difficulty: Medium
xp: 100
goal: "Design a CI pipeline that explicitly handles and surfaces test failures."

skills:
  - ci-design
  - failure-handling
  - log-awareness

hint: "CI pipelines should fail fast and make failures clearly visible."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Real CI pipelines must clearly surface failures so engineers can quickly understand what broke and where."
  intent: applied

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how CI pipelines communicate failure through both structure and logs, not just exit codes.
    after: |
      Consider how clear stage boundaries and failure notes help teams diagnose issues quickly during reviews and incidents.
