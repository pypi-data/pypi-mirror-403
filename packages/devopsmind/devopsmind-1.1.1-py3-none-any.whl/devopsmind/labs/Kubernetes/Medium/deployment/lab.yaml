title: "Create a Deployment with 3 replicas"
stack: kubernetes
difficulty: Medium
xp: 100
goal: "Create a Kubernetes Deployment that manages multiple replicas of an application"

skills:
  - kubernetes-deployments
  - replica-management
  - declarative-configuration

hint: "deployment.yaml must define a Deployment named web-deploy with 3 replicas running nginx:1.21."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "This lab demonstrates how Kubernetes Deployments manage application replicas declaratively, enabling scalability, resilience, and controlled updates."
  intent: applied

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how a Deployment manages Pods and maintains the desired number of replicas over time.

      Optional manual commands (not required for validation):
      These commands operate only on local files.
      Results are for personal verification only.

      - kubectl explain deployment
      - kubectl explain deployment.spec.replicas
    after: |
      Consider how Deployments enable scaling and rolling updates compared to standalone Pods.
