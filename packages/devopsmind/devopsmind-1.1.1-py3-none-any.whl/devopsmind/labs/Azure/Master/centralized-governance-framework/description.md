# Evaluate a Centralized Governance Framework

Objective:
This lab verifies your ability to evaluate and articulate
a centralized Azure governance framework under real organizational
and cost constraints.

At enterprise scale, cloud failures are rarely technical.
They emerge from weak ownership models, poor cost visibility,
and unrealistic governance controls.

Your task is to define a practical governance framework
that would function in this organization.

---
Requirements:

You must reason strictly from the provided organizational context,
cost signals, and governance constraints located in the configs directory.

These inputs intentionally conflict and require explicit trade-offs.

---
Task Requirements:

Edit the local file cloud-governance-policy.md and document:

1. The scope of the governance framework
2. How ownership and accountability are assigned
3. Core cost governance principles
4. High-level usage guardrails
5. The trade-offs made and why they are acceptable

Your response is evaluated on judgment, realism,
and trade-off clarity rather than completeness.

---
Constraints:

Do NOT propose tools, scripts, or automation
Do NOT define enforcement mechanisms
Do NOT reference IaC or provisioning
Focus on policy, accountability, and organizational design
Work fully offline and locally
