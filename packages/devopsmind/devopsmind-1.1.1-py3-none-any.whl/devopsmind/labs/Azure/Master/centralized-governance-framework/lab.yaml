title: Evaluate a Centralized Governance Framework
stack: azure
domain: governance
difficulty: Master
xp: 500

goal: >
  Evaluate and articulate an Azure centralized governance framework
  that balances cost control, ownership, and team autonomy
  using provided organizational and financial evidence.

skills:
  - cloud-governance-judgment
  - organizational-design
  - cost-governance
  - policy-tradeoff-analysis

validator: validator.py

hint:
  - Strong governance frameworks constrain cost and risk without blocking delivery.

mentor:
  why: Azure governance failures scale cost and security risk rapidly.
  intent: applied
  guidance:
    before: |
      Review organizational structure, cost signals,
      and stated governance constraints from the provided configs.
    after: >
      Governance frameworks must reflect realistic organizational
      trade-offs rather than idealized control models.

solution:
  overview: >
    Master-level governance judgment evaluates how well a centralized
    framework balances cost control, accountability, and team autonomy
    at enterprise scale. The emphasis is on policy realism and
    sustainability rather than enforcement mechanisms.

  approach:
    - Define the scope where centralized governance is justified
    - Assign ownership boundaries across teams and subscriptions
    - Articulate cost control principles that preserve delivery velocity
    - Establish guardrails that reduce systemic risk without micromanagement
    - Make explicit trade-offs and justify why they are acceptable

  professional_considerations:
    - Avoid tool-centric or enforcement-based thinking
    - Prioritize accountability clarity over rigid controls
    - Accept imperfect governance to prevent shadow IT
    - Ensure policies are auditable and understandable at scale
