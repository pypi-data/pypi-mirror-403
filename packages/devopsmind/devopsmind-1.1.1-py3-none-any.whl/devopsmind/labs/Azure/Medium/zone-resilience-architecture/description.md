# Evaluate Zone-Level Resilience Architecture

Objective:
This lab verifies your ability to evaluate zone-level resilience
in an Azure web architecture using observed failure evidence.

You are not designing a new system.
You are reviewing an existing architecture description and
a recorded zone failure to assess whether resilience goals were met.

---
Requirements:

You must reason strictly from the provided architecture intent
and failure evidence.

No assumptions about unobserved Azure behavior are allowed.

---
Task Requirements:

Edit the local file resilience-review.md and explain:

1. Which infrastructure components failed
2. Which components continued operating
3. How traffic was handled during the zone failure
4. Whether zone-level resilience was achieved and why

Your assessment must be based only on the provided evidence.

---
Constraints:

Do NOT design or redesign architecture
Do NOT propose fixes or improvements
Do NOT introduce additional Azure services
Do NOT assume behavior not shown in evidence
Work fully offline and locally
