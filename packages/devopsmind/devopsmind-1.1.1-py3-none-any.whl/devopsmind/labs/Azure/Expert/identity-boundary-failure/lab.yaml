title: Examine an Identity Boundary Failure
stack: azure
domain: security
difficulty: Expert
xp: 300

goal: >
  Perform an evidence-based analysis explaining how
  identity scope and trust boundaries amplified blast radius
  during an Azure security incident.

skills:
  - cloud-security-architecture
  - blast-radius-analysis
  - identity-boundary-reasoning
  - incident-analysis

validator: validator.py

hint:
  - Focus on how shared identity and trust boundaries enabled lateral movement after the initial compromise.

mentor:
  why: Security incidents escalate when identity boundaries are weak.
  intent: applied
  guidance:
    before: |
      Identify identity, network, and resource trust boundaries
      strictly from the provided artifacts.
    after: >
      Your analysis should explain why identity and trust boundaries
      failed to contain blast radius beyond the initial VM.

solution:
  overview: >
    Expert-level security analysis evaluates how identity scope
    and trust boundaries determine blast radius during incidents.
    The focus is on architectural identity design, not exploits.

  approach:
    - Identify the effective identity, network, and resource boundaries
    - Correlate incident events with identity reuse
    - Trace how shared trust enabled lateral access
    - Explain why blast radius extended beyond a single VM

  professional_considerations:
    - Avoid speculative or tool-based explanations
    - Preserve strict evidence-to-conclusion traceability
    - Separate initial compromise from blast radius amplification
    - Ensure conclusions are auditable and architecture-driven
