  why: >
    This lab introduces the structure and flow of Ansible playbooks,

      Optional manual testing (not required for validation):
      - ansible-playbook playbook.yml
      - ansible-playbook playbook.yml --check
    after: >
      Consider how additional tasks could be added while keeping the playbook
      readable and predictable.
