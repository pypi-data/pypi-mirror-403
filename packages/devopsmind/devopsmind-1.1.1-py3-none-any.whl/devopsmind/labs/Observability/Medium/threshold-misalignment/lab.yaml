title: "Identify misaligned alert thresholds"
stack: Observability
difficulty: Medium
xp: 100
goal: "Evaluate whether alert thresholds align with real system behavior"

skills:
  - alert-thresholds
  - metrics-evaluation
  - operational-judgment

hint:
  - Thresholds define sensitivity.
  - Frequent warnings may indicate over-sensitivity.

mentor:
  why: "Poorly tuned thresholds generate noise and reduce trust in alerts."
  intent: signal-quality-awareness

  guidance:
    before: |
      Compare alert timing with metric values.
      Observe how often the threshold is crossed.
    after: |
      Reflect on how alert fatigue often begins with misaligned thresholds.
