# Identify misaligned alert thresholds

Objective:

- Understand how alert thresholds affect signal quality.
- Identify alerts that fire too early or too late.
- Practice evaluating alert usefulness using supporting metrics.

---
Requirements:

- Alert messages and corresponding metrics are provided.
- Signals represent the same service and time window.
- The task must be completed fully offline.

---
Task Requirements:

- Review the alerts and metrics together.
- Identify whether the alert threshold is well-aligned with system behavior.
- Explain if the alert fires too early, too late, or appropriately.
- Record your evaluation in **threshold-evaluation.md**.

---
Constraints:

- Do NOT run commands or scripts.
- Do NOT modify any signal files.
- Do NOT redesign alert rules.
- Do NOT perform root cause analysis.
- Focus on threshold alignment, not fixes.
