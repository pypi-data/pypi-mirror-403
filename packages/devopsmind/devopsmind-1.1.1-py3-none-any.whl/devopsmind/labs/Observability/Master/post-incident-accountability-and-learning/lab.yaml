  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider fairness, responsibility, and future resilience.
      Avoid both scapegoating and avoidance.
    after: |
      Reflect on how post-incident decisions influence engineering culture.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the engineer can make responsible,
    long-term decisions after a major incident that balance
    accountability, learning, and organizational trust.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Accountability must be fair, explicit, and constructive
    - Learning-focused outcomes prevent repeat failures
    - Some decisions irreversibly shape culture and expectations
    - Trust is built by consistency, not punishment

  real_world_context:
    - Many organizations fail not during incidents, but after them
    - Blame-driven cultures hide problems instead of fixing them
    - Senior leaders are judged by how their organizations learn
