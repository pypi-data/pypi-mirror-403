solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the engineer can balance
    strict policy enforcement against operational urgency.
    Master-level judgment requires protecting organizational
    trust while enabling responsible recovery.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Policies encode hard-earned organizational lessons
    - Overrides must be explicit, limited, and auditable
    - Risk ownership cannot be delegated
    - Trust erosion is often more costly than downtime

  real_world_context:
    - Many major incidents involve pressure to bypass safeguards
    - Uncontrolled overrides cause long-term damage
    - Senior leaders are judged on how policies are upheld under stress
