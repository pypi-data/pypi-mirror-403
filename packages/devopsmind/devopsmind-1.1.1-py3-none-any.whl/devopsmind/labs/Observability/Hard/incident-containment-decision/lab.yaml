goal: "Make safe containment decisions during an active incident"

skills:
  - incident-response
  - containment-judgment
  - risk-awareness

hint:
  - Containment reduces impact, not causes.
  - Unsafe actions during uncertainty can worsen incidents.

  why: "During incidents, the first decision is often containment, not diagnosis."
  intent: operational-safety

  guidance:
    before: |
      Focus on reducing user impact.
      Avoid irreversible actions without strong evidence.
    after: |
      Reflect on how premature fixes can escalate incidents.

  overview: >
    During active incidents, engineers must often act before
    the root cause is fully understood. This lab evaluates whether
    the engineer can make safe containment decisions that reduce
    user impact while avoiding irreversible or risky actions.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Containment actions aim to stabilize the system, not fix causes
    - Decisions should minimize blast radius under uncertainty
    - Deferring actions is a valid choice when evidence is insufficient
    - Clear separation between immediate and deferred actions prevents escalation

  real_world_context:
    - In production incidents, premature fixes can worsen outages
    - Senior engineers are expected to prioritize safety over speed
    - Incident reviews often focus on decision quality, not just outcomes
