title: "Distinguish symptoms from root cause using metrics"
stack: Observability
difficulty: Hard
xp: 150
goal: "Produce an evidence-based root cause analysis from metrics"

skills:
  - rca
  - metrics-analysis
  - operational-reasoning

hint:
  - Latency often reflects impact, not cause.
  - Look for the metric that changes first and keeps worsening.

mentor:
  why: "Strong engineers separate symptoms from causes to prevent repeat incidents."
  intent: evidence-discipline

  guidance:
    before: |
      Review metrics in time order.
      Identify which metric changes first and persists.
    after: |
      Reflect on how confusing symptoms with causes leads to ineffective fixes.

solution:
  overview: >
    A proper root cause analysis focuses on identifying the underlying
    reason an incident occurred, not just the visible symptoms.
    This lab evaluates whether the engineer can reason from metrics,
    distinguish impact from cause, and document causality clearly.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Symptoms describe impact, not the underlying problem
    - Metrics must be evaluated over time, not in isolation
    - Root cause explanations should describe why behavior emerged
    - Effective RCAs focus on prevention, not blame

  real_world_context:
    - Metrics-driven RCAs are common after production incidents
    - Treating symptoms as causes leads to repeated failures
    - Engineers are expected to communicate findings clearly and precisely
