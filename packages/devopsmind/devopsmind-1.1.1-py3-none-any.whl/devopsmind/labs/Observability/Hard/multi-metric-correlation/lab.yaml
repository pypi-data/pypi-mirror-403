  - rca
  - metrics-correlation
  - operational-reasoning

hint:
  - Look for metrics that change first and persist.
  - Latency often reflects downstream effects.

  why: "Incidents rarely have a single signal; correlation separates cause from consequence."
  intent: correlation-discipline

  guidance:
    before: |
      Review all metrics together.
      Avoid locking onto the most visible symptom.
    after: |
      Reflect on how multi-metric correlation improves RCA accuracy.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates the engineer’s ability to correlate multiple
    metrics to identify the true root cause of an incident.
    Rather than reacting to the most visible symptom, the focus is on
    analyzing metric relationships, timing, and persistence to produce
    an accurate RCA.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Root cause signals often appear earlier than user-facing symptoms
    - Latency, error rates, and saturation metrics must be analyzed together
    - Persistent metric changes are more reliable than short spikes
    - Correlation requires understanding cause-and-effect, not coincidence
    - Eliminating downstream effects narrows the true failure source

  real_world_context:
    - Production incidents rarely expose the root cause directly
    - Engineers must justify RCA conclusions using evidence, not intuition
    - Incorrect correlation leads to wasted fixes and repeated incidents
    - Post-incident reviews value reasoning clarity over speed
