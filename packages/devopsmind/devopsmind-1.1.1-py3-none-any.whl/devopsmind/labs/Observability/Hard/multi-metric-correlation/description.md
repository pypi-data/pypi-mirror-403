# Correlate multiple metrics to identify root cause

Objective:

- Practice correlating multiple metrics during an incident.
- Identify which metrics indicate symptoms versus underlying causes.
- Produce a precise root cause analysis using evidence.

---
Requirements:

- A metrics snapshot captured during an incident is provided.
- Metrics represent the same system and time window.
- The system state is preloaded.
- The task must be completed fully offline.

---
Task Requirements:

- Review all provided metrics together.
- Identify relationships between metrics over time.
- Determine which metric behavior indicates the underlying cause.
- Produce a structured root cause analysis.
- Record your analysis in **rca.md**.

---
Constraints:

- Do NOT run commands or scripts.
- Do NOT modify evidence files.
- Do NOT speculate beyond the metrics provided.
- Do NOT focus on a single metric in isolation.
- Base conclusions strictly on metric correlation.
