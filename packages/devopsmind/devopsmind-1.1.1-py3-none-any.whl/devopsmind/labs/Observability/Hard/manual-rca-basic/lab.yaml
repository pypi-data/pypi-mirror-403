stack: observability
difficulty: Hard
xp: 150
goal: "Produce a structured root cause analysis based on logs and metrics"

skills:
  - rca
  - incident-analysis
  - operational-reasoning

hint: "Trace the incident timeline backward to separate symptoms from the underlying cause."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Root cause analysis prevents repeat failures by forcing engineers to distinguish symptoms from true causes and to document learning clearly."
  intent: responsibility

  guidance:
    before: |
      Focus on understanding the sequence of events and identifying why the system behaved the way it did.
      Avoid restating symptoms as causes.
    after: |
      Consider what monitoring signal or alert could have detected the issue earlier.

solution:
  overview: >
    A proper root cause analysis focuses on identifying the underlying reason
    an incident occurred, not just the visible symptoms. This lab evaluates
    whether the engineer can reason from evidence, construct a clear timeline,
    and document causality in a structured and professional manner.
  professional_reasoning:
    - Symptoms describe impact, not cause
    - Timelines help separate triggering events from escalation
    - Metrics provide objective evidence of system behavior
    - Clear RCAs enable learning and prevention, not blame
  real_world_context:
    - RCAs are standard practice after production incidents
    - Poorly written RCAs lead to repeated failures
    - Engineers are expected to communicate findings clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
