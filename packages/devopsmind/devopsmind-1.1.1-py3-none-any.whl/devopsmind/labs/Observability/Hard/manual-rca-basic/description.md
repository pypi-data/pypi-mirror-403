# Write a manual root cause analysis

Objective:

- Perform a manual root cause analysis for a simulated production incident.
- Practice disciplined reasoning to distinguish symptoms from underlying causes.
- Communicate incident findings clearly using a structured RCA format.

---
Requirements:

- Metrics data representing system behavior over time is provided.
- A placeholder RCA document is provided and must be completed.
- The analysis must be performed fully offline without executing code.

---
Task Requirements:

- Review the provided metrics data carefully.
- Identify the sequence of events leading up to the incident.
- Determine the primary root cause rather than secondary symptoms.
- Edit the file named rca.md.
- Replace all placeholder content with your own analysis.
- Ensure the RCA includes:
  - An incident summary describing what happened.
  - A timeline outlining key events with timestamps.
  - A root cause section explaining why the incident occurred.
  - Corrective actions describing how recurrence can be prevented.
- Use clear, professional language suitable for an incident review.

---
Constraints:

- Do NOT run scripts or code.
- Do NOT modify the provided metrics data.
- Do NOT invent events or data not supported by the evidence.
- Do NOT focus only on symptoms.
- Validation is static and based on the structure and content of rca.md.
