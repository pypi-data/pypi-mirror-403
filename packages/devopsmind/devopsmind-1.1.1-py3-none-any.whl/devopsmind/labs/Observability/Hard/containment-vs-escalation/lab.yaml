stack: Observability
difficulty: Hard
xp: 150
goal: "Make safe containment or escalation decisions under partial evidence"

skills:
  - incident-response
  - escalation-judgment
  - risk-assessment

hint:
  - Not all incidents should be immediately escalated.
  - Escalation is a risk decision, not a failure.

  why: "Escalation decisions shape incident outcomes and organizational trust."
  intent: decision-accountability

  guidance:
    before: |
      Focus on impact, uncertainty, and blast radius.
      Consider what information is still missing.
    after: |
      Reflect on how unnecessary escalation or delayed escalation can both cause harm.

solution:
  overview: >
    During active incidents, engineers must decide whether to continue
    containment or escalate to broader teams. This lab evaluates whether
    the engineer can assess impact, uncertainty, and risk to make a
    responsible escalation decision.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Escalation is about managing risk, not assigning blame
    - Containment can continue while investigation proceeds
    - Uncertainty increases the cost of irreversible actions
    - Clear justification matters more than the decision itself

  real_world_context:
    - Poor escalation decisions can widen blast radius
    - Over-escalation reduces trust and increases noise
    - Under-escalation can prolong outages and customer impact
    - Senior engineers are judged on decision quality under pressure
