stack: Observability
difficulty: Easy
xp: 50
goal: "Compare logs, metrics, and alerts without over-interpreting them"

skills:
  - signal-comparison
  - observational-judgment
  - observability-basics

hint:
  - Different signals describe different aspects of the system.
  - Agreement between signals is stronger than any single signal alone.

mentor:
  why: "Good observability starts by comparing signals before attempting explanations."
  intent: comparison-discipline
