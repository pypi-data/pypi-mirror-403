title: "Correlate events using timestamps"
stack: Observability
difficulty: Easy
xp: 50
goal: "Use timestamps to reason about event order and correlation"

skills:
  - log-analysis
  - temporal-reasoning
  - signal-correlation

hint:
  - Identify the first error in the timeline.
  - Events immediately following an error are often reactions, not causes.

  why: "Observability depends on understanding when events occur, not just what they report."
  intent: temporal-discipline

  guidance:
    before: |
      Read the logs strictly in time order.
      Focus on sequence, not severity.
    after: |
      Consider how unsynchronized or missing timestamps would affect incident analysis.
