title: "Evaluate dependency trade-offs under partial failure"
stack: Observability
difficulty: Expert
xp: 300
goal: "Make informed trade-offs when a shared dependency is partially failing"

skills:
  - tradeoff-analysis
  - dependency-reasoning
  - risk-management

hint:
  - Not all services have equal business criticality.
  - Degradation can be safer than total failure.

mentor:
  why: "Expert engineers must choose which parts of the system to protect when not everything can be saved."
  intent: tradeoff-discipline

  guidance:
    before: |
      Review dependency criticality and impact.
      Consider business and user-facing consequences.
    after: |
      Reflect on how explicit trade-offs prevent uncontrolled failure.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the engineer can reason about
    partial failures in shared dependencies and make explicit,
    defensible trade-offs to protect overall system health.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Partial failures require selective protection, not blanket actions
    - Business criticality guides prioritization
    - Degradation is often preferable to complete outage
    - Trade-offs should be explicit and well-communicated

  real_world_context:
    - Many large outages involve shared dependency degradation
    - Poor trade-off decisions amplify customer impact
    - Senior engineers are expected to justify sacrifices clearly
