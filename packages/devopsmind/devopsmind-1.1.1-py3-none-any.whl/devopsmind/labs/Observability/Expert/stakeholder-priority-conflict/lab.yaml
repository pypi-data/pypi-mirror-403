solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the engineer can navigate competing
    stakeholder priorities during a live incident and make a
    defensible decision that balances stability, customer impact,
    and organizational risk.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Stakeholder priorities often conflict under pressure
    - Decision ownership cannot be avoided or delegated
    - Protecting data integrity outweighs short-term convenience
    - Clear justification matters more than unanimous agreement

  real_world_context:
    - Major incidents frequently involve business and compliance tension
    - Poor stakeholder handling can create long-term organizational damage
    - Senior engineers are expected to lead through conflict
