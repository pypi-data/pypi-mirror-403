title: "Decide which observability signals to trust during an incident"
stack: Observability
difficulty: Expert
xp: 300
goal: "Assess and prioritize observability signals when data conflicts"

skills:
  - signal-evaluation
  - observability-judgment
  - incident-analysis

hint:
  - Not all observability signals fail equally.
  - Data pipelines can lie under stress.

mentor:
  why: "Expert engineers must judge observability systems, not blindly trust them."
  intent: signal-discipline

  guidance:
    before: |
      Compare signals across layers.
      Question why signals might disagree.
    after: |
      Reflect on incidents caused by misleading monitoring.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the engineer can reason about
    the reliability of observability signals when metrics,
    logs, and alerts disagree. Expert judgment focuses on
    signal provenance, degradation, and impact on decisions.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Observability systems can fail or mislead under load
    - Logs often reveal truth before aggregated metrics
    - Suppression and sampling introduce blind spots
    - Trust decisions must be explicit and justified

  real_world_context:
    - Many incidents worsen due to false confidence in metrics
    - Senior engineers are expected to question monitoring data
    - Signal trust failures often delay correct response
