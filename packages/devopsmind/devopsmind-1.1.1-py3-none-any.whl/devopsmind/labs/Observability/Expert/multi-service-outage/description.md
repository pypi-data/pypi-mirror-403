# Diagnose a multi-service outage

Objective:

- Analyze a simulated outage affecting multiple services.
- Identify the true root cause by reasoning about service dependencies.
- Demonstrate expert-level systems thinking rather than surface-level diagnosis.

---
Requirements:

- A placeholder analysis file is provided and must be completed.
- The analysis must be based only on the information provided.
- No execution, automation, or live diagnostics are required.

---
Task Requirements:

- Review the provided outage scenario carefully.
- Identify which service or component failed first.
- Explain how that failure propagated to other services.
- Distinguish between primary causes and secondary symptoms.
- Edit the file named analysis.txt.
- Replace all placeholder content with your own analysis.
- Clearly explain why the identified failure represents the true root cause.

---
Constraints:

- Do NOT modify logs or supporting files.
- Do NOT assume data that is not explicitly provided.
- Do NOT focus only on the most visible failures.
- Validation is static and based on the reasoning expressed in analysis.txt.
