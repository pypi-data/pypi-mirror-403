stack: observability
difficulty: Expert
xp: 300
goal: "Identify the true root cause of a cascading outage across multiple dependent services"

skills:
  - dependency-analysis
  - systems-thinking
  - incident-analysis

hint: "Identify the first failing dependency rather than the services that fail last."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "In distributed systems, outages often propagate across hidden dependencies. Engineers must reason about causality, not visibility."
  intent: systems-thinking

  guidance:
    before: |
      Focus on identifying the earliest failure in the dependency chain.
      Separate visible downstream symptoms from the upstream root cause.
    after: |
      Consider how service dependency maps or tracing could reduce time to diagnosis.

solution:
  overview: >
    Expert-level outage analysis requires identifying causal failures in complex,
    interdependent systems. This lab evaluates whether an engineer can
    distinguish upstream root causes from downstream symptoms in a cascading failure.
  professional_reasoning:
    - Visible errors are often secondary effects
    - Dependency chains determine failure propagation
    - True root causes usually occur earlier than the most obvious failures
    - Systems thinking is required to avoid misattribution
  real_world_context:
    - Large-scale outages frequently originate in shared dependencies
    - Incident reviews demand explanation of propagation, not just failure points
    - Senior engineers are expected to reason across services, not in isolation
