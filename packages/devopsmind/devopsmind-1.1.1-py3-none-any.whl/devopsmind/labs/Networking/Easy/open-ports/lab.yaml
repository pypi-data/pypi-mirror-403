  - networking-basics
  - port-scanning

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Testing whether network ports are open is a foundational troubleshooting and security skill for understanding service availability and connectivity."
  intent: applied

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how services listen on ports and how a script can test connectivity without sending application data.

      Optional manual commands (not required for validation):
      These commands operate only on local files.

      - ss -tuln
      - netstat -tuln
