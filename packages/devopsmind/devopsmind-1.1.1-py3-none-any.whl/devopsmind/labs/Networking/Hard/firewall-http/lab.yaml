stack: networking
difficulty: Hard
xp: 150
goal: "Analyze firewall rules to ensure HTTP traffic is allowed while other inbound traffic is restricted"

skills:
  - firewall-configuration
  - network-security
  - traffic-filtering

hint: "Analyze firewall status output to verify that only port 80 is allowed."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Correct firewall configuration is a core network security skill, requiring careful analysis to ensure required services are accessible while minimizing exposure."
  intent: stretch

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how firewall rule sets are evaluated and how default-deny policies affect inbound traffic.
    after: |
      Consider how firewall misconfiguration can unintentionally expose services or block legitimate traffic.

solution:
  overview: >
    At hard level, firewall analysis focuses on correctness and intent rather
    than rule syntax. This lab evaluates whether an engineer can verify
    that firewall rules enforce a least-privilege policy while preserving
    required service access.
  professional_reasoning:
    - Firewalls should follow default-deny principles
    - Explicit allow rules must be validated carefully
    - Security analysis focuses on outcomes, not commands
    - Clear verification prevents accidental exposure
  real_world_context:
    - Misconfigured firewalls are common causes of breaches
    - Engineers often audit firewall state rather than configure it
    - Production environments require confidence in traffic restrictions
