# Create a Basic Dockerfile

Objective:
Understand how to create a minimal Dockerfile that builds a container image
and defines a command executed when the container starts.

---
Requirements:

You must author a Dockerfile using only the provided instructions.
The task focuses on Dockerfile structure and correctness, not execution.

---
Task Requirements:

Create a file named Dockerfile.

The Dockerfile must:
- Use the python:3.10-slim base image
- Define a command that prints exactly: Hello Docker
- Use either CMD or ENTRYPOINT to define the runtime command

---
Constraints:

Do NOT build or run the container
Do NOT use Docker Compose or additional tooling
Do NOT add unnecessary layers or optimizations
Work fully offline and locally
