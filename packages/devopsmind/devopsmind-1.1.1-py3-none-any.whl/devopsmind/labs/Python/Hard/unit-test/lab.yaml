title: "Implement function that passes the unit test"
stack: python
difficulty: Hard
xp: 150
goal: "Implement a Python function strictly driven by existing unit tests"

skills:
  - unit-testing
  - test-driven-development
  - python-debugging

hint: "Read the unit tests carefully and implement only what is required to satisfy them."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Test-driven development requires engineers to derive correct behavior from tests rather than assumptions."
  intent: stretch

  guidance:
    before: |
      Carefully read the provided unit tests to understand required behavior.
      Focus on satisfying test expectations rather than adding extra logic.
    after: |
      Consider how edge cases or additional tests could improve coverage.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates the ability to implement functionality
    based solely on existing unit tests. The correct solution is
    determined entirely by test expectations, not by additional assumptions.
  key_points:
    - Tests define required behavior
    - Implementation must be minimal and precise
    - All test cases must pass without modification
  real_world_context:
    - Common in mature codebases with existing test suites
    - Essential for safe refactoring and regression prevention
