mentor:
  why: |
    Log parsing underpins observability, analytics, and incident response.
    At senior levels, engineers must produce deterministic summaries that
    can be trusted by downstream systems.

  intent: mastery

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how to separate concerns:
      - input reading
      - parsing
      - aggregation
      - ordered reporting

    after: |
      Consider how your solution would behave with:
      - large files
      - unexpected log levels
      - malformed lines

  tags:
    - python
    - log-parsing
    - data-processing
    - analytics
    - mastery

solution:
  overview: >
    At master level, log parsing is not about reading lines,
    but about producing deterministic, auditable summaries
    that can safely drive dashboards, alerts, or automation.

    This lab evaluates whether an engineer can extract,
    aggregate, and report structured information with precision
    and stable output guarantees.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Logs must be parsed defensively
    - Aggregation logic must be explicit
    - Output order must be deterministic
    - No assumptions beyond provided data

  real_world_context:
    - Log summaries feed alerting systems
    - Non-deterministic output breaks automation
    - Stable formats are required for downstream consumers

  runtime: docker
  requires_execution: true
