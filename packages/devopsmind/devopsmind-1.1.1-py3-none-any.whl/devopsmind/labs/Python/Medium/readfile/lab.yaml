title: "File Reader CLI"
stack: python
difficulty: Medium
xp: 100
goal: "Implement a Python CLI tool that reads a file path from arguments and prints its contents"

skills:
  - python-cli
  - file-io
  - argparse

hint: "The script must print the file contents exactly, with no extra output."

validator: "validator.py"

mentor:
  why: "Many real-world Python tools are simple command-line programs that read input from files and write output to stdout. This lab builds that foundational skill."
  intent: applied

  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how command-line arguments are accessed in Python.
      Be careful to print only the file contents, without additional text.

      Optional manual commands (not required for validation):
      These commands operate only on local files.
      Results are for personal verification only.

    after: |
      Consider how you might handle missing files or add optional flags in a real CLI.
