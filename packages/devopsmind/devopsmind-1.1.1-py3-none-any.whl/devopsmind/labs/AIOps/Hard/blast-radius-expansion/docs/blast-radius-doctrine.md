# Operational Judgment Doctrine — Blast Radius Expansion

This document defines the judgment standards applied in this lab.
It does not describe correct actions or expected conclusions.

---

## Purpose of This Lab

This lab evaluates how engineers preserve containment discipline
when AI-assisted decisions influence incident response.

The focus is on scope control, authority, and accountability —
not on improving automation or deployment mechanisms.

---

## Containment Authority

In this environment:

- AI systems may suggest actions affecting scope
- AI systems do not own containment boundaries
- Human responders retain full authority over scope and isolation

Expanding scope is a human decision.
Failing to preserve containment is also a decision.

Responsibility cannot be delegated to automation.

---

## Blast Radius Judgment Standard

A judgment failure exists when:

- Containment boundaries are known
- Scope expansion is possible
- Human responders allow propagation due to automated guidance

Describing technical spread without identifying decision points
does not meet this standard.

---

## Accountability Expectation

A valid analysis must:

- Identify where containment authority resided
- Explain why scope was allowed to expand
- Assign accountability to a role or decision owner

Diffuse responsibility or passive framing is insufficient.

---

## Post-Failure Control Expectation

After blast radius expansion, acceptable responses focus on:

- Restricting AI influence over scope-affecting decisions
- Reinforcing human authority over containment boundaries
- Preventing automated amplification during incidents

Tooling changes or retraining alone
do not address the judgment failure evaluated here.

## Evaluation Boundary

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated.
It does not prescribe correct answers.

You are expected to apply these standards independently
to the incident presented in the lab.
