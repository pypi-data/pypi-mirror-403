# Blast Radius Context

In some production environments, automated or AI-assisted decisions
can influence how broadly changes or actions are applied during incidents.

In operational use:
- Incidents may initially affect a limited scope
- Containment boundaries are intended to prevent propagation
- Automated guidance can influence decisions that affect scope

In the lab scenario represented here:
- An incident began within a limited containment boundary
- AI-assisted decisions influenced subsequent actions
- The affected scope expanded beyond the initial boundary

This document provides environmental context only.
It does not describe causes, responsibility, or correct actions.
