goal: "Assess operational damage when AI-assisted decisions expand incident blast radius"

skills:
  - blast-radius-analysis
  - risk-containment
  - aiops-decision-evaluation
  - operational-accountability

hint:
  - Assume the AI recommendation increased scope of impact.
  - Focus on containment failure, not initial cause.

  why: >
    One of the core responsibilities of DevOps engineers
    during incidents is to contain blast radius.
    When AI recommendations unintentionally widen impact,
    the damage compounds rapidly.
  intent: stretch
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider how decisions affect scope during incidents.

      Think about:
      - When actions affect more systems than intended
      - How automation accelerates spread
      - Why humans trust AI-driven expansion

      Optional manual inspection (not required for validation):
      - Review read-only incident timelines or change summaries
    after: >
      Reflect on whether AI systems should ever
      influence actions that expand blast radius.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames senior-level reasoning when
    AI-assisted decisions expand the blast radius
    of a production incident. The focus is on
    recognizing containment failure and restoring
    defensive operational posture.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat scope expansion as a critical risk signal
    - Assume automation accelerates blast radius
    - Reassert containment-first decision-making
    - Evaluate whether AI violated containment principles

  real_world_context:
    - Do not propose rollback automation or tooling
    - Do not redesign deployment or isolation systems
    - Identify how AI guidance widened impact
    - Assess damage realistically
    - Favor restriction when AI undermines containment
