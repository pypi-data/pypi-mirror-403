# Assess Impact of AI-Induced Blast Radius Expansion

Objective:

- Analyze the operational risk created when AI-assisted decisions
  expand the blast radius of a production incident.
- Evaluate how containment principles were violated.
- Determine accountability and post-incident action.

---
Requirements:

- You must edit and replace the contents of `blast_radius_assessment.md`
  under the provided headings.
- All instructional scaffolding must be removed before validation.

---
Task Requirements:

- Describe the incident and initial containment scope.
- Analyze how AI guidance contributed to blast radius expansion.
- Identify where containment should have been preserved.
- Assess the operational and business impact of expanded scope.
- Decide what must happen to this AI system after the incident.

---
Constraints:

- No AI retraining or tuning.
- No changes to deployment, rollback, or isolation mechanisms.
- No tooling or automation changes.
- Offline, judgment-based analysis only.
- Do not assign blame to individuals.
