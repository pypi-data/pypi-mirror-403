# Automation Bias Context

Some AI-assisted operational systems provide guidance that may influence
escalation decisions during production incidents.

In operational environments:
- Automated recommendations may affect prioritization and response timing
- Conflicting signals can exist between AI guidance and observed conditions
- Escalation authority remains with human responders

In the lab scenario represented here:
- AI guidance was available during a production incident
- Escalation did not occur immediately despite worsening conditions
- Human responders retained the ability to escalate independently

This document provides environmental context only.
It does not describe causes, responsibility, or correct actions.
