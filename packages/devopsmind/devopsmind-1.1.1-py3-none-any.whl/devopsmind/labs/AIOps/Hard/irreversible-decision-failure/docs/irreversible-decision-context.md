# Irreversible Decision Context

Some operational decisions permanently alter systems,
data, customer trust, or regulatory standing.

In production environments:
- Certain actions cannot be undone
- Irreversibility increases decision risk
- Human authority governs irreversible actions

In the lab scenario represented here:
- An irreversible operational decision occurred
- An AI system was involved in the decision process
- Human responders retained final authority

This document provides environmental context only.
It does not describe causes, responsibility, or correct actions.
