goal: "Assess accountability and damage when an AI system influences an irreversible operational decision"

skills:
  - irreversible-decision-analysis
  - risk-ownership
  - aiops-judgment
  - accountability-framing

hint:
  - Assume the decision cannot be undone.
  - Focus on why AI was allowed near irreversibility.

  why: >
    Some operational decisions cannot be reversed.
    When AI systems influence these decisions, the cost of error
    is permanent. This lab evaluates whether such influence
    should ever be allowed.
  intent: stretch
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider decisions in operations that permanently alter
      systems, data, or customer trust.

      Think about:
      - What makes a decision irreversible
      - Why humans defer responsibility before commitment
      - How AI presence shifts perceived accountability
    after: >
      Reflect on whether AI systems should ever be involved
      in decisions that cannot be undone.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames senior-level reasoning when an AI system
    influences an irreversible production decision. The emphasis
    is on recognizing unacceptable risk exposure and defining
    clear exclusion boundaries for AI involvement.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat irreversibility as a hard boundary
    - Assume permanent damage outweighs analytical benefit
    - Reassert absolute human accountability
    - Evaluate whether AI presence violated governance principles

  real_world_context:
    - Do not propose rollback or remediation paths
    - Do not attempt to redesign decision workflows
    - Identify why AI influence was permitted
    - Assess permanent impact realistically
    - Favor permanent removal from irreversible paths
