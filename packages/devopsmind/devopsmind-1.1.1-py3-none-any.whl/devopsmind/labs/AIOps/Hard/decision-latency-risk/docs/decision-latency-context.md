# AI Decision Latency Context

Some AI systems introduce analysis delays
before providing recommendations during incidents.

In operational environments:
- AI analysis may sit in the decision path
- Human responders may wait for automated input
- Time-sensitive decisions remain under human authority

In the lab scenario represented here:
- An AI system provided analysis during an incident
- Human decisions occurred after AI input was received
- The timing of action was influenced by analysis latency
