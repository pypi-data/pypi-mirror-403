goal: "Assess operational damage caused when AI-assisted analysis increases decision latency during incidents"

skills:
  - decision-latency-analysis
  - incident-timing-judgment

  - accountability-assessment

hint:
  - Assume the AI slowed decisions rather than blocking them.
  - Focus on time lost and its consequences.

  why: >
    In incidents, delayed decisions can be as damaging as incorrect ones.
    AI systems that add analysis latency may unintentionally suppress
    timely human action.
  intent: stretch
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider how response time affects incident outcomes.

      Think about:
      - When waiting for AI input feels safer than acting
      - How analysis delays compound impact
      - Why humans hesitate without automated confirmation
    after: >
      Reflect on whether AI analysis should ever sit
      in the critical decision path during incidents.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames senior-level reasoning when AI involvement
    increases decision latency during a live incident. The focus is
    on recognizing harm caused by delayed action and restoring
    time-critical human judgment.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat time loss as operational damage
    - Assume delayed action compounds system impact
    - Reassert human authority in time-critical decisions
    - Evaluate whether AI sat in the critical path

  real_world_context:
    - Do not propose faster models or analysis
    - Do not introduce parallel workflows or tooling
    - Identify how waiting for AI input delayed action
    - Assess impact in terms of time, not correctness
    - Favor removal from critical paths when latency is harmful
