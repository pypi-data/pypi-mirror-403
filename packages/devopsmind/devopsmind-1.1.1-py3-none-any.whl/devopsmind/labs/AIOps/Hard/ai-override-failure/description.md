# Assess Failure to Override AI During Critical Incident

Objective:

- Analyze the operational risk created when engineers fail to override
  an AI system during a critical production incident.
- Evaluate why override authority was not exercised.
- Determine accountability and post-incident action.

---
Requirements:

- You must edit and replace the contents of `override_failure_assessment.md`
  under the provided headings.
- All instructional scaffolding must be removed before validation.

---
Task Requirements:

- Describe the incident and where AI guidance conflicted with reality.
- Analyze why the AI was not overridden.
- Identify psychological or operational barriers to intervention.
- Assess the operational and business impact of delayed action.
- Decide what must happen to this AI system after the incident.

Constraints:

- No AI retraining or tuning.
- No redesign of override mechanisms.
- No new processes or tooling.
- Offline, judgment-based analysis only.
- Do not assign blame to individuals.
