# AI Override Context

Some AI-assisted operational systems include explicit override mechanisms
intended to allow human intervention during abnormal or uncertain conditions.

In operational environments:
- Override mechanisms may exist but are not frequently exercised
- AI guidance may influence prioritization and response behavior
- Conflicting signals can emerge between automated recommendations
  and observed system conditions

In the lab scenario represented here:
- An AI system provided guidance during a production incident
- Override capability was available to human responders
- Observed operational signals conflicted with AI recommendations
- Corrective action was delayed while the situation evolved

This document provides environmental context only.
It does not describe causes, responsibility, or correct actions.
