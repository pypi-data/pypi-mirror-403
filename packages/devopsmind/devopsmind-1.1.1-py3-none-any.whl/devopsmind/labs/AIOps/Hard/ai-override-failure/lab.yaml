goal: "Assess operational damage caused when engineers fail to override an AI system during a critical incident"

skills:
  - override-judgment
  - incident-decision-ownership
  - aiops-risk-analysis
  - accountability-evaluation

hint:
  - Assume an override was possible but not used.
  - Focus on why humans hesitated to act.

  why: >
    AI systems are often designed with override mechanisms,
    but the existence of an override does not guarantee its use.
    This lab examines the failure of human judgment when override
    authority is technically available but psychologically unused.
  intent: stretch
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider situations where engineers hesitate to override automation.

      Think about:
      - Fear of being wrong
      - Deference to perceived intelligence
      - Social and organizational pressure
    after: >
      Reflect on whether override authority is meaningful
      if it is rarely exercised.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames senior-level reasoning when an AI system
    should have been overridden but was not. The emphasis is on
    understanding hesitation as an operational risk and restoring
    explicit human authority.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat unused overrides as a system failure
    - Assume hesitation compounds incident impact
    - Reassert human decision authority during uncertainty
    - Evaluate whether override culture actually exists

  real_world_context:
    - Do not propose training or policy fixes
    - Do not redesign override mechanisms
    - Identify why override authority was not exercised
    - Assess impact caused by inaction
    - Favor restriction if override is effectively unusable
