  why: >
    AI systems fail differently than traditional software.
    This lab trains engineers to analyze, contain, and respond
    when an AIOps agent produces incorrect or misleading output.
  intent: stretch
  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how failures are handled in real incident response
      when tooling provides incorrect or uncertain information.

      Optional manual inspection (not required for validation):
      - Review incident timelines, logs, or agent output using read-only tools
      - Correlate reported signals with observed system behavior
      - cat / less / grep for understanding only
    after: >
      Reflect on how AI uncertainty changes operational risk management.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution is intended to frame expert-level judgment when
    analyzing AI or agent-driven incidents. The focus is on how
    engineers reason about trust, containment, and accountability,
    rather than prescribing steps or fixes.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat agent output as probabilistic rather than authoritative
    - Prioritize containment before attempting correction
    - Preserve explicit human accountability throughout the incident
    - Emphasize system safeguards over individual error or blame

  real_world_context:
    - Avoid prescribing exact steps or remediation playbooks
    - Do not attempt to optimize or retrain the AI model itself
    - Clearly identify how trust in the agent failed
    - Assess operational impact realistically
    - Favor containment actions that limit blast radius
    - Anchor preventive measures in system and architecture design
