# Post-Incident Trust Context

In some operational environments, AI systems are trusted
based on historical performance or prior reliability.

After incidents occur:
- Continued use becomes an explicit decision
- Risk exposure may change
- Human decision-makers retain authority over trust

In the lab scenario represented here:
- An AI system was involved in a production incident
- A failure was identified and confirmed
- Human responders retained authority to continue or revoke use

This document provides environmental context only.
It does not describe causes, responsibility, or correct actions.
