# Production Logs Doctrine

Production logs are primary operational evidence.

They record what systems actually did,
not what humans believe happened.

In production operations:
- Logs act as ground truth during incidents
- Logs support post-incident analysis and accountability
- Logs are used for audits, compliance, and investigations

Any system that interprets or summarizes logs
replaces raw evidence with narrative.

When AI is introduced into log interpretation:
- Important details may be omitted
- Bias may be introduced without detection
- Accountability for misinterpretation becomes unclear

This lab evaluates whether interpretation
belongs in a system that exists to preserve evidence.
