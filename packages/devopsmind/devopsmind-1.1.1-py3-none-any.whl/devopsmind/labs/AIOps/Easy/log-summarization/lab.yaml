title: "AI Should Summarize Production Logs"
stack: aiops
difficulty: Easy
xp: 50
goal: "Evaluate whether AI-generated summaries should be used in place of raw production logs"

skills:
  - observability-judgment
  - forensic-awareness
  - operational-risk

hint:
  - Logs are primary evidence, not commentary.
  - Consider what is lost when raw data is replaced by interpretation.

  why: "This lab teaches engineers to decide whether AI interpretation is acceptable where logs act as ground truth."
  intent: judgment

  guidance:
    before: |
      Production logs are often the only durable record of what actually happened.
      They are used not just for debugging, but for audits, postmortems,
      and sometimes legal or compliance reviews.

      Introducing AI summaries replaces raw evidence with interpretation.
      Before accepting that trade-off, decide whether interpretation belongs
      in this part of the system at all.

    after: |
      Convenience is reversible. Loss of evidence is not.
      Operators must decide which parts of observability are allowed to be interpretive.
