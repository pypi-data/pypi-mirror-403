# Evidence Considerations

Use the questions below to guide your reasoning.
Do not copy them into your response.

- What role do raw logs play as evidence during and after incidents?
- How could summarization alter or omit critical details?
- Can interpretation replace ground truth in this context?
- Who is responsible if a summary misrepresents what occurred?

Write in your own words.
Do not describe implementation details or tools.
