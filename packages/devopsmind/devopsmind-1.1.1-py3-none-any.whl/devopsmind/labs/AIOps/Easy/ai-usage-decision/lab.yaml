goal: "Evaluate whether AI should be used in an operations scenario"

  - aiops-fundamentals
  - system-design
  - engineering-judgment
  - risk-awareness

hint: "Not every problem needs AI. Focus on risk, determinism, and operational safety."

  why: >
    This lab teaches engineers to critically evaluate AI usage in operations.
    Industry-grade AIOps starts with knowing when NOT to use AI.
  intent: foundation
  guidance:
    before: |
      Think like an SRE reviewing a proposal. Ask what could go wrong,
      what is deterministic, and who remains accountable.

      Optional manual inspection (not required for validation):
      - Review sample logs or metrics using read-only tools
      - Inspect configuration artifacts for determinism and safety
      - cat / less / grep / jq for understanding only
    after: >
      Compare AI-based solutions with deterministic alternatives and evaluate
      operational trade-offs.
