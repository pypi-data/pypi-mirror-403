# AI Usage Doctrine (Foundational)

AI systems are not neutral upgrades.
They introduce uncertainty, opacity, and new failure modes.

In operational engineering:
- Deterministic systems are preferred when possible
- Predictability reduces operational risk
- Accountability must always remain human-owned

This doctrine establishes a baseline principle:

AI should only be used when its benefits clearly outweigh
the operational risk it introduces.

This lab evaluates that judgment.
