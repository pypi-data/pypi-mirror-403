# Decide Where AI Belongs

Objective:

- Decide whether AI is appropriate for a given operational problem.
- Apply basic engineering judgment around determinism, risk, and accountability.
- Issue a clear decision that prioritizes operational safety.

---
Requirements:

- You must edit and replace the contents of `decision.md`
  under the provided headings.
- All placeholder guidance must be removed before validation.

---
Task Requirements:

- Decide whether AI should be used in the given scenario.
- Justify the decision using operational reasoning.
- Identify realistic risks if AI is introduced.
- Propose a deterministic, non-AI alternative solution.

---
Constraints:

- No AI execution or autonomous behavior.
- No automation or system design.
- No cloud services or external dependencies.
- Offline reasoning only.
- Human accountability must be preserved.
