  why: "This lab teaches engineers to decide whether probabilistic AI forecasts belong in capacity planning decisions."
  intent: judgment

  guidance:
    before: |
      Capacity planning affects cost, performance, and reliability.
      Decisions made here often commit the organization
      months or years into the future.

      AI can offer predictions, but predictions are not guarantees.
      Before relying on AI forecasts, decide whether uncertainty
      is acceptable in this decision path.

    after: |
      Automation is safest where mistakes are reversible.
      Capacity planning rarely offers that luxury.
