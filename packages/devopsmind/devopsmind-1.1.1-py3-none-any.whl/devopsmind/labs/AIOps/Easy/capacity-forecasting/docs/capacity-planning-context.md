# Capacity Planning Context

Capacity planning determines how much infrastructure
an organization provisions to meet future demand.

Capacity decisions affect:
- Infrastructure spend and long-term contracts
- Performance and latency under load
- Reliability and SLA commitments
- Customer trust and experience

In this lab scenario:
- Capacity planning is currently manual
- AI is proposed to forecast future demand
- Forecasts may influence provisioning and commitments

This document provides operational context only.
It does not recommend approving or rejecting AI forecasting.
