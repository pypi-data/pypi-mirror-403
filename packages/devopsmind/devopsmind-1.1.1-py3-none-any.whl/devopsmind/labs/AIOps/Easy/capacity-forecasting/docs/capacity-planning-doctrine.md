# Capacity Planning Doctrine

Capacity planning decisions commit organizations to future cost,
performance, and reliability outcomes.

In operations:
- Forecasts are probabilistic, not guarantees
- Capacity decisions are often slow or expensive to reverse
- Errors compound over time rather than failing immediately

When AI systems are used in capacity planning:
- Uncertainty may be mistaken for confidence
- Accountability may become blurred
- Long-term commitments may be made based on predictions

This lab evaluates whether probabilistic AI forecasts
belong in decisions with limited reversibility
and long-lasting operational impact.
