# Incident Postmortems and Accountability Context

Incident postmortems document what happened, why it happened,
and what responsibility the organization accepts as a result.

In this lab scenario:
- A significant incident has occurred
- A formal postmortem is required
- AI is proposed to draft the initial narrative

Postmortems are used for:
- Learning and prevention
- Leadership and management review
- Compliance and audit processes
- Customer or partner communication

Known operational risks:
- Narrative framing that minimizes responsibility
- Omission of uncomfortable details
- Ambiguity about authorship
- Reduced trust in official records
