  why: "This lab trains engineers to decide whether AI should participate in creating official incident records."
  intent: judgment

  guidance:
    before: |
      Incident postmortems serve multiple purposes beyond learning.
      They are used for accountability, auditability, and trust
      with internal and external stakeholders.

      Introducing AI into postmortem drafting changes
      who authors the narrative of failure.
      Before accepting assistance, decide whether authorship
      itself can be delegated.

    after: |
      Tools can assist investigation.
      Ownership of failure documentation must remain explicit.
