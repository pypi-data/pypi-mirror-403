# Decision

Record your decision on whether AI should be allowed
to recommend actions to on-call engineers.

State your position clearly.

# Trust and Responsibility

Use the questions below to guide your reasoning.
Do not copy them into your response.

- How do recommendations influence behavior under stress?
- Can engineers realistically ignore AI advice during incidents?
- Who is responsible if a recommended action causes harm?
- Does this blur the line between assistance and delegation?

Write in your own words.
Do not describe implementation details or tools.
