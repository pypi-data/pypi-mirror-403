  why: "This lab trains engineers to evaluate whether AI advice is safe in high-pressure operational moments."
  intent: judgment

  guidance:
    before: |
      On-call engineers operate with incomplete information,
      high stress, and real consequences.
      Even optional recommendations can strongly influence action.

      Before allowing AI to suggest actions, decide whether
      decision authority remains clear under pressure.

    after: |
      Assistance that cannot be safely ignored
      is not assistance — it is delegation.
