# AI Should Recommend Actions to On-Call Engineers

Objective:

Decide whether an AI system should recommend actions to on-call engineers during incidents.

---
Requirements:

- You are responsible for a production system with an on-call rotation.
- During incidents:
  - Engineers operate under time pressure
  - Information is incomplete or evolving
  - Decisions can directly impact availability and customers
- A proposal suggests introducing AI to:
  - Suggest next steps during incidents
  - Recommend mitigations or rollbacks
  - Reduce decision fatigue for on-call engineers

---
Task Requirements:

- Decide whether AI should be allowed to recommend actions during incidents.
- Record a clear operational decision.
- Justify your decision based on human behavior, responsibility, and risk.

---
Constraints:

- You may not assume recommendations are always correct.
- You may not assume engineers can easily ignore suggestions.
- You may not design runbooks or workflows.
- This is a judgment decision, not a tooling exercise.
