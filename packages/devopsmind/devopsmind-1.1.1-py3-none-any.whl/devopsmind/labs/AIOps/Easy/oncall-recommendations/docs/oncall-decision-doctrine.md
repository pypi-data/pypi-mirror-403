# On-Call Decision Authority Doctrine

On-call engineers are the final authority during production incidents.

They are accountable for:
- System availability
- Customer impact
- Operational risk decisions

Recommendations influence behavior,
even when they are presented as optional.

In high-pressure situations:
- Humans defer to perceived expertise
- Suggestions can override instinct
- Responsibility becomes psychologically blurred

Any system that recommends actions during incidents
implicitly participates in decision-making.

This lab evaluates whether action recommendations
can exist without transferring authority.
