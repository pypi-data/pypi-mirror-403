# Decision

Record your decision regarding the use of AI for incident classification.

Choose one position and state it clearly.

# Justification

Use the questions below to guide your thinking.
You do not need to answer them individually, but your reasoning should address them.

- Who is accountable if an incident is classified incorrectly?
- How does misclassification affect response urgency and escalation?
- Can this decision fail silently during high-pressure incidents?
- Does introducing AI strengthen or weaken operational ownership?

Write in your own words.
Do not repeat these questions in your answer.
Do not describe implementation details or tooling.
