  why: "This lab teaches engineers to decide whether AI should exist in an incident workflow at all."
  intent: judgment

  guidance:
    before: |
      Incident classification determines urgency, ownership, and response order.
      Introducing AI adds probabilistic behavior to a decision
      that is often assumed to be deterministic.

      Before evaluating performance, decide whether this responsibility
      can be safely delegated at all.

    after: |
      In production systems, accountability matters more than convenience.
      Some decisions must remain human-owned by design.
