# Incident Classification in Production Operations

Incident classification is the process of determining the nature and severity
of a production issue so that the correct response path is triggered.

## What Classification Influences
- Alert priority and paging urgency
- Escalation paths and responder ownership
- Communication to stakeholders and customers
- Post-incident reporting and accountability

## Why Teams Consider Automation
- High alert volume during peak incidents
- Fatigue and inconsistency across on-call shifts
- Pressure to reduce mean time to acknowledge (MTTA)

## Known Operational Risks
- Misclassification can delay critical response
- Incorrect severity may suppress escalation
- Silent misclassification can go unnoticed during fast-moving outages
- Accountability may become unclear when decisions are automated
