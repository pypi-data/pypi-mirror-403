State your position clearly.

# Risk Assessment

Use the questions below to guide your reasoning.
Do not copy them into your answer.

- What operational signals might be lost or obscured?
- How could alert merging affect situational awareness during incidents?
- Can alert suppression create false confidence or delayed response?
- Who remains accountable if important alerts are hidden?

Write in your own words.
Do not describe implementation details or tools.
