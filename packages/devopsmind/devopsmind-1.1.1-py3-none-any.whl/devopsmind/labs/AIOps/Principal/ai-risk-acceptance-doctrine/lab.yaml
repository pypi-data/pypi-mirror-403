  why: >
    At Principal level, engineers must decide
    which risks the organization is willing to live with,
    and publicly own when they materialize.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - Risks that align with organizational values
      - Exposure that can be defended after failure

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can define
    a clear, defensible doctrine for AI risks the
    organization knowingly and permanently accepts.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat risk acceptance as irreversible commitment
    - Focus on ownership, not reduction
    - Define justification that survives failure
    - Assign enduring accountability

  real_world_context:
    - No remediation is acceptable
    - No future safeguards are assumed
    - Decisions must stand after public and regulatory review
