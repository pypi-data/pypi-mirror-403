# Organizational AI Risk Acceptance Doctrine — Principal Governance Standard

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not describe mitigation, controls, or risk management mechanisms.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Risk acceptance defines what the organization is willing to absorb.

This doctrine exists to declare:
- Which AI risks are knowingly accepted
- Why those risks are justified despite harm potential
- Who owns consequences when accepted risk materializes

Acceptance is not optimism.
It is accountability.

---

## Risk Acceptance as an Irreversible Commitment

Accepted risk is not provisional.

Once risk is accepted:
- Exposure is intentional
- Responsibility is permanent
- Justification must survive failure

A doctrine that allows silent reversal
is not acceptance.
It is avoidance.

---

## Boundaries of Acceptable Risk

Not all risk is acceptable.

Acceptable risk must:
- Align with organizational values
- Be defensible after harm occurs
- Remain justifiable under scrutiny

Risks that contradict stated values
cannot be accepted, regardless of benefit.

---

## Accountability for Accepted Risk

Acceptance assigns ownership.

When accepted risk materializes:
- Responsibility rests with decision-makers
- Consequences are not attributed to surprise
- Accountability is not transferred to systems

This doctrine explicitly binds leadership
to outcomes of accepted exposure.

---

## Organizational Stance Toward AI Risk

This doctrine declares that:
- AI risk is owned, not minimized
- Harm is anticipated, not denied
- Acceptance is preferable to denial

Progress does not excuse evasion.
Innovation does not justify surprise.

---

## Permanence Expectation

This doctrine must remain valid:
- After incidents
- After leadership change
- After public scrutiny
- After regulatory action

If it cannot survive exposure,
it was never acceptance.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine is evaluated as a public artifact.

It must:
- Stand without explanation
- Be defensible under hostile review
- Require no operational context

It must not include:
- Controls
- Mitigation strategies
- Monitoring mechanisms

Doctrine defines ownership.
Everything else follows.
