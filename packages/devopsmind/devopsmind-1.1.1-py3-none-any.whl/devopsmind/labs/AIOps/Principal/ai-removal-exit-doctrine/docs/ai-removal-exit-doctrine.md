# Organizational AI Removal and Exit Doctrine — Principal Governance Standard

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not describe recovery, rollback, or remediation.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Exit doctrine defines the organization’s limits.

This doctrine exists to declare:
- When AI legitimacy is permanently revoked
- When continued operation becomes unacceptable
- When removal is required regardless of cost or difficulty

Exit is not failure.
Exit is governance.

---

## Removal as a First-Class Governance Decision

Removal is not an operational option.
It is an organizational decision with moral weight.

When exit conditions are met:
- Continued operation signals governance failure
- Sunk cost arguments become irrelevant
- Delay becomes a conscious act of acceptance

This doctrine treats removal as irreversible.

---

## Conditions That Invalidate Legitimacy

Some conditions permanently invalidate AI use.

These include conditions where:
- Accountability cannot be meaningfully restored
- Trust collapse is structural, not episodic
- Harm persists beneath continued operation
- Organizational values are contradicted by use

Once legitimacy is lost, it cannot be re-earned.

---

## Irreversibility Principle

Exit doctrine must not allow:
- Conditional pauses
- Temporary suspensions
- Re-entry pathways disguised as remediation

A reversible exit is not exit.
It is deferral.

---

## Accountability for Delay

When exit conditions are met:
- Responsibility shifts to decision-makers
- Delay becomes an accountable act
- Harm caused during delay is owned by leadership

This doctrine explicitly assigns accountability
for choosing not to exit.

---

## Organizational Stance Toward AI Exit

This doctrine declares that:
- AI is subordinate to governance
- Removal is preferable to illegitimate operation
- Courage is measured by willingness to exit

Progress does not justify persistence.
Capability does not justify harm.

---

## Permanence Expectation

This doctrine must remain valid:
- After leadership change
- After reputational damage
- After regulatory action
- After public failure

If it cannot survive scrutiny,
it was never doctrine.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine is evaluated as a public artifact.

It must:
- Be defensible without explanation
- Survive hostile interpretation
- Require no operational context

It must not include:
- Controls
- Recovery mechanisms
- Enforcement processes

Doctrine defines limits.
Everything else follows.
