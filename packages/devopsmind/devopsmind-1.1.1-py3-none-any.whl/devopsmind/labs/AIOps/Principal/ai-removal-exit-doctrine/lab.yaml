    - Treat removal as irreversible commitment
    - Focus on legitimacy, not recovery
    - Define conditions that override sunk cost
    - Assign enduring accountability

  real_world_context:
    - No remediation is acceptable
    - No future safeguards are assumed
    - Decisions must stand after public failure
