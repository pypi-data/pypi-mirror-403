  why: >
    At Principal level, engineers must define which failures
    the organization will not justify, excuse, or tolerate.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - Failures that destroy legitimacy
      - Harm that cannot be offset by success elsewhere

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can define
    a clear, defensible doctrine for AI failures that
    invalidate continued operation or adoption.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat unacceptable failure as absolute
    - Focus on legitimacy, not recovery
    - Define non-negotiable harm
    - Assign enduring accountability

  real_world_context:
    - No remediation is acceptable
    - No future safeguards are assumed
    - Decisions must stand after public failure
