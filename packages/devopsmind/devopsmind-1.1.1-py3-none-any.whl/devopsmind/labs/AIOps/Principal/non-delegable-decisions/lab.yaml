  why: >
    At Principal level, engineers must draw absolute lines
    around decisions that define accountability and legitimacy.
  intent: judge

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can define
    a clear, defensible doctrine for decisions that
    must remain permanently human-owned.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat non-delegation as governance commitment
    - Focus on legitimacy and accountability
    - Define unacceptable automation explicitly
    - Assign enduring responsibility

  real_world_context:
    - No remediation is acceptable
    - No future safeguards are assumed
    - Decisions must stand after public and legal scrutiny
