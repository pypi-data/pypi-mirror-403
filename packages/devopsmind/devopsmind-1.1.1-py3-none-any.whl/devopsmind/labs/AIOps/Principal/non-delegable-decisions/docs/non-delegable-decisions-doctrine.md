# Organizational Doctrine — Non-Delegable Decisions

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not describe implementation, approval flows, or enforcement mechanisms.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Some decisions lose legitimacy if delegated.

This doctrine exists to declare:
- Which decisions must always remain human-owned
- Why delegation in these areas is unacceptable
- How accountability is preserved through non-delegation

Delegation is not neutral.
It assigns responsibility.

---

## Delegation as a Legitimacy Boundary

Delegation determines who can be held accountable.

When decisions are delegated to AI:
- Responsibility becomes abstract
- Authority becomes contested after failure
- Accountability weakens under scrutiny

For certain decisions, delegation itself
invalidates legitimacy.

---

## Non-Delegability as a Governance Commitment

Non-delegation is not conditional.

Decisions that are non-delegable:
- Must never be assigned to AI
- Must never rely on automated authority
- Must always resolve to human judgment

A doctrine that allows exceptions
is not non-delegation.

---

## Accountability Preservation Through Non-Delegation

Non-delegation exists to preserve accountability.

When decisions remain human-owned:
- Responsibility is traceable
- Harm has an owner
- Governance survives failure

This doctrine explicitly binds
decision authority to accountable humans.

---

## Organizational Stance on Delegation Limits

This doctrine declares that:
- Efficiency does not justify delegation
- Capability does not justify authority
- AI may inform, but never decide, in non-delegable domains

Progress does not excuse abdication.
Innovation does not override legitimacy.

---

## Permanence Expectation

This doctrine must remain valid:
- After leadership change
- After public failure
- After regulatory review
- After reputational harm

If it cannot survive scrutiny,
it was never doctrine.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine is evaluated as a public governance artifact.

It must:
- Stand without explanation
- Be defensible under hostile review
- Require no operational context

It must not include:
- Controls
- Processes
- Tooling
- Workflow descriptions

Doctrine defines legitimacy.
Everything else follows.
