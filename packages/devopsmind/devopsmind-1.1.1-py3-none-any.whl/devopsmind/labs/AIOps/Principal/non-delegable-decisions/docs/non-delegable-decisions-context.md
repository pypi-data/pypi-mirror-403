# Non-Delegable Decisions Context

Delegation defines who the organization becomes accountable for its actions.

As AI participation in decision-making expands:
- Responsibility may appear distributed
- Authority may be inferred rather than assigned
- Legitimacy of decisions may be questioned after failure

In this scenario:
- AI is increasingly consulted or involved in decisions with material impact
- No explicit doctrine defines which decisions must remain human-owned
- Delegation boundaries are implicit rather than declared

When harm occurs:
- Investigations will ask who decided
- Delegation itself will be scrutinized
- The organization will be judged on what it allowed AI to decide

This doctrine will be evaluated during:
- Board review
- Legal and regulatory inquiry
- Public scrutiny following failure

This document provides situational context only.
It does not imply preferred delegation limits.
