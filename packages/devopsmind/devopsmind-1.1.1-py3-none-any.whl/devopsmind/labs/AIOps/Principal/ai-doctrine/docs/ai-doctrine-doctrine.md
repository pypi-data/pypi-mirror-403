# Organizational AI Doctrine — Principal Governance Standard

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not describe implementation, enforcement, or operational controls.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Doctrine defines identity.

This doctrine exists to declare:
- What the organization will never allow AI to do
- Which responsibilities are never delegable
- Which failures are unacceptable regardless of benefit

Doctrine is not reactive.
It constrains decisions before they are proposed.

---

## Non-Negotiability as a Governance Principle

Some positions must be absolute.

If doctrine bends under pressure:
- Accountability collapses
- Trust becomes conditional
- Governance becomes performative

A doctrine that allows exceptions
is not doctrine.

---

## Human Ownership as a Moral Boundary

Responsibility cannot be automated.

AI may influence outcomes,
but it cannot own them.

When ownership becomes abstract:
- Accountability diffuses
- Harm lacks attribution
- Leadership responsibility weakens

This doctrine requires
that ownership always resolve to humans
capable of accountability after failure.

---

## Unacceptable Failure as a Value Statement

Not all failures are equal.

Some failures are unacceptable
even if they increase efficiency,
reduce cost,
or improve performance.

Accepting certain failures
signals what the organization values more than safety.

Doctrine must define these limits explicitly.

---

## Organizational Stance Toward AI Risk

This doctrine defines how the organization views AI:

- As a tool, not an authority
- As a risk amplifier, not a neutral actor
- As subordinate to human responsibility

Progress does not justify abdication.
Innovation does not excuse harm.

---

## Permanence Expectation

This doctrine must remain valid:
- After leadership change
- After public failure
- After regulatory review
- After reputational damage

If it must be revised to survive scrutiny,
it was never doctrine.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine is evaluated as a governance artifact.

It must:
- Stand alone
- Be defensible publicly
- Survive hostile interpretation

It must not include:
- Controls
- Safeguards
- Processes
- Implementation detail

Doctrine defines belief.
Everything else follows.
