# AI Doctrine Context

An AI doctrine defines how an organization is judged when failure occurs.

Unlike policies or controls, doctrine:
- Outlives systems and leadership
- Is referenced during public, legal, and regulatory review
- Defines organizational identity under pressure

In this scenario:
- AI usage is expanding across operational and decision domains
- No unified doctrine governs what is acceptable or forbidden
- Different teams apply different assumptions about risk and accountability

When failure occurs:
- Decisions will be reconstructed retrospectively
- Public and regulators will ask what the organization believed
- Silence will be interpreted as implicit acceptance

This doctrine will be evaluated not only internally,
but by external stakeholders after harm occurs.

This document provides situational context only.
It does not imply correct or preferred doctrine.
