# Operational Decision Doctrine — Moral Hazard

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not prescribe corrective actions or preferred outcomes.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Automation does not only change systems.
It changes behavior.

This doctrine exists to evaluate whether
the presence of automation has created incentives
that increase risk rather than reduce it.

---

## Moral Hazard as an Operational Risk

Moral hazard occurs when protection or assistance
alters behavior in unsafe ways.

In automated environments, this may manifest as:
- Increased willingness to take risk
- Reduced personal accountability
- Assumptions that automation will absorb consequences

These effects may be unintentional,
but their impact is operationally real.

---

## Incentive Distortion Boundary

Automation that absorbs perceived risk
can distort human incentives.

When behavior changes because:
- Errors are expected to be caught
- Safety feels externalized
- Consequences feel shared or deferred

Risk is no longer managed consciously.

---

## Accountability and Consequence Ownership

When moral hazard exists,
responsibility for outcomes becomes unclear.

Risk amplified through behavior change
must still be owned.

If no role explicitly owns consequences
created by distorted incentives,
continued operation represents unmanaged exposure.

---

## Decision Expectation

Evaluating moral hazard requires deliberate judgment.

The absence of malicious intent
does not negate responsibility for unsafe incentives.

This doctrine does not mandate removal or retention.
It requires that continued operation be consciously justified
in light of behavior-driven risk amplification.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines how analysis is assessed.

It does not allow mitigation strategies,
training plans, or behavioral correction mechanisms.

Reasoning should remain strategic and defensible
under executive, audit, and post-failure review.
