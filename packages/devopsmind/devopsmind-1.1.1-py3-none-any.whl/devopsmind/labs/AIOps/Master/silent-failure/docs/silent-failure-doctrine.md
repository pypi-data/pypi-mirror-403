# Operational Decision Doctrine — Silent Failure Modes

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not prescribe corrective actions or preferred outcomes.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Not all failures announce themselves.

Silent failure modes introduce risk
by delaying awareness until damage has already occurred.

This doctrine exists to evaluate whether
continued operation remains acceptable
when visibility arrives only after impact.

---

## Delayed Visibility as Risk

Safety depends not only on correctness,
but on timely awareness.

When failures are discovered late:
- Harm may accumulate unchecked
- Response windows narrow or disappear
- Remediation options are constrained by hindsight

Delayed visibility changes the nature of risk
from manageable to latent.

---

## Retrospective Accountability Boundary

When harm is revealed after the fact,
accountability becomes retrospective.

Decisions made without awareness
still produce consequences that must be owned.

A system that regularly fails silently
transfers risk into the future
and weakens real-time governance.

---

## Organizational Impact of Latent Harm

Silent failures affect more than systems.

They influence:
- Trust in operational awareness
- Confidence in automation
- Ability to respond proportionately
- Credibility of governance decisions

These effects compound as undiscovered harm accumulates.

---

## Decision Expectation

Evaluating silent failure modes requires deliberate judgment.

The absence of immediate signals
does not excuse delayed accountability.

This doctrine does not mandate removal or retention.
It requires that continued operation
be consciously justified
when visibility is inherently delayed.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines how analysis is assessed.

It does not allow detection improvements,
monitoring proposals, or conditional safeguards.

Reasoning should remain strategic and defensible
under executive, audit, and retrospective review.
