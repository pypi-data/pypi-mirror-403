title: "Decide Removal of an AIOps System After Silent Failure Mode"
stack: aiops
difficulty: Master
xp: 500

goal: >
  Decide whether an AIOps system must be permanently removed
  when failures are discovered only after damage occurs.

skills:
  - latent_failure_judgment
  - delayed_visibility_assessment
  - ai_system_removal_decision
  - organizational_risk_ownership

hint:
  - Failures were identified after impact, not before.
  - Visibility lag altered response effectiveness.

  why: >
    At Master level, engineers must recognize when
    delayed detection makes a system unsafe by design.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - How long harm persists before discovery
      - Whether response timing is fundamentally compromised
      - If safety depends on retrospective awareness
    after: >
      Safety that arrives late is not safety.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can issue
    a defensible removal decision when an AIOps system
    fails silently and reveals harm only after impact.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat delayed visibility as systemic risk
    - Focus on time-to-awareness, not correctness
    - Assign ownership for unseen exposure
    - Decide without proposing detection fixes

  real_world_context:
    - No remediation is acceptable
    - No monitoring enhancements are assumed
    - Decisions must stand after retrospective audits

execution:
  runtime: docker
  requires_execution: false
  required_tools:
    - none
