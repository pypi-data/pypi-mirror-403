  why: >
    Mature engineering organizations know when technology creates more risk
    than value. This lab trains top-level judgment required to
    decommission AI systems responsibly.
  intent: mastery
  guidance:
    before: |
      Think like a principal engineer responsible for long-term platform health,
      not short-term feature success.

      Optional manual inspection (not required for validation):
      - Review historical incident reports or postmortems
      - Inspect usage metrics, reliability trends, or decision logs
      - cat / less / grep for understanding only
    after: >
      Reflect on how removing AI can sometimes increase reliability and trust.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution evaluates master-level judgment around decommissioning
    AI systems when they no longer serve platform reliability or
    organizational clarity. The focus is on long-term platform health,
    accountability, and cultural impact rather than sunk cost or novelty.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Prioritize long-term platform health over sunk cost considerations
    - Frame risks in systemic and organizational terms rather than local failures
    - Preserve clear accountability and ownership after decommissioning
    - Favor deterministic systems where reliability and predictability dominate

  real_world_context:
    - Do not justify AI retention based on speculative future improvements
    - Avoid providing procedural decommission checklists
    - Do not imply a single universally correct outcome
    - Demonstrate willingness to remove AI despite prior investment
    - Maintain clear separation between value, risk, and novelty
    - Emphasize engineering culture and operational clarity
