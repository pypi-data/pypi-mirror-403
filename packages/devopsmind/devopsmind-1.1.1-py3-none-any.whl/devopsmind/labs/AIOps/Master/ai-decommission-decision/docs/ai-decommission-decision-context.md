# AIOps Decommission Context

The organization operates an AIOps system that provides guidance
during operational and incident-response activities.

The system has been in production for an extended period and is
integrated into day-to-day workflows for some teams, while others
engage with it inconsistently or avoid it entirely.

Over time:
- Perceived value has varied across teams
- Trust in recommendations is uneven
- Engineers differ in how much weight they give AI output

The system continues to incur operational and maintenance cost.
Its presence also affects engineering behavior during incidents
and routine operations.

No formal decision has been made regarding long-term retention,
scope reduction, or full removal of the system.

This document provides situational context only.
It does not imply a preferred decision.
