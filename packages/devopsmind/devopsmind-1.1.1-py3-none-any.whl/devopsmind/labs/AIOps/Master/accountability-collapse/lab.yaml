stack: aiops
difficulty: Master
xp: 500

goal: >
  Decide whether an AIOps system must be permanently removed
  when accountability for its decisions has collapsed.

skills:
  - accountability_judgment
  - governance_failure_detection
  - ai_system_removal_decision
  - organizational_risk_ownership

hint:
  - No single role clearly owns outcomes.
  - Responsibility shifts informally after failures.

mentor:
  why: >
    At Master level, engineers must recognize when
    lack of accountability makes continued operation unsafe.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - How decisions are defended after failure
      - Whether ownership exists only in theory
      - Who absorbs blame when outcomes are harmful
    after: >
      Systems without ownership eventually fail the organization.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can issue
    a defensible removal decision when accountability
    for an AIOps system’s outcomes has collapsed.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat accountability gaps as governance failure
    - Focus on ownership, not intent
    - Assign responsibility for continued exposure
    - Decide without proposing structural fixes

  real_world_context:
    - No remediation is acceptable
    - No role clarification is assumed
    - Decisions must stand after post-incident review
