# Cumulative Harm Context

In some operational environments, automated systems introduce
small, low-severity issues that are tolerated individually.

Over time, these issues may:
- Recur frequently
- Interrupt workflows
- Create minor but persistent friction
- Influence how engineers perceive reliability

In this scenario:
- An AIOps system has not caused a single critical failure
- Multiple low-impact issues have been observed over time
- Each incident was considered acceptable in isolation

As these events accumulated:
- Engineers adapted their behavior
- Reliability concerns became normalized
- Responsibility for long-term exposure became unclear

The system remains operational.
No formal decision has been made regarding continued use.

This document provides situational context only.
It does not imply a preferred outcome.
