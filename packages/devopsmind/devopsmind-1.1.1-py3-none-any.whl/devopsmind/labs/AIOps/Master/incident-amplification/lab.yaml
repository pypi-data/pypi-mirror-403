title: "Decide Removal of an AIOps System After Incident Amplification"
stack: aiops
difficulty: Master
xp: 500

goal: >
  Decide whether an AIOps system must be permanently removed
  after it amplified operational incidents.

skills:
  - incident_impact_judgment
  - blast_radius_evaluation
  - ai_system_removal_decision
  - organizational_risk_ownership

hint:
  - Incidents were survivable before automation.
  - Automation increased speed or reach of failure.

  why: >
    At Master level, engineers must recognize when
    automation accelerates harm rather than containing it.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - How failure propagated faster than before
      - Whether automation removed human friction
      - If blast radius is now unacceptable
    after: >
      Speed without control magnifies failure.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can issue
    a defensible removal decision when an AIOps system
    amplifies the impact of operational incidents.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat amplification as systemic risk
    - Focus on failure propagation, not intent
    - Assign ownership for expanded blast radius
    - Decide without proposing safeguards

  real_world_context:
    - No remediation is acceptable
    - No rollback strategies are assumed
    - Decisions must stand after incident scrutiny
