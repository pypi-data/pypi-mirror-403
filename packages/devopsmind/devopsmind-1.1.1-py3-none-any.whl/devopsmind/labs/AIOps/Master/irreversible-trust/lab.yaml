  why: >
    At Master level, engineers must recognize when
    trust has become too fragile to support safe operation.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - Whether trust persists without advocacy
      - The cost of continuous justification
      - If legitimacy depends on explanation rather than confidence

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can issue
    a defensible removal decision when trust cannot
    be sustained without continuous justification.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat fragile trust as systemic risk
    - Focus on legitimacy, not reassurance
    - Assign ownership for defended operation
    - Decide without proposing trust mechanisms

  real_world_context:
    - No trust recovery is acceptable
    - No oversight justification is assumed
    - Decisions must stand without advocacy
