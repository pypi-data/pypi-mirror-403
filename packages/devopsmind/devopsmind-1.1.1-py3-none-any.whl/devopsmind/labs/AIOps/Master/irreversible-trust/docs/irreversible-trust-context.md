# Irreversible Trust Context

In some operational environments, trust in automation
does not fail suddenly but degrades gradually.

After repeated explanations, assurances, or defenses:
- Confidence no longer exists by default
- Trust must be actively maintained
- Legitimacy depends on continuous justification

In this scenario:
- An AIOps system remains operational
- Its outputs are questioned unless explicitly defended
- Engineers rely on explanation rather than confidence

Over time:
- Use of the system requires advocacy
- Trust does not persist without reinforcement
- Operational legitimacy becomes fragile

No formal decision has been made regarding removal or retention.
The system continues to operate.

This document provides situational context only.
