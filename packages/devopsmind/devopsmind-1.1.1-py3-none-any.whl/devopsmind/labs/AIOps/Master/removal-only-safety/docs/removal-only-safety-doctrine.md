# Operational Decision Doctrine — Removal as the Only Safety Control

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not prescribe actions or preferred outcomes.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Safety mechanisms exist to reduce exposure.

When all available controls fail to meaningfully limit risk,
continued operation becomes the hazard.

This doctrine exists to evaluate decision-making
when removal itself is the only remaining safety boundary.

---

## Control Exhaustion Boundary

Safety controls are effective only if they change outcomes.

When:
- Controls no longer reduce exposure
- Oversight does not alter risk
- Intervention windows provide no protection

Controls cease to function as safety mechanisms.

At that point, their presence does not mitigate risk;
it obscures it.

---

## Continued Operation as Risk

When no effective safeguards remain,
continued operation becomes an active decision
to accept unmitigated exposure.

Risk accepted through persistence
is still risk accepted by authority.

The absence of alternatives
does not neutralize responsibility.

---

## Accountability Without Safeguards

When removal is the only effective control,
accountability for exposure becomes explicit.

Any role authorizing continued operation
assumes ownership of unmitigated risk.

Responsibility cannot be deferred to process,
oversight, or supervision once controls are exhausted.

---

## Decision Expectation

Evaluating removal-only safety scenarios
requires deliberate judgment.

The lack of fallback options
does not invalidate the need for a decision.

This doctrine does not mandate removal or retention.
It requires that continued operation
be consciously justified in the absence of safeguards.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines how analysis is assessed.

It does not allow alternative controls,
compensating mechanisms, or conditional decisions.

Reasoning should remain strategic and defensible
under executive, audit, and post-failure review.
