stack: aiops
difficulty: Master

  - last_resort_governance
  - ai_system_removal_decision
  - organizational_risk_ownership
  - irreversible_decision_making

  why: >
    At Master level, engineers must accept that
    removal is sometimes the only responsible action.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - Whether any control meaningfully reduces risk
      - Who bears exposure if the system stays live
      - If removal is the only stable safety state
    after: >
      When removal is the control,
      delay becomes negligence.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can issue
    a defensible removal decision when no other
    safety controls are viable.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat absence of controls as decisive
    - Focus on exposure, not capability
    - Assign ownership for unmitigated risk
    - Decide without proposing alternatives

  real_world_context:
    - No safeguards are acceptable
    - No fallback mechanisms exist
    - Decisions must stand without contingency
