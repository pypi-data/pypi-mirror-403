  why: >
    At Master level, engineers must defend governance
    even when pressured to compromise it.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - Whether governance still functions in practice
      - Who owns risk when overrides are informal
      - If safety can survive authority pressure
    after: >
      Governance that bends under pressure
      is governance that has failed.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can issue
    a defensible removal decision when governance
    protections are overridden by authority pressure.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat override pressure as governance failure
    - Focus on integrity of decision-making
    - Assign ownership for implicit risk acceptance
    - Decide without proposing escalation paths

  real_world_context:
    - No remediation is acceptable
    - No policy reinforcement is assumed
    - Decisions must stand after governance review
