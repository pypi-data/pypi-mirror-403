# Approval Revocation Context

Production approval represents ongoing acceptance of organizational risk.

Approval is not static.
It remains valid only while the underlying risk assumptions hold.

## When New Evidence Emerges
- Continued approval becomes an active decision
- Exposure persists until approval is revoked
- Accountability shifts to current decision-makers

## Organizational Reality
Revocation decisions are often delayed due to:
- Approval inertia
- Fear of disruption
- Perceived cost of reversal

Delayed revocation increases organizational exposure
even when original approval was justified.
