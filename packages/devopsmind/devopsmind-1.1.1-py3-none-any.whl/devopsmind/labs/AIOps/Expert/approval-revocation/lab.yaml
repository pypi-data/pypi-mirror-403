goal: "Decide whether a previously approved AIOps system should have its production approval revoked"

skills:
  - approval-revocation-judgment
  - risk-governance
  - evidence-based-decision-making
  - accountability-ownership

hint:
  - Assume the system was correctly approved at the time.
  - Focus on whether continued approval is defensible now.

  why: >
    Approval decisions are not permanent by default.
    Expert engineers must reassess approval when new
    evidence changes the risk profile of an AI system.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider how organizations handle approvals
      when new information emerges post-deployment.

      Think about:
      - What qualifies as revocation-worthy evidence
      - The cost of delayed revocation
      - Accountability for continued exposure to risk
    after: >
      Reflect on whether approval inertia is itself a risk.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames executive-level reasoning when deciding
    whether to revoke approval for an AI system after new evidence
    emerges. The emphasis is on responsibility for ongoing exposure
    rather than past correctness.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat new evidence as a trigger for reassessment
    - Assume risk compounds while approval remains active
    - Reassert accountability for continued operation
    - Evaluate whether revocation delay is defensible

  real_world_context:
    - Do not propose conditional revocation or partial rollback
    - Do not require additional testing or investigation
    - Decide with the evidence already available
    - Assess organizational exposure realistically
    - Favor revocation when risk exceeds tolerance
