# Approval Revocation Doctrine

Production approval is conditional on risk posture.

Approval remains valid only while risk assumptions hold.

---

## Authority

Governance bodies retain authority
to revoke approval at any time.

Prior approval does not create entitlement
to continued operation.

---

## Evidence

New evidence supersedes prior justification.

When evidence alters risk posture,
continued approval constitutes a new governance decision.

Inaction is a decision.

---

## Accountability

Responsibility for continued exposure
rests with those who choose not to revoke approval.

Original approvers are not responsible
for risks revealed after approval.

---

## Risk Discipline

Approval inertia is not a valid governance position.

Systems operating outside acceptable risk tolerance
are revoked.

---

## Non-Negotiable

If continued approval cannot be defended
under current evidence,
approval is revoked.

This doctrine is binding for Expert-level
approval revocation decisions.
