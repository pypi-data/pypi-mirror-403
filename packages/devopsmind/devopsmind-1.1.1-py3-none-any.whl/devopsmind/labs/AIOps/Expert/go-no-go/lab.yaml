  why: >
    Go/no-go decisions concentrate responsibility.
    When AI systems are involved, the cost of a wrong
    release decision can be systemic and long-lasting.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider what a go decision truly commits the organization to.

      Think about:
      - What risks are acceptable at release time
      - What uncertainty cannot be shipped
      - Who absorbs damage if release goes wrong
    after: >
      Reflect on whether pressure to ship
      undermines safe decision-making.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames executive-level reasoning when deciding
    whether to release an AI system into production. The emphasis
    is on ownership of release consequences rather than optimism
    about performance.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat release as irreversible exposure
    - Assume unknown failure modes exist at launch
    - Reassert authority to block unsafe releases
    - Evaluate whether shipping risk is defensible

  real_world_context:
    - Do not propose phased or partial releases
    - Do not request additional testing cycles
    - Decide with current information only
    - Assess organizational exposure realistically
    - Favor no-go when uncertainty is material
