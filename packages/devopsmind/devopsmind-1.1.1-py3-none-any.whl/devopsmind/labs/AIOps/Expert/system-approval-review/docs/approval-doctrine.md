# Production Approval Doctrine

Production approval is a governance act, not a technical milestone.

An approved system represents an explicit organizational decision
to accept ongoing exposure to its failure modes.

Approval does not validate correctness.
Approval assigns responsibility.

Once granted:
- Risk is owned, not provisional
- Accountability is fixed to approvers
- Future incidents reference the approval decision

Technical readiness does not imply governance readiness.

A system may function correctly
and still be unacceptable for production use.

Approval decisions must remain defensible:
- After failure
- After personnel changes
- After context is forgotten

Conditional approval is not approval.
Deferred certainty is not safety.

If approval cannot be defended under adverse outcomes,
the system must not be approved.

This doctrine defines the minimum standard
for production approval at Expert governance level.
