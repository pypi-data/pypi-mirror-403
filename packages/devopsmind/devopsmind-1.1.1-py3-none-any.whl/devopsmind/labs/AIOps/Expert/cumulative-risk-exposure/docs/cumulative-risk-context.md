# Cumulative Risk Context

Cumulative risk emerges when repeated failures
create systemic exposure beyond individual incidents.

In operational environments:
- patterns matter more than anomalies
- tolerance erodes over time
- normalization of failure increases exposure

AI-related failures often appear survivable in isolation.

Governance responsibility lies in recognizing
when accumulated exposure becomes unacceptable.
