# Exception Approval Context

Exceptions allow systems to bypass established governance criteria.

In organizations:
- exceptions become precedents
- accountability shifts to approvers
- repeated exceptions erode controls

Business urgency frequently drives exception requests.

Exception approvals persist beyond the original context
and are reused as justification for future deviations.

This document provides context only.
It does not recommend granting or denying an exception.
