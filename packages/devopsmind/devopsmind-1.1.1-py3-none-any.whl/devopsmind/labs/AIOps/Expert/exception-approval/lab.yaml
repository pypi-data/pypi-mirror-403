  why: >
    Exceptions are where governance fails quietly.
    Expert engineers must decide whether granting an exception
    is responsible or merely convenient under pressure.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider why exceptions are requested in organizations.

      Think about:
      - Business urgency versus safety
      - Precedent set by granting exceptions
      - Accountability after an exception-caused failure
    after: >
      Reflect on whether exceptions weaken governance
      more than outright rejection.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames executive-level reasoning when deciding
    whether to grant an exception-based approval for an AI system.
    The emphasis is on precedent, accountability, and long-term
    governance integrity.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat exceptions as permanent governance signals
    - Assume exceptions normalize risk exposure
    - Reassert accountability for exception outcomes
    - Evaluate whether refusal is the safer choice

  real_world_context:
    - Do not propose time-bound or conditional exceptions
    - Do not request compensating controls
    - Decide using existing information only
    - Assess organizational precedent realistically
    - Favor denial when exceptions undermine governance
