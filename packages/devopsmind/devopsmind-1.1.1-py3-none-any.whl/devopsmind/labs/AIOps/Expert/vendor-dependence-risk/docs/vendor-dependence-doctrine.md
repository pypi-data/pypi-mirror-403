# Vendor Dependence Governance Doctrine

Vendor dependence is an operational risk, not a procurement detail.

When an AI system relies on an external vendor:
- Operational autonomy is reduced
- Failure response is partially outsourced
- Accountability does not transfer with control

Vendor dependence becomes most visible under failure,
when remediation timelines, access, and decision authority
are constrained by third parties.

An organization remains accountable for:
- Impact caused by vendor outages
- Delayed remediation due to vendor constraints
- Decisions made while dependent on vendor availability

Convenience during normal operation does not justify
loss of autonomy during failure.

A system may function correctly
and still be unacceptable due to vendor dependence.

If operational control cannot be exercised independently
when it matters most,
the system must not be considered acceptable.

This doctrine defines the standard
for evaluating vendor dependence risk
at Expert governance level.
