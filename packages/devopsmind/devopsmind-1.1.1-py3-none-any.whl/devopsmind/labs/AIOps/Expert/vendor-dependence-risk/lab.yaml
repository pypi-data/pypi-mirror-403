  - Assume the AI system cannot be easily replaced.

  why: >
    Vendor dependence is not a procurement issue alone.
    When AI systems become embedded in operations, loss of
    autonomy can prevent effective response during incidents.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider how vendor constraints affect incident response.

      Think about:
      - What happens when the vendor system is unavailable
      - Who controls failure remediation timelines
      - Whether exit options are realistic
    after: >
      Reflect on whether convenience today creates
      operational paralysis tomorrow.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames executive-level reasoning when assessing
    vendor dependence risk created by an AI system. The emphasis
    is on operational autonomy and accountability during failure,
    not commercial convenience.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat vendor lock-in as an operational risk
    - Assume vendors fail independently of your systems
    - Reassert internal ownership of incident response
    - Evaluate whether exit is feasible under pressure

  real_world_context:
    - Do not propose renegotiation or contract changes
    - Do not suggest backup vendors or redundancy
    - Decide using current dependency reality
    - Assess failure scenarios realistically
    - Favor rejection when autonomy is compromised
