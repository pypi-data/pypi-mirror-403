# Auditability and Defensibility Doctrine

Operational decisions must be auditable and defensible.

Accuracy does not replace explainability.
Intent does not replace evidence.

---

## Audit Requirement

All production decisions must be reconstructable
after incidents.

Decisions that cannot be explained
are treated as governance failures.

---

## Accountability

When decision reasoning cannot be reconstructed,
accountability defaults to system approvers
and current operators.

Opacity does not transfer responsibility.
It concentrates it.

---

## Governance Risk

Non-auditable decisions create persistent organizational risk.

Risk exists regardless of incident frequency
or technical success.

Systems that introduce non-defensible decisions
are restricted or removed.

---

## Non-Negotiable

If decisions influenced by an AIOps system
cannot be defended under audit,
the system must not influence decisions.

This doctrine is binding for Expert-level
auditability and defensibility evaluation.
