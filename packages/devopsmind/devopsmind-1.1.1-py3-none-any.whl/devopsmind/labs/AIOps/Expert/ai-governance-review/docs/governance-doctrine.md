# Enterprise AIOps Governance Doctrine

Approval of an AIOps system constitutes acceptance of enterprise risk.

Approval is a governance act.
It is not a technical milestone, experiment, or trial.

---

## Authority

Enterprise AIOps systems operate only by explicit governance approval.

Technical capability does not confer approval eligibility.
Operational benefit does not override governance constraints.

Systems that exceed governance tolerance are not approved.

---

## Accountability

Every approved AIOps system has a single accountable human owner.

Accountability is retained under:
- system failure
- incorrect influence
- operational harm
- audit and investigation

Systems without enforceable human accountability are not approved.

---

## Risk Posture

Approved AIOps systems are assumed to fail.

Governance decisions are evaluated against worst-case impact,
not expected performance.

Systems that cannot be defended after failure are not approved.

---

## Auditability

All approved AIOps systems must be auditable.

System influence must be reconstructable.
Decision paths must be traceable.

Systems that cannot support post-incident audit are not approved.

---

## Precedent

Every approval establishes organizational precedent.

Precedent applies beyond the original system,
team, and context.

Approvals that weaken governance standards are not granted.

---

## Rejection

Rejection of AIOps capability is a valid governance outcome.

Approval is not required to demonstrate innovation,
progress, or technical maturity.

---

## Non-Negotiable

If an AIOps system cannot satisfy governance constraints
without exception, interpretation, or mitigation,
it is not approved.

This doctrine is binding for enterprise AIOps governance.
