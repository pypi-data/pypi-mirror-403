# Risk Acceptance Doctrine

Risk acceptance is an explicit governance act.

Accepted risk persists until exposure ends.

---

## Authority

Only governance bodies may accept organizational risk.

Acceptance is not implied by use,
delay, or continued operation.

---

## Permanence

Accepted risk does not decay over time.

Each incident materializing from accepted risk
reaffirms the original decision.

---

## Accountability

Responsibility for accepted risk
rests with those who authorize acceptance.

Responsibility persists after failure.

---

## Governance Discipline

Accepting risk does not require mitigation.
It requires ownership.

Risks that cannot be owned
are not accepted.

---

## Non-Negotiable

If accepting risk cannot be defended
after material harm,
the risk is not accepted.

This doctrine is binding for Expert-level
organizational risk acceptance decisions.
