stack: aiops
difficulty: Expert
xp: 300

goal: "Decide whether an AIOps system should be permitted to influence decisions across multiple operational domains"

skills:
  - cross-domain-risk-evaluation
  - organizational-boundary-setting
  - governance-decision-making
  - accountability-ownership

hint:
  - Assume the system is effective in one domain.
  - Cross-domain influence multiplies risk.

  why: >
    AI systems often begin in a narrow scope and gradually
    expand across teams. Expert engineers must decide
    whether cross-domain influence is safe or creates
    unacceptable systemic risk.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider how decisions propagate across organizational boundaries.

      Think about:
      - How risk multiplies with scope
      - Who owns failures that span teams
      - Whether local success justifies global influence
    after: >
      Reflect on whether limiting scope is a safety feature,
      not a limitation.

solution:
  overview: >
    This solution frames executive-level reasoning when deciding
    whether an AI system should influence decisions across
    multiple operational domains. The emphasis is on systemic
    risk and clarity of ownership.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat scope expansion as a risk multiplier
    - Assume accountability blurs across domains
    - Reassert clear ownership boundaries
    - Evaluate whether cross-domain use is defensible

  real_world_context:
    - Do not propose phased expansion or pilots
    - Do not introduce coordination processes
    - Decide using current scope and evidence
    - Assess organizational exposure realistically
    - Favor restriction when ownership is unclear
