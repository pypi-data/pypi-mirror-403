# Incident Triage and Control Boundaries

Incident triage is the process of determining
what is failing, how severe the failure is,
and who must respond.

## Why Teams Add Automation
- Faster initial response
- Reduced manual correlation
- Support during high alert volume

## Where Triage Becomes Dangerous
- Incorrect severity suppresses escalation
- Ownership is assigned implicitly
- Early decisions shape the entire response

## Boundary Failures
- AI acting beyond its intended scope
- “Suggested” decisions becoming defaults
- Humans assuming AI decisions were validated
