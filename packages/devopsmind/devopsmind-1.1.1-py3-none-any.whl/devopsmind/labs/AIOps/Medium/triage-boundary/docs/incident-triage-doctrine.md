# Incident Triage Authority Doctrine

Incident triage determines urgency and ownership.

Early triage decisions:
- Shape escalation paths
- Assign responsibility
- Influence the speed and seriousness of response

Because triage decisions guide all downstream actions,
they represent authority, not analysis.

AI systems may assist by correlating signals
or summarizing available information.
They must never assign ownership, severity,
or escalation paths.

Defaults are decisions.
Silence is delegation.

If triage authority cannot be clearly retained by humans,
AI involvement in triage must not be permitted.

This doctrine defines non-negotiable limits
for AI participation in incident triage.
