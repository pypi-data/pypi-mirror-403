# Incident Communication Authority Doctrine

Incident communication shapes perception before facts are complete.

Messages sent during incidents:
- Influence customer trust
- Affect legal and reputational exposure
- Persist beyond the incident itself

Because communication creates external commitments,
authorship is an act of responsibility, not convenience.

AI systems may assist with drafting or formatting.
They must never author, approve, or release messages
that carry organizational commitment.

Reassurance without certainty is misrepresentation.
Speed without accountability erodes trust.

If boundaries between assistance and authorship
cannot be stated explicitly,
AI involvement in incident communication must not be permitted.

This doctrine defines non-negotiable limits
for AI participation in incident communication.
