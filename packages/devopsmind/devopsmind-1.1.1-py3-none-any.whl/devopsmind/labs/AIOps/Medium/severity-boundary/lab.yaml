  intent: boundary

  guidance:
    before: |
      Incident severity determines how urgently
      the organization responds to an issue.

      Changing severity alters escalation paths,
      leadership attention, and communication urgency.
      Allowing AI to adjust severity without limits
      risks suppressing critical response.

    after: |
      It is safer to escalate incorrectly
      than to downplay silently.
