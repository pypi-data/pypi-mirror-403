# AI Must Stop in Incident Severity Changes

Objective:

Define explicit boundaries for AI involvement in changing incident severity.

---
Requirements:

- You are responsible for an incident management process that uses severity levels.
- A proposal suggests allowing AI to adjust incident severity during response.
- **You must edit and replace the contents of `severity-boundary.md` under the provided headings.**

---
Task Requirements:

- Define where AI may assist with severity assessment.
- Define where AI must stop and human judgment is mandatory.
- Record these boundaries clearly and unambiguously.

---
Constraints:

- You may not assume severity changes are harmless.
- You may not rely on later correction as a safeguard.
- You may not design incident management tooling.
- This is a boundary definition task, not a severity optimization exercise.
