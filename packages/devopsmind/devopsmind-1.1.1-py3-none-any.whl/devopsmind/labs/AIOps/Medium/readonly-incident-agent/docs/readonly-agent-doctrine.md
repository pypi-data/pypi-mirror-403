# Read-Only AIOps Agent Doctrine

Read-only agents exist to assist understanding, not to act.

During incidents:
- Analysis informs judgment
- Action carries risk
- Authority determines accountability

Any agent that can act, decide, or resolve
implicitly accepts risk on behalf of humans.

Read-only means:
- No state change
- No execution
- No authority
- No implicit decisions

Human operators remain solely responsible
for interpreting analysis and taking action.

If a boundary between observation and action
cannot be stated explicitly,
the agent must not be permitted.

This doctrine defines non-negotiable limits
for read-only AIOps agents.
