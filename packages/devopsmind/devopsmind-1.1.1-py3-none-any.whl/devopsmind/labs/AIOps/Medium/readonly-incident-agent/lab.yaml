  why: >
    This lab teaches how AIOps agents are safely designed in industry.
    Real-world agents analyze incidents but do not execute changes.
  intent: core
  guidance:
    before: |
      Think about how incident data is collected and reviewed today without AI.
      Consider what information is safe for an agent to observe.

      Optional manual inspection (not required for validation):
      - Review example logs or incident summaries using read-only tools
      - Inspect metrics or alert data for signal vs noise
      - cat / less / grep for understanding only
    after: >
      Reflect on what safeguards prevent AI from making unsafe operational decisions.
