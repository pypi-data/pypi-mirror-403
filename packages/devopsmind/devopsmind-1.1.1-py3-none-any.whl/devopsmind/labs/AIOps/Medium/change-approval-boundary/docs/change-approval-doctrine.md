# Change Approval Authority Doctrine

Change approval is an act of risk acceptance.

When a change is approved:
- The organization accepts potential failure
- Accountability is established
- Authority is exercised, not advised

Because risk acceptance carries consequences,
authority cannot be delegated implicitly or indirectly.

AI systems may assist with analysis.
They must never participate in accepting risk.

Any influence that shapes approval is authority.
Any authority without accountability is governance failure.

If a boundary between assistance and approval cannot be stated explicitly,
AI involvement in change approval must not be permitted.

This doctrine defines non-negotiable limits
for AI participation in production change approval.
