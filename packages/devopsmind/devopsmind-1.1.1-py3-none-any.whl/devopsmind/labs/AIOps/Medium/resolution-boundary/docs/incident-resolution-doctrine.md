# Incident Resolution Action Doctrine

Incident resolution actions change system state.

When actions are taken:
- Systems are modified
- Risk is committed
- Reversibility is not guaranteed

Because actions have irreversible consequences,
the authority to act is a human responsibility,
not an analytical function.

AI systems may assist by presenting information,
options, or potential impacts.
They must never execute, trigger, or decide actions.

Advice can be reviewed.
Actions commit the system to a new state.

If boundaries between advice and action
cannot be stated explicitly,
AI involvement in incident resolution must not be permitted.

This doctrine defines non-negotiable limits
for AI participation in incident resolution.
