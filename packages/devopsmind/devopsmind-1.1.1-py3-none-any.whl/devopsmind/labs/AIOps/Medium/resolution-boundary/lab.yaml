  why: "This lab trains engineers to define where AI must not cross from recommendation into action during incidents."
  intent: boundary

  guidance:
    before: |
      Incident resolution actions directly modify live systems.
      Restarts, rollbacks, traffic shifts, and feature disables
      can mitigate incidents — or amplify them.

      Allowing AI to influence actions without clear limits
      risks irreversible harm.
      Your task is to define where AI involvement must stop.

    after: |
      Advice can be reviewed.
      Actions commit the system to a new state.
