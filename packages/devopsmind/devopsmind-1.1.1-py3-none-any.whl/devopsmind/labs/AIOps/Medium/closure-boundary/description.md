# AI Must Stop in Incident Closure Decisions

Objective:

Define explicit boundaries for AI involvement in incident closure decisions.

---
Requirements:

Define explicit boundaries that separate:
- Where AI may assist in assessing incident state
- Where AI must not participate and human judgment is mandatory

Your boundaries must be clear, final, and enforceable at the decision level.

- **You must edit and replace the contents of `closure-boundary.md` under the provided headings.**

---
Task Requirements:

- Define where AI may assist with assessing incident resolution.
- Define where AI must stop and human judgment is mandatory.
- Record these boundaries clearly and unambiguously.

---
Constraints:

- You may not assume resolution signals are complete or correct.
- You may not rely on reopening incidents as a safeguard.
- You may not design incident workflows or tooling.
- This is a boundary definition task, not a process automation exercise.
