  why: "This lab trains engineers to define where AI must not influence the declaration that an incident is over."
  intent: boundary

  guidance:
    before: |
      Incident closure is not just a status change.
      It signals that impact has ended,
      that investigation may stop,
      and that accountability moves to post-incident review.

      Allowing AI to influence closure decisions without limits
      risks unresolved issues being silently accepted as resolved.
      Your task is to define where AI involvement must stop.

    after: |
      Ending attention too early is often worse
      than extending investigation longer than necessary.
