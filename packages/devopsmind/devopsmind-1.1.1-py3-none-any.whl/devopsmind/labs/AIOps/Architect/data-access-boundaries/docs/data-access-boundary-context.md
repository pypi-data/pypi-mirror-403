# Data Access Boundaries Context

Organizational data represents long-term exposure.

At platform scale:
- Data access decisions persist beyond individual systems
- Exposure cannot be undone once access occurs
- Legal, ethical, and trust consequences may surface years later

In this scenario:
- AI systems are increasingly granted access to organizational data
- Access spans multiple data domains and sensitivity levels
- No platform-wide boundaries define which data must remain inaccessible

As AI usage expands:
- Historical data may be reinterpreted
- Trust assumptions may shift retroactively
- Future incidents will trace back to present access decisions

The platform remains operational.
No unified AI data-access boundary exists.
