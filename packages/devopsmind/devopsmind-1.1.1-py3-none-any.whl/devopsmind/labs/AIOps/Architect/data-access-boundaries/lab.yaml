title: "Define Platform-Wide AI Boundaries for Data Access"
stack: aiops
difficulty: Architect
xp: 750

goal: >
  Define clear boundaries for where AI is allowed
  and disallowed in accessing organizational data.

skills:
  - data_governance_judgment
  - irreversible_exposure_assessment
  - ai_boundary_definition
  - organizational_risk_ownership

hint:
  - Data exposure cannot be undone.
  - Access defines long-term organizational risk.

  why: >
    At Architect level, engineers must decide
    which data the organization will never risk exposing.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - Which data exposures are irreversible
      - Legal, ethical, and trust consequences
      - Whether access can ever be justified after breach
    after: >
      Data boundaries define the organization’s future risk.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can define
    data-access boundaries that prevent irreversible
    organizational exposure.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat data access as irreversible commitment
    - Define disallowed domains as permanent
    - Focus on exposure, not convenience
    - Avoid procedural enforcement framing

  real_world_context:
    - No enforcement mechanisms are assumed
    - No future safeguards are referenced
    - Decisions must stand after data-related incidents
