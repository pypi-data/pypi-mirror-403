# Incident Response Boundaries Context

Incident response is the point where organizational accountability is tested under pressure.

During incidents:
- Decisions are time-sensitive
- Consequences are immediate
- Accountability is later reconstructed through review and audit

As AI systems become involved in incident response:
- Decision attribution may blur
- Human hesitation may increase
- Speed may displace deliberate judgment

In this scenario:
- AI influence during incidents is increasing
- No platform-wide boundaries define where AI must stop
- Human responders remain present but authority lines are unclear

After major incidents:
- Decisions are scrutinized retrospectively
- Responsibility must be traceable
- Automated influence becomes a point of contention
