# Architectural Governance Doctrine — Platform-Wide AI Boundaries

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not prescribe enforcement mechanisms or operational design.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Platform boundaries are governance commitments.

They define:
- What risks the organization will never accept
- Where AI is not allowed to exist
- How future systems are constrained before they are designed

This doctrine exists to ensure that
AI adoption remains governable at scale.

---

## Platform Boundaries vs Controls

Controls manage risk.
Boundaries prevent it.

When boundaries are absent:
- Risk accumulates silently
- Controls multiply without coherence
- Governance degrades into reaction

Platform boundaries are irreversible decisions.
They must hold even when AI capability improves.

---

## Scope of Platform Boundaries

Platform boundaries operate above systems.

They apply to:
- All current AI systems
- All future AI systems
- All organizational domains unless explicitly excluded

Boundaries are not tuned.
They are declared.

---

## Disallowed Platform Domains

Certain domains must be permanently excluded from AI operation.

These include domains where:
- Accountability cannot be meaningfully assigned
- Harm is irreversible
- Legal, ethical, or trust failure cannot be repaired
- Decisions commit the organization beyond recovery

Disallowed means permanent.
Exceptions undermine governance.

---

## Permitted Platform Domains

AI may exist where:
- Human ownership is explicit
- Accountability remains attributable
- Failure impact is bounded by design

Permission does not imply endorsement.
It implies tolerable risk with ownership.

---

## Governance Expectation

Architect-level platform boundaries must:
- Survive organizational growth
- Remain valid under executive review
- Withstand regulatory and legal scrutiny
- Constrain future design decisions

Ambiguous boundaries
become future failure vectors.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines evaluation standards only.

It does not allow:
- Enforcement mechanisms
- Operational workflows
- Mitigation strategies
- Conditional allowances

Reasoning must be platform-scale,
defensible, and durable.
