# Architectural Governance Doctrine — Human Ownership Boundaries

This document defines how reasoning is evaluated in this lab.
It does not prescribe organizational roles or enforcement mechanisms.

---

## Purpose of This Doctrine

Ownership is not a process.
It is a responsibility.

This doctrine exists to ensure that
AI systems never become implicit owners
of decisions, outcomes, or consequences.

At platform scale, ownership must survive:
- Failure
- Audit
- Legal scrutiny
- Ethical review

---

## Ownership as a Non-Transferable Property

Responsibility cannot be delegated to systems.

AI may influence outcomes,
but it cannot own them.

When ownership becomes ambiguous:
- Accountability weakens
- Failures lack attribution
- Organizational risk becomes unbounded

Ownership must always resolve to a human authority.

---

## AI Influence Boundary

AI may support human judgment,
but must never replace ownership.

Delegating ownership to AI:
- Breaks accountability chains
- Obscures responsibility after harm
- Undermines governance legitimacy

The boundary is not about competence.
It is about responsibility.

---

## Disallowed Ownership Domains

Certain domains require permanent human ownership.

These include:
- Decisions with legal consequence
- Actions with ethical responsibility
- Outcomes that commit the organization
- Situations where blame or liability may arise

In these domains, AI must never act autonomously.

---

## Permitted Ownership Support Domains

AI may assist where:
- A human explicitly owns the outcome
- Responsibility remains attributable
- Decisions are defensible after failure

Assistance does not equal ownership.
Influence does not equal accountability.

---

## Decision Expectation

Architect-level ownership boundaries must be explicit,
durable, and platform-wide.

Ambiguity in ownership
creates institutional risk.

This doctrine does not mandate specific domains.
It requires that boundaries survive
executive, legal, and regulatory scrutiny.

---

## Evaluation Boundary

This doctrine defines how analysis is assessed.

It does not allow role assignment,
RACI models, or procedural enforcement.

Reasoning must remain architectural and defensible.
