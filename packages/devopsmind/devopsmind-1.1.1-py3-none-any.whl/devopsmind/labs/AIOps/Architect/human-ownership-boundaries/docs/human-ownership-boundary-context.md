# Human Ownership Boundaries Context

Organizational accountability depends on clear human ownership.

As AI systems become embedded in operational decision-making:
- Responsibility may appear distributed
- Decisions may lack a single accountable owner
- Failures may trigger disputes over responsibility

In this scenario:
- AI influence spans multiple organizational domains
- Human ownership is inconsistently defined
- Some outcomes are attributed to “the system” rather than a person

As automation expands:
- Accountability may dissolve into abstraction
- Legal and ethical responsibility may become contested
- Future audits will demand clear ownership attribution

The platform remains operational.
No unified boundary exists defining where human ownership is mandatory.
