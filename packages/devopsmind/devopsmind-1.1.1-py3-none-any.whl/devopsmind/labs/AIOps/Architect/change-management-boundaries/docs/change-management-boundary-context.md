# Change Management Boundaries Context

Change management determines how risk is introduced
into production environments.

At platform scale, changes:
- Can be irreversible
- Often propagate beyond their initial scope
- Assign responsibility after the fact

In this scenario:
- AI systems are increasingly consulted during change activities
- Influence spans initiation, assessment, and execution stages
- No platform-wide boundaries define where AI influence must stop

As change velocity increases:
- Attribution of responsibility becomes unclear
- Failures may trace back to automated influence
- Governance decisions made today will be tested later

The platform remains operational.
No unified AI boundary for change management exists.
