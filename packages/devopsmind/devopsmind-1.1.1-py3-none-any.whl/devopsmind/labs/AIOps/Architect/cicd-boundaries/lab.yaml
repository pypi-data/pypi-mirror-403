title: "Define Platform-Wide AI Boundaries Within CI/CD Pipelines"
stack: aiops
difficulty: Architect
xp: 750

goal: >
  Define clear boundaries for where AI is allowed
  and disallowed within CI/CD pipelines.

skills:
  - cicd_governance_design
  - blast_radius_containment
  - ai_boundary_definition
  - organizational_risk_ownership

hint:
  - CI/CD failures propagate instantly.
  - Pipeline decisions scale across the organization.

  why: >
    At Architect level, engineers must decide
    whether AI is allowed to influence the
    production path at all.
  intent: judge
  guidance:
    before: |
      Consider:
      - Which pipeline stages tolerate no ambiguity
      - Where rollback is not a meaningful control
      - How CI/CD accelerates failure
    after: >
      Boundaries in CI/CD define the organization’s
      tolerance for automated change.

solution:
  overview: >
    This lab evaluates whether the learner can define
    CI/CD-specific AI boundaries that prevent
    organization-wide failure propagation.

  professional_reasoning:
    - Treat CI/CD as a high-risk amplification layer
    - Define disallowed zones as permanent
    - Focus on irreversible change paths
    - Avoid procedural enforcement framing

  real_world_context:
    - No enforcement mechanisms are assumed
    - No future safeguards are referenced
    - Decisions must stand after pipeline failure

  runtime: docker
  requires_execution: false
