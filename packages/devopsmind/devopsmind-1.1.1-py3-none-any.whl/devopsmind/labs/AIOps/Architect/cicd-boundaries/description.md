# Define Platform-Wide AI Boundaries Within CI/CD Pipelines

Objective:

- Define where AI is allowed and disallowed across CI/CD pipelines.
- Treat CI/CD as a blast-radius multiplier, not a tooling concern.
- Issue boundaries that constrain future pipeline design.

---
Requirements:

- You must edit and replace the contents of `cicd_boundary_review.md`
  under the provided headings.
- All placeholder guidance must be removed before validation.

---
Task Requirements:

- Assess CI/CD stages where AI introduces unacceptable organizational risk.
- Identify pipeline stages where AI must never operate.
- Define stages where AI may be permitted with explicit human ownership.
- Justify boundaries under executive and regulatory scrutiny.

---
Constraints:

- No tooling, implementation, or enforcement mechanisms.
- No mitigation, safeguards, or approval workflows.
- No system-level evaluation.
- No conditional or temporary boundaries.
- Offline, judgment-based decision only.
