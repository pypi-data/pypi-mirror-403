# Approval Authority Boundaries Context

In large platforms, approval and authorization decisions
assign responsibility, liability, and accountability.

As AI systems become integrated into operational workflows:
- Recommendations increasingly influence approvals
- Decision latency decreases
- Human reviewers rely on AI summaries or signals

In this scenario:
- AI systems are consulted during approval and authorization decisions
- No platform-wide boundaries define where AI influence must stop
- Approval authority varies across teams and domains

Over time:
- Authority attribution becomes unclear
- Responsibility may be disputed after failure
- Legal and regulatory scrutiny will test approval traceability

The platform remains operational.
No unified authority boundary has been established.
