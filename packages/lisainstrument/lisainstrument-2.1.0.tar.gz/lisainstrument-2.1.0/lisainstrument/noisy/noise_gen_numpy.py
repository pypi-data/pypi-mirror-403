"""The lisainstrument.noisy.noise_gen_numpy module provides numpy-based noise generation

Given a noise definition of type NoiseDefBase, create a NoiseGen instance, which
provides a corresponding noise generation function. This noise generator has internal
state and can be called repeatedly to obtain chunks of noise samples.

Internally, the code is organized around stateless generators that require the state
as explicit parameters. This is suitable for use in the streams package. There is a class
for each elementary noise definition type, implementing the noise generation. Those classes
implement a protocol NoiseGenStateless. By elementary noises we refer to noises that can
be part of noise definitions returned by calls to the elementary() method of any noise.
