"""Utilities for defining FIR filters and filtering 1D numpy arrays

This module provides basic definitions for FIR filters and functionality
to apply them to simple 1D numpy arrays. This is used in the streams.firfilter
module to apply FIR filter to streams in chunked data processing.

To define a FIR filter, use the class DefFilterFIR. The filters are specified
by their coefficients and the center location. Instances of DefFilterFIR provide
the required margin sizes (domain of dependence). To set up such a filter where
the center location corresponds to what is called a causal filter, use
make_fir_causal_normal_from_coeffs(). Further, there is a convinience function
make_fir_causal_kaiser() to  set up a FIR definition for a Kaiser window.

The filter definitions can be used to create corresponding functions operating
on numpy arrays. For this, use the `make_filter_fir_numpy` function.

When applying FIR filters, one needs to specify boundary conditions. The
available options are specified using the EdgeHandling enum class.

Example use:

>>> input_data = np.linspace(0, 100, 103)
>>> fir_coeffs = [0.1, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1]
>>> fir_def = DefFilterFIR(filter_coeffs=fir_coeffs, offset=-1)
>>> fir_filt = make_filter_fir_numpy(fir_def, EdgeHandling.ZEROPAD, EdgeHandling.VALID)
>>> filtered_data = fir_filt(input_data)


Internally, the module is organized as follows.
The application of a FIR filter without handling boundary conditions is
implemented in a class FIRCoreOp. It requires that the input arrays
are already suitably padded with margins. This requirement is not exclusive
to FIR filters. It is encoded in the SemiLocalMapType protocol which is
implemented by FIRCoreOp. This generalization is useful when implementing
filters in chunked processing.

Applying a transform of the SemiLocalMapType to a numpy array is the purpose of
the semilocal_map_numpy() function. This also takes care of the boundary
conditions by padding its input accordingly. The special case of applying
a FIR filter is handled by the convenience function filter_fir_numpy().
Finally, the make_filter_fir_numpy() function turns the above into an
unary operator, binding all arguments except the array to be filtered.
