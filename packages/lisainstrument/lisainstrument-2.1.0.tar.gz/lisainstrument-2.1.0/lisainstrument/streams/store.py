"""Implements a stream that transfers its input to a DataStorage instance


This is used internally by the task scheduler and should not be used directly.
StreamStore is a special stream type in that it has side effects, the output is
not used, and it is not part of the StreamBundle but injected by the task scheduler.
The side effect is to store the incoming results using the DataStorage framework.
