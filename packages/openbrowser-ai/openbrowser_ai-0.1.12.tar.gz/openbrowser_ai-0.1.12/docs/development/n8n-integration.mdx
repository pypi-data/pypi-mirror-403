# OpenBrowser n8n Integration

OpenBrowser can be integrated with [n8n](https://n8n.io), a workflow automation platform, using our community node. This integration allows you to trigger browser automation tasks directly from your n8n workflows.

## Installing the n8n Community Node

There are several ways to install the OpenBrowser community node in n8n:

### Using n8n Desktop or Cloud

1. Navigate to **Settings > Community Nodes**
2. Click on **Install**
3. Enter `n8n-nodes-openbrowser` in the **Name** field
4. Click **Install**

### Using a Self-hosted n8n Instance

Run the following command in your n8n installation directory:

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-openbrowser
```

### For Development

<Note>
The n8n community node repository is currently in development. The instructions below will be updated once the repository is available.

## Setting Up API Credentials

To use the OpenBrowser node in n8n, you need to configure API credentials for your LLM provider:

1. Get an API key from your preferred LLM provider (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.)
2. In n8n, create a new credential:
   - Go to **Credentials** tab
   - Click **Create New**
   - Select the appropriate credential type for your LLM
   - Enter your API key
   - Save the credential

## Using the OpenBrowser Node

Once installed, you can add the OpenBrowser node to your workflows:

1. In your workflow editor, search for "OpenBrowser" in the nodes panel
2. Add the node to your workflow
3. Set-up the credentials
4. Choose your saved credentials
5. Select an operation:
   - **Run Task**: Execute a browser automation task with natural language instructions
   - **Get Task**: Retrieve task details
   - **Get Task Status**: Check task execution status
   - **Pause/Resume/Stop Task**: Control running tasks
   - **Get Task Media**: Retrieve screenshots, videos, or PDFs
   - **List Tasks**: Get a list of tasks

### Example: Running a Browser Task

Here's a simple example of how to use the OpenBrowser node to run a browser task:

1. Add the OpenBrowser node to your workflow
2. Select the "Run Task" operation
3. In the "Instructions" field, enter a natural language description of what you want the browser to do, for example:
   ```
   Go to example.com, take a screenshot of the homepage, and extract all the main heading texts
   ```
4. Optionally enable "Save Browser Data" to preserve cookies and session information
5. Connect the node to subsequent nodes to process the results

## Workflow Examples

The OpenBrowser n8n node enables various automation scenarios:

- **Web Scraping**: Extract data from websites on a schedule
- **Form Filling**: Automate data entry across web applications
- **Monitoring**: Check website status and capture visual evidence
- **Report Generation**: Generate PDFs or screenshots of web dashboards
- **Multi-step Processes**: Chain browser tasks together using session persistence

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the OpenBrowser node:

- Verify your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Check that your instructions are clear and specific
- For complex tasks, consider breaking them into multiple steps
- Refer to the [OpenBrowser documentation](https://docs.openbrowser.me) for instruction best practices
