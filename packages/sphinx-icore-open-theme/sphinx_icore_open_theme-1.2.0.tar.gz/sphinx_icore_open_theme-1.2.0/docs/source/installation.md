## Static path for images & custom stylesheet

If you're using any of the image-related options listed on :doc:`customization`
(`logo`) or a :ref:`custom stylesheet <custom-stylesheet>`, you'll also want to
tell Sphinx where to get these files from. If so, add a line like this (changing
the path if necessary; see `the Sphinx docs for 'html_static_path'`
[html_static_path](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-html_static_path)
to your `conf.py`:

```python
html_static_path = ['_static']
```
