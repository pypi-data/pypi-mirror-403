"""MAGICC climate model components.

This module is a scaffold for future MAGICC (Model for the Assessment of
Greenhouse gas Induced Climate Change) component implementations.

MAGICC is a reduced-complexity climate model widely used for climate policy
analysis. The components in this module will provide Rust implementations
of MAGICC's key physical processes.

Planned Components
------------------
The following components are planned for future implementation:

- Gas cycle components (CO2, CH4, N2O, halocarbons)
- Radiative forcing components
- Temperature response components
- Ocean carbon cycle
- Permafrost feedback

Note
----
This module is currently empty. Components will be added as the MAGICC
reimplementation progresses. See the `rscm._lib.components` module for
currently available generic components.
