"""EventBus pub/sub pattern for observability and tracing.

Pattern Overview:
    Publisher: Emits events (fire-and-forget, no return value)
    Subscriber: Registers handlers with topic-based filtering
    Decoupling: Publishers don't know subscribers, subscribers don't block publishers

    This pattern enables distributed observability without coupling business logic
    to instrumentation concerns.

Handler Dispatch:
    Concurrent: All handlers run concurrently via asyncio.gather()
    Async-only: Handlers must be async coroutines
    Exception isolation: Handler failures don't propagate or affect other handlers
    No ordering guarantee: Handlers execute in arbitrary order

    Dispatch is fire-and-forget - emit() returns after all handlers complete/fail,
    but individual handler results are not captured.

Filtering:
    Topic-based: Subscribe to specific event types (e.g., "node.start", "node.error")
    No wildcards: Each topic is exact-match only
    Multiple topics: Handlers can subscribe to multiple topics independently

    Advanced filtering (predicates, payload matching) not currently supported.

Use Cases:
    - Distributed tracing: Emit span start/end events, handlers collect traces
    - Metrics collection: Count events, measure durations, track throughput
    - Audit logging: Record state changes, user actions, system events
    - Error reporting: Centralize exception handling, send to monitoring systems
    - Observable execution: Instrument async workflows without tight coupling

    Pattern Validation:

        Tests clear() effect on emit(): cleared topics become no-ops.
        Verifies lifecycle interaction between management and dispatch.

        Pattern:
            Immediate cutoff: clear() takes effect instantly
            Past events preserved: Handlers already executed not affected
            Future events dropped: No handlers = no execution

        Mechanics:
            clear() removes topic from internal registry -> emit() finds no handlers
            -> no-op dispatch (safe, doesn't raise).

        Real-world: Feature flag disables tracing by calling clear("trace.*") topics,
                   instantly stopping trace collection without code changes.

    Integration Tests:
        Real-world patterns: Metrics, tracing, audit logging combined
        Multi-topic coordination: Different event types with shared handlers
        Complex argument passing: Rich event payloads

    Patterns Demonstrated:
        - Observable execution: start/finish event pairs
        - Metrics collection: Counters aggregating across events
        - Cross-cutting concerns: Log handler subscribes to all topics
        - Structured payloads: Complex nested data in events

    These tests validate that EventBus supports production observability needs,
    not just simple pub/sub mechanics.
