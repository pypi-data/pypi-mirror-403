Broadcaster Test Suite

Tests for singleton pub/sub broadcaster with O(1) memory overhead.

## Design Pattern

Singleton + Class-level State:
    - Single global broadcaster instance per class
    - All subclasses share same subscribers (class-level)
    - O(1) memory overhead regardless of usage

## Mathematical Model

Broadcaster B = (
    _instance: B | None,              // Singleton instance
    _subscribers: List[Callback],     // Class-level subscribers
    _event_type: Type                 // Event type constraint
)

Singleton Invariant:
    All calls: Broadcaster() -> same instance

Subscription:
    subscribe(cb) => _subscribers.append(cb) if cb not in _subscribers
    unsubscribe(cb) => _subscribers.remove(cb) if cb in _subscribers
    broadcast(evt) => for cb in _subscribers: cb(evt) // Fire-and-forget

## Broadcaster vs EventBus

Comparison:
    EventBus: Multi-topic, instance-based, flexible routing
    Broadcaster: Single global channel, singleton, minimal overhead

Trade-offs:
    + Minimal memory overhead (O(1) regardless of usage)
    + Simple API (no topic routing)
    + Class-level isolation (subclasses independent)
    - Less flexible (single channel per subclass)
    - Global state (harder to test, requires cleanup)

## Core Invariants

1. Singleton Instance: Only one Broadcaster instance per subclass
2. Class-level Subscribers: Shared across all instances of subclass
3. Sync/Async Support: Callbacks can be sync or async functions
4. Event Type Safety: _event_type constrains broadcasted events
5. Exception Isolation: Callback exceptions logged, not propagated
6. Fire-and-Forget: Broadcast doesn't return callback results

## Test Organization

- TestBroadcaster: Singleton pattern, subscription lifecycle, broadcasting semantics

## Design Rationale

Why Singleton?
    - Global event channel (application-wide notifications)
    - O(1) memory overhead (single instance per subclass)
    - No instantiation complexity (automatic singleton)

Why Class-level State?
    - Share subscribers across all instances
    - Persistent state (not tied to instance lifecycle)
    - Simplifies event propagation (no instance routing)

Why Fire-and-Forget?
    - Observability pattern (side-effects, not return values)
    - Exception isolation (one callback failure doesn't block others)
    - Performance (no blocking on callback completion)

## Usage Patterns

Pattern 1: Global Event Notifications
    ```python
    class ShutdownBroadcaster(Broadcaster):
        _event_type = ShutdownEvent


    ShutdownBroadcaster.subscribe(cleanup_handler)
    ShutdownBroadcaster.subscribe(log_shutdown)

    await ShutdownBroadcaster.broadcast(ShutdownEvent())
    ```

Pattern 2: Mixed Sync/Async Callbacks
    ```python
    def sync_callback(event):
        logger.info(f"Event: {event}")


    async def async_callback(event):
        await metrics.record(event)


    Broadcaster.subscribe(sync_callback)
    Broadcaster.subscribe(async_callback)
    await Broadcaster.broadcast(event)
    ```

Pattern 3: Subclass Independence
    ```python
    class TypeABroadcaster(Broadcaster):
        _event_type = TypeAEvent
        _subscribers = []
        _instance = None


    class TypeBBroadcaster(Broadcaster):
        _event_type = TypeBEvent
        _subscribers = []
        _instance = None


    # Independent subscriber lists, independent instances
    ```

## Performance Characteristics

| Operation       | Complexity | Notes                              |
|----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| subscribe()    | O(n)      | List membership check + append     |
| unsubscribe()  | O(n)      | List membership check + remove     |
| broadcast()    | O(n)      | Invoke all callbacks sequentially  |
| singleton()    | O(1)      | Instance check + creation          |

Memory: O(1) overhead per subclass (single instance + subscriber list)

Broadcast Semantics:
    - Async callbacks awaited in registration order
    - Sync callbacks executed immediately
    - Exceptions caught and logged (fire-and-forget)
    - No result aggregation (observability pattern)

## Testing Strategy

- Singleton enforcement (same instance across calls)
- Subscription/unsubscription correctness
- Duplicate subscription prevention
- Async/sync callback dispatch
- Exception isolation (callback failures don't propagate)
- Event type validation (wrong type rejected)
- Multiple subscribers invocation
- Subclass independence (no cross-contamination)
- Empty subscriber list handling
