"""Tests for PriorityQueue with design rationale and architecture decisions.

## Design Decisions

### Async Nowait Methods (Intentional API Divergence from asyncio)

Unlike asyncio.PriorityQueue where put_nowait() and get_nowait() are synchronous,
kron's PriorityQueue uses async nowait methods. This is an intentional
architectural decision driven by anyio.Condition requirements.

**Rationale**:
- anyio.Condition requires async lock acquisition for thread safety
- Synchronous nowait methods would bypass lock acquisition, creating race conditions
- Consistency: All queue operations that touch shared state must acquire locks
- Trade-off: Slightly less convenient API for correctness guarantees

**Critical Bug Fix** (see test_priority_queue_get_nowait_notifies_blocked_put):
- get_nowait() MUST call notify() after removing item
- Without notification, blocked put() tasks deadlock forever
- This was the primary bug fix in PR #14

### Status Methods Are Racy by Design

qsize(), empty(), and full() methods do NOT acquire locks. This matches
asyncio.Queue behavior and is intentional.

**Rationale**:
- Status methods are inherently racy (TOCTOU - Time Of Check Time Of Use)
- Locking doesn't add value: status can change immediately after lock release
- Intended for monitoring/debugging, not critical decision-making logic
- Proper synchronization happens in put()/get() where it matters

**Example of Why Locking Doesn't Help**:
```python
# Even with locks, this is racy
if not q.empty():  # Acquires lock, returns False
    # Lock released here
    # Another task could consume item here
    item = await q.get_nowait()  # QueueEmpty exception!
```

Correct pattern: Use try/except with get_nowait() for non-blocking consumption.

### Notification Semantics

Both put/put_nowait and get/get_nowait call notify() after modifying queue state.
This ensures symmetric wakeup behavior for blocked tasks.

**Critical for Correctness**:
- put() notifies blocked get() tasks when item added
- get() notifies blocked put() tasks when space freed
- put_nowait() notifies blocked get() tasks (symmetry with put)
- get_nowait() notifies blocked put() tasks (symmetry with get)

Without symmetric notification, deadlocks occur in producer-consumer patterns.

## Test Coverage

100% statement coverage (45/45 statements) across:
- Basic operations (put, get, priority ordering)
- Maxsize enforcement
- Blocking behavior (put blocks on full, get blocks on empty)
- Non-blocking operations (put_nowait, get_nowait)
- Exception handling (QueueEmpty, QueueFull)
- Notification correctness (critical deadlock prevention)
- Concurrent access (multiple producers/consumers)
- Status methods (qsize, empty, full)
- Edge cases (FIFO within priority, complex tuple priorities)

Each test runs against both asyncio and trio backends (24 total test executions).
