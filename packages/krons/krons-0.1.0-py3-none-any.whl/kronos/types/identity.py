"""Semantic UUID typing for type-safe entity identification.

Provides ID[T] syntax for associating UUIDs with specific model types,
enabling compile-time type checking and runtime semantic clarity.

Usage:
    from kronos.types import ID

    user_id: ID[User] = uuid4()
    org_id: ID[Organization] = uuid4()

    # Type checker distinguishes these despite both being UUID at runtime

    At runtime: ID[Model] returns Annotated[UUID, ("ID", Model)]
    For type checkers: Provides semantic distinction between UUID types.

    This allows code to express intent clearly:
        user_id: ID[User]      # A UUID that identifies a User
        tenant_id: ID[Tenant]  # A UUID that identifies a Tenant

    Both are UUIDs at runtime, but type checkers can distinguish them.

    ID[T] creates a type annotation that:
