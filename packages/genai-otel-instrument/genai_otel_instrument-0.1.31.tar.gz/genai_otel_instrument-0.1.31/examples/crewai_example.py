"""CrewAI Multi-Agent Framework Instrumentation Example.

This example demonstrates automatic OpenTelemetry instrumentation for
CrewAI, a popular multi-agent collaboration framework with role-based
agents, tasks, and crews.

CrewAI has 30,000+ GitHub stars and 1M+ monthly downloads, making it
one of the most popular agent frameworks.

Requirements:
    pip install genai-otel-instrument
    pip install crewai crewai-tools
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key  # Or other LLM provider
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
"""

import genai_otel

# Initialize instrumentation - CrewAI is enabled automatically
# NOTE: CrewAI's built-in telemetry is automatically disabled by the instrumentor
# to prevent conflicts with OpenTelemetry tracing. The instrumentor sets
# CREWAI_TELEMETRY_OPT_OUT=true environment variable automatically.
