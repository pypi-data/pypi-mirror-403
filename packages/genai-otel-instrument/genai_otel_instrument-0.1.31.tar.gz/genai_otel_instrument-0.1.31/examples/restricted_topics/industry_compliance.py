Example: Industry-Specific Compliance Detection

This example demonstrates how to configure restricted topics for
industry-specific compliance requirements (healthcare, finance, education).

Industry Restrictions:
- Healthcare (HIPAA): Medical advice, diagnoses, treatment recommendations
- Finance (SEC/FINRA): Investment advice, stock tips, financial planning
- Education (FERPA): Student records, grades, personal information
- Legal: Legal advice, case strategy, attorney-client privileged info

Requirements:
    pip install genai-otel-instrument openai

Environment Setup:
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
