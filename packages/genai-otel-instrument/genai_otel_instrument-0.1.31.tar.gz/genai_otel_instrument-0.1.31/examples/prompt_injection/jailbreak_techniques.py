Example: Jailbreak Techniques Detection

This example demonstrates detection of various jailbreak techniques including
DAN (Do Anything Now), evil mode, bypasses, and other manipulation tactics.

Jailbreak Patterns:
- DAN (Do Anything Now) variants
- Evil mode / unrestricted mode
- Developer mode
- Bypass instructions
- Hypothetical scenarios

Requirements:
    pip install genai-otel-instrument openai

Environment Setup:
    export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
