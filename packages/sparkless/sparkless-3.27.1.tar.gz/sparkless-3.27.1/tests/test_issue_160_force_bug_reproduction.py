"""
Test to force reproduction of issue #160 by manipulating the cache directly.

The bug occurs when cached Polars expressions reference dropped columns.
This test tries to force the bug by:
1. Creating an expression that references a column (gets cached)
2. Dropping that column
3. Trying to reuse a similar expression that would use the cached version
