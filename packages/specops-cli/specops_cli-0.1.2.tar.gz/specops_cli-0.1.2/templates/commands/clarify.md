## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

**Goal**: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active infrastructure specification and record clarifications directly in the spec file.

**Note**: This clarification workflow should run BEFORE invoking `/specops.plan`. If user explicitly skips clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), warn that downstream rework risk increases.

### Execution Steps

#### 1. Prerequisites Check

**Run script** from repository root:
```bash
.specops/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only
```

**Parse JSON fields**:
- `FEATURE_DIR` - Feature directory path
- `FEATURE_SPEC` - Specification file path
- `IMPL_PLAN` - Plan file path (optional)
- `TASKS` - Tasks file path (optional)

**If JSON parsing fails**: Abort and instruct user to re-run `/specops.specify` or verify feature branch.

**Note**: For single quotes in args like "I'm deploying", use: `'I'\''m deploying'` or `"I'm deploying"`

#### 3. Generate Prioritized Questions

**Constraints**:
- Maximum 5 questions per session
- Maximum 10 questions total across all sessions
- Each question must be answerable with:
  - Multiple choice (2-5 options), OR
  - Short answer (≤5 words)

**Prioritization Heuristic**: Impact × Uncertainty

**High Impact Categories** (prioritize):
1. Multi-tenancy (affects isolation, security, resource allocation)
2. Cloud provider & region (affects cost, compliance, latency)
3. Compliance requirements (blocks deployment if wrong)
4. Network isolation strategy (affects security posture)
5. Backup & DR (affects data safety)

**Medium Impact Categories**:
6. Specific technology versions
7. Resource sizing
8. Monitoring approach
9. Deployment method

**Low Impact Categories** (defer to plan):
10. Specific module names
11. File organization
12. Stylistic preferences

**Exclusion Rules**:
- Already answered questions
- Plan-level execution details
- Trivial preferences
- Questions that don't impact architecture/security/compliance

---

#### 4. Sequential Question Loop (Interactive)

**Present ONE question at a time**

**For Multiple Choice Questions**:

1. **Analyze options** and determine most suitable based on:
   - Infrastructure best practices
   - Security and compliance
   - Cost optimization
   - Operational simplicity
   - Constitution alignment

2. **Present recommendation prominently**:
   ```
   **Recommended:** Option [X] - <1-2 sentence reasoning>
   ```

3. **Render options table**:
   ```markdown
   | Option | Description |
   |--------|-------------|
   | A | <Infrastructure option A> |
   | B | <Infrastructure option B> |
   | C | <Infrastructure option C> |
   | Short | Provide different answer (≤5 words) |
   ```

4. **Instructions**:
   ```
   Reply with: option letter ("A"), "yes"/"recommended" to accept suggestion, or custom answer (≤5 words)
   ```

**For Short Answer Questions**:

1. **Provide suggested answer**:
   ```
   **Suggested:** <answer> - <brief reasoning>
   ```

2. **Format constraint**:
   ```
   Format: Short answer (≤5 words)
   Reply: "yes"/"suggested" to accept, or provide your answer
   ```

**After User Answers**:
- If "yes"/"recommended"/"suggested" → Use AI's suggestion
- Otherwise validate: maps to option OR ≤5 words
- If ambiguous → Ask disambiguation (doesn't count as new question)
- Record answer in memory, proceed to next

**Stop Conditions**:
- All critical ambiguities resolved
- User signals "done"/"stop"/"no more"
- 5 questions asked
- No more high-impact unclear items

Coverage Summary:

| Category | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Infrastructure Scope | ✓ Resolved | Cloud provider and region defined |
| Multi-Tenancy | ✓ Resolved | Organization list and quotas clear |
| Resources | ✓ Resolved | Compute sizing defined |
| Network & Security | ⏭ Deferred | Details for plan phase |
| Performance | ✓ Resolved | RTO/RPO specified |
| Dependencies | ✓ Resolved | External services identified |
| Monitoring | ⚠ Outstanding | Low impact, can proceed |

Legend:
✓ Resolved - Was unclear, now addressed
⏭ Deferred - Better suited for planning phase
✓ Clear - Already sufficient
⚠ Outstanding - Still unclear but low impact

Recommendation: [READY FOR PLANNING | RUN CLARIFY AGAIN]

Next Steps:
1. Review updated specification
2. Validate multi-tenancy requirements
3. Run /specops.plan to create implementation design

Suggested command: /specops.plan
```

---

## Behavior Rules

### No Critical Ambiguities
If all categories Clear:
```
No critical infrastructure ambiguities detected.

Coverage Summary: All categories sufficient for planning.

Recommendation: Proceed to /specops.plan

Next command: /specops.plan Use Terraform for AWS, Ansible for K8s 1.28
```

### Missing Spec File
If `FEATURE_SPEC` not found:
```
Error: Specification file not found

Please run /specops.specify first to create infrastructure specification.

Command: /specops.specify Deploy monitoring for 3 organizations
```

### Question Quota Rules
- Maximum 5 questions per session
- Maximum 10 questions across all clarification sessions
- Disambiguation retries don't count as new questions
- If 5 reached with high-impact Outstanding → Flag in report

### Early Termination
User signals: "stop", "done", "proceed", "good"
→ Stop questioning, integrate answers so far, report

### Speculative Questions
Avoid unless absence blocks functional clarity:
- ❌ "Which Terraform version?" (if constitution defines it)
- ❌ "Module naming preference?" (stylistic)
- ✅ "Which cloud provider?" (affects everything)
- ✅ "Compliance requirements?" (blocks deployment)

### Context Priority
Use `$ARGUMENTS` for prioritization hints:
- User mentions "security" → Prioritize security questions
- User mentions "multi-cloud" → Prioritize cloud provider questions
- User mentions "compliance" → Prioritize compliance questions
