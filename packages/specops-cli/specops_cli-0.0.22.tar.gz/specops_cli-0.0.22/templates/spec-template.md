# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Infrastructure Scenarios & Validation *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Infrastructure requirements should be PRIORITIZED as deployment scenarios ordered by criticality.
  Each scenario must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable infrastructure component that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each scenario, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each scenario as a standalone slice of infrastructure that can be:
  - Deployed independently
  - Validated independently
  - Rolled back independently
  - Demonstrated independently
-->

### Infrastructure Scenario 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this infrastructure deployment in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently - e.g., "Can be fully validated by [specific test] and delivers [specific capability]"]

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Given** [initial infrastructure state], **When** [deployment action], **Then** [expected infrastructure state]
2. **Given** [initial infrastructure state], **When** [deployment action], **Then** [expected infrastructure state]

---

### Infrastructure Scenario 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this infrastructure deployment in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently]

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Given** [initial infrastructure state], **When** [deployment action], **Then** [expected infrastructure state]

---

### Infrastructure Scenario 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this infrastructure deployment in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Validation**: [Describe how this can be validated independently]

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **Given** [initial infrastructure state], **When** [deployment action], **Then** [expected infrastructure state]

---

[Add more infrastructure scenarios as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [infrastructure failure condition]?
- How does system handle [resource exhaustion scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Infrastructure MUST [specific capability, e.g., "provision VPC with public and private subnets"]
- **FR-002**: Infrastructure MUST [specific capability, e.g., "configure network policies for tenant isolation"]  
- **FR-003**: Platform MUST be able to [key capability, e.g., "auto-scale worker nodes based on demand"]
- **FR-004**: Infrastructure MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist etcd snapshots hourly"]
- **FR-005**: Infrastructure MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all kubectl commands for audit"]

### Deployment Requirements *(if Kubernetes workloads)*

<!-- Deployment strategy (Helm/Kustomize) determined by constitution. List components here. -->

**Required Components**: [e.g., ingress, monitoring, cert-manager - see constitution for available options]

**Custom Applications**:
- [APP_NAME]: [image, port, replicas]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: Infrastructure MUST use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: CNI not specified - Cilium, Calico, or Flannel?]
- **FR-007**: Infrastructure MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: number of organizations not specified]

### Key Infrastructure Components *(include if feature involves resources)*

- **[Component 1]**: [What it represents, key configuration without implementation]
- **[Component 2]**: [What it represents, dependencies to other components]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Infrastructure provisioning completes in under 15 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Cluster handles 1000 pods without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [Operational metric, e.g., "All nodes reach Ready state within 5 minutes of provisioning"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce infrastructure deployment time by 50%"]
