"""Tests for demo persistence fix - P0 validation.

The 100%/0% Paradox:
- Demo-conditioned prompting achieves 100% first-action accuracy
- But 0% episode success rate

Root cause: Demo context was only injected at step 1, dropped at subsequent steps.

Fix: The `demo` parameter in ApiAgent now persists across ALL steps.

These tests validate that:
1. Demo is included in prompts at EVERY step (not just step 1)
2. Demo persists across agent.reset() calls (between tasks)
3. set_demo() works for dynamic demo retrieval scenarios
4. Logs correctly track demo inclusion at each step
