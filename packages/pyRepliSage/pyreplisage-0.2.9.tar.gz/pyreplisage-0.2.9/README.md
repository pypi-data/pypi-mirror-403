# RepliSage
A simulation software for modeling the motion of cohesin during the replication process. This tool explores the interaction between cohesin, or more generally loop extrusion factors (LEFs), with replication forks and chromatin compartmentalization. It employs a sophisticated force-field that integrates MCMC Metropolis and molecular dynamics methodologies. The output is a 3D chromatin trajectory, providing a dynamic visualization of DNA replication and the formation of two identical copies.

## Simulation pipeline
RepliSage is composed by three distinct parts:

- **A replication simulation:** it models solely the propagation of replication forks.
- **A stochastic simulation:** which models the interplay of loop extrusion, replication forks and epiegenetic mark spreading.
- **A molecular dynamics simulation:** which applies a potential and generates 3D structures.

The pipeline looks like the following,

### Replication simulation (Replikator.py)

This is a simplistic *Monte Carlo simulation*, where we import single cell replication timing data to model replication. The average replication timing curves can show us the percentage of cells that have been replicated, and from them we estimate the *initiation rate* $I(x,t)$ which represents the probability fires at time $t$ in loci $x$. Then we employ the Monte Carlo simulation where in each step an origin fires with a probability derived from the initiation rate. When an origin fires, the replication fork start propagating bi-directionally with velocity $v$. The vlocity's mean and standard deviation is derived by calculating the slopes of consecutive optima of the averaged replication timing curve. Replikator outputs the trajectories of the replication forks.

### Stochastic simulation that models the interplay of loop extrusion with other factors

In this part we import the previously produced trajectories of replication forks and we model them as moving barriers for the loop extrusion factors. In this way this simulation is composed by three distinct parts:

#### Loop Extrusion
We use the energy landscape of LoopSage for that. We assume that there are two basic players: LEFs which follow a random difussive motion in 1D and CTCF whose locations are dervied from ChIA-PET data, which are filtered where is a CTCF motif in their sequence. Therefore, assuming that we have $N_{\text{lef}}$ LEFs with two degrees of freedom $(m_i,n_i)$ and epigenetic color states $s_i$ for each monomer, we can write down the following formula,  
    
$$E_{\text{le}} =  c_{\text{fold}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{coh}}}\log(n_i-m_i)+c_{\text{cross}}\sum_{i,j}K(m_i,n_i;m_j,n_j)+c_{\text{bind}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\text{coh}}}\left(L(m_i)+R(n_i)\right).$$
    
In this equation the first term models the folding of chromatin (how fast a loop extrudes, the higher $f$ the more tendency to extrude), the second term is a penalty for cohesin crossing, and the last one minimizes the energy when a LEF encounters a CTCF.
    
#### Compartmentalization

It is modelled by using a five state ($s_i\in[-2,-1,0,1,2]$) Potts model 

$$E_{\text{potts}} = C_{p,1} \sum_{k} \left(\dfrac{h_k + h_{t_{r} k}}{2} \right) s_k +C_{p,2}\sum_{i>j} J_{ij}| s_i - s_j |.$$

The second term includes the interaction matrix $J_{ij}$, which is 1 when there is a LEF connecting $i$ with $j$ and 0 if not. The other term represents an epigeetic field. There is an averaged term $h_k$, which represents the averaged replication timing, and a time dependent term $h_{t_{r} k}$ which represents the spread of the epigenetic state due to a single replication fork.
    
#### Replication
This term models the interaction between the LEFs and replication forks, $$E_{\text{rep}}=C_{\text{rep}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{lef}} \mathcal{R}(m_i,n_i ;f_{\text{rep}})$$ and in general penalizes inapropriate configurations between LEFs and replication forks (read the paper).

Therefore, the stochastic simulation integrates the sum of these energies $E = E_{le}+E_{rep}+E_{potts}$ and uses MCMC Metropolis method.

### Molecular Dynamics

This parts takes as input the states produced by the stochastic simulation and outputs 3D structures by using a potential in OpenMM. The molecular modeling approach assumes two molecular chains, each consisting of $N_{\text{beads}}$ monomers, where $N_{\text{beads}}$ reflects the granularity of the stochastic simulation. The total potential governing the system is expressed as: $$U = U_{\text{bk}} + U_{\text{le}}(t) + U_{\text{rep}}(t) + U_{\text{block}}(t)$$, where each term corresponds to a specific contribution. The backbone potential ($U_{\text{bk}}$) includes strong covalent bonds between consecutive beads, angular forces, and excluded volume effects to maintain chain integrity. The loop-formation potential ($U_{\text{le}}$) is a time-dependent term introducing harmonic bonds to model loop formation. These bonds are weaker than the backbone interactions and act between dynamically changing pairs of beads, $m_i(t)$ and $n_i(t)$. The last term models compartmentalization with block-copolymer potential.

For more details of the implementation, we suggest to our users to read the method paper of RepliSage.


## Requirements

RepliSage is a computationally and biophysically demanding project. It requires significant computing resources, both CPU and GPU. We recommend running RepliSage on high-performance workstations or HPC clusters equipped with a strong CPU and a GPU supporting CUDA (preferred) or at least OpenCL.

RepliSage is tested and supported on Debian-based Linux distributions.

Please note that even on powerful hardware, simulating a full cell cycle for a single chromosome with a polymer of 10,000 beads can take several hours to over a day. While the installation process is straightforward and thoroughly documented in our manual, running simulations will require patience and proper resources.

## Installation
It is needed to have at least python 3.10 and run,

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or more easily (do not forget to install it with python 3.10 or higher),

```
pip install pyRepliSage
```

## 🐳 Running RepliSage with Docker

To use RepliSage in a fully containerized and reproducible way, you can build and run it using Docker. This is a very efficient way when you want to use CUDA.

### Step 1: Build the Docker Image

Clone the repository and build the image:

```bash
docker build -t pyreplisage-cuda .
```

The `Dockerfile` can be found in the GitHub repo of RepliSage.

### Step 2: Run the Simulation

Use the following command to run your simulation:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --gpus all \
  -v "$PWD/config.ini:/app/config.ini:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/tmp:/app/output" \
  -v "$HOME/Data:/home/blackpianocat/Data:ro" \
  pyreplisage-cuda \
  python -m RepliSage.run -c /app/config.ini
```

**What this does:**

* `--rm`: Automatically removes the container after it finishes.
* `--gpus all`: It detects the gpus of the system.
* `-it`: Runs with an interactive terminal.
* `-v "$PWD/config.ini:/app/config.ini:ro"`: Mounts your local `config.ini` as read-only inside the container.
* `-v "$PWD/tmp:/app/output"`: Maps the `tmp/` directory for outputs.
* `-v "$HOME/Data:/home/blackpianocat/Data:ro"`: Mounts your full data directory so RepliSage can access input files.
* The final command runs RepliSage with your config file.

You do **not** need to manually stop or clean up anything—the container is temporary and self-destructs after it completes. The image (`pyreplisage-cuda`) remains available on your system and can be deleted anytime using:

```bash
docker rmi pyreplisage-cuda
```

**Note:** Install `nvidia-container-toolkit` in your system if you want to use the container with CUDA: https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html

## How to use?
The usage is very simple. To run this model you need to specify the parameters and the input data. Then RepliSage can do everything for you. 

Note that to run replisage it is needed to have `GM12878_single_cell_data_hg37.mat` data, for single-cell replication timing. These data are not produced by our laboratory, but they are alredy published in the paper of D. S. Massey et al. Please do not forget to cite them. We have uploaded the input data used in the paper here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PLA147eiHenOw_VojznnlC_ZywhLzGWx?usp=sharing.


### Input Data

#### Replication Timing Data
Single-cell replication timing data are imported automatically in RepliSage (into the directory `RepliSage/data`),
therefore it is not necessary to prepare them manually. However, in case you would like to use your own data, RepliSage understands Parquet format (for high compression).

Example structure of the expected Parquet data in `SC_REPT_PATH`:

```text
   chromosome   start     end   center  SC_1  SC_2  SC_3
0           1       0   20000    10000   1.0  NaN   2.0
1           1   20000   40000    30000   3.0  2.0   4.0
```

Each `SC_#` column corresponds to a single-cell replication state in the specified genomic window.

From these replication timing data, compartmentalization is also determined,
thus it is not required to run any separate compartment caller.

Alternativelly, the user can provide classical averaged replication timing curves in `REPT_PATH`. The truth is that the single-cell experiment does not add any significant information, and thus the user is free to choose the format they prefer.

The averaged replication timing data should be in `.txt` format  and look like this,

```txt
Chr 	 Coordinate 	 Replication Timing 
1	10257	-0.7371
1	15536	-0.6772
1	17346	-0.6566
1	30810	-0.5037
1	54126	-0.2384
1	57466	-0.2003
1	61854	-0.1502
1	67222	-0.0887
1	95431	0.236
1	100750	0.2976
1	103105	0.3249
1	107644	0.3776
1	109329	0.3972
1	112556	0.4348
1	115568	0.4698
```

Alternatively, `REPT_PATH` accepts `.BigWig` format. In this case it assumes Repli-Seq data, and applies logarithmic rescaling so as to fix the scewness of Repli-Seq data. This is probably the most common file format for replication timing data.

#### Loop interactions
The main assumption of this work is that the process of replication provides information about compartmentalization and epigenetic mark spreading, since replication timing is highly correlated with compartmentalization, and compartmentalization itself emerges as a macrostate of many interacting epigenetic domains following block-copolymer physics.

However, it is important that the user would specify a `.bedpe` file with loops. Therefore, in this case RepliSage follows a similar approach like LoopSage and the `.bedpe` file must be in the following format,

```

where the last two columns represent the probabilites for left and right anchor respectively to be tandem right. If the probability is negative it means that no CTCF motif was detected in this anchor. You can extract these probabilities from the repo: https://github.com/SFGLab/3d-analysis-toolkit, with `find_motifs.py` file. Please set `probabilistic=True` `statistics=False`.

### Directory Details

1. **`ensemble`**: Stores 3D structural ensembles categorized by cell cycle phase:
   - `G1`: Structures representing the pre-replication phase (with BR, before replication).
   - `S`: Structures captured during the replication phase (with R during replication).
   - `G2M`: Structures corresponding to the post-replication phase (with AR after replication).

2. **`metadata`**: Contains simulation data and intermediate outputs:
   - `energy_factors`: Numerical arrays for energy components (e.g., folding, Potts model).
   - `graph_metrics`: Graph-related metrics such as clustering coefficients and degree distributions.
   - `MCMC_output`: Results from the Monte Carlo simulation, including loop lengths and spin states.
   - `md_dynamics`: Files for molecular dynamics visualization (e.g., `.psf`, `.cif`).
   - `structural_metrics`: Structural properties like radius of gyration and contact probabilities.

3. **`plots`**: Includes visualizations and diagnostic plots:
   - `graph_metrics`: Graph-related metric plots (e.g., clustering coefficients).
   - `MCMC_diagnostics`: Diagnostics for the MCMC algorithm (e.g., autocorrelation).
   - `replication_simulation`: Visualizations of replication dynamics.
   - `structural_metrics`: Plots of structural properties (e.g., radius of gyration).

This directory structure ensures clear organization and facilitates efficient analysis of results, with data neatly separated by phase and type.

`params.txt` file contains information about the input parameters.

### Expected Results
#### Averaged loop diagram
RepliSage aims to model a very biophysically complex process: the cell-cycle. Because of that the results are very sensitive in the input parameters. Therefore, it is important to be able to understand the diagnostic plots, so as to be able to distinguish if the model's result have a biophysical meaning or not.

One of the most important diagnostic plots is the diagram of average loop length as a function of time (with decision intervals),

This plot shows us a very clear biophysical behavior:
- The simulation initially reaches the equillibrium in G1 phase.
- In S phase the average loop length is getting smaller because of the barrier activity of replication forks. This is a result which is also expected experimentally, as it is observed that during replication there is tendency that loops are getting shorter.
- After replication, in G2/M phase, condensins come into the game and they extrude loops faster. This means during this phase we excpect a different average loop length in equillibrium.

This is a very good plot, because we can see if there is equilibrium. In the previous example, we can see that the simulation reaches the equilibrium in G2/M phase. However, during G1 phase, maybe we should make more Monte Carlo steps so as to have more ensembles in equilibrium. S phase should always be out of equillibrium, but it is important to have enough steps for this phase as well, because replication forks are considered to be much slower than LEFs. 

#### Structural metrics
Previous two metrics were connected with the states of our graph, but they did not touch at all a very important aspect of modelling: the 3D structure. This is the reason why RepliSage outputs a set of sructural metrics as well. For example,

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc9af63a-541b-4203-b721-914eae7dd633)

These plots show us that during S phase replication forks are detaching the two replicates from each other. This effect in combination to the excluded volume causes less compacted structure. After S phase, in G2/M phase there is further compactions due to the interplay of: excluded volume, block-copolymer forces and long range condensin loops.
