# GitHub Security Lab Taskflow Agent

The Security Lab Taskflow Agent is an MCP enabled multi-Agent framework.

The Taskflow Agent is built on top of the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/).

## Core Concepts

The Taskflow Agent leverages a GitHub Workflow-esque YAML based grammar to perform a series of tasks using a set of Agents.

Its primary value proposition is as a CLI tool that allows users to quickly define and script Agentic workflows without having to write any code.

Agents are defined through [personalities](examples/personalities/), that receive a [task](examples/taskflows/) to complete, given a set of [tools](src/seclab_taskflow_agent/toolboxes/).

Agents can cooperate to complete sequences of tasks through so-called [taskflows](doc/GRAMMAR.md).

You can find a detailed overview of the taskflow grammar [here](doc/GRAMMAR.md) and example taskflows [here](examples/taskflows/).

## Use Cases and Examples

The Seclab Taskflow Agent framework was primarily designed to fit the iterative feedback loop driven work involved in Agentic security research workflows and vulnerability triage tasks.

Its design philosophy is centered around the belief that a prompt level focus of capturing vulnerability patterns will greatly improve and scale security research results as frontier model capabilities evolve over time.

At GitHub Security Lab, we primarily use this framework as a code auditing tool, but it can also serve as a more generic swiss army knife for exploring Agentic workflows. For example, we also use this framework for automated code scanning alert triage.

The framework includes a [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) MCP server that can be used for Agentic code review, see the [CVE-2023-2283](examples/taskflows/CVE-2023-2283.yaml) taskflow for an example of how to have an Agent review C code using a CodeQL database ([demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRSPSVW8RMo)).

Instead of generating CodeQL queries itself, the CodeQL MCP Server is used to provide CodeQL-query based MCP tools that allow an Agent to navigate and explore code. It leverages templated CodeQL queries to provide targeted context for model driven code analysis.

## Requirements

Python >= 3.10 or Docker

## Configuration

Provide a GitHub token for an account that is entitled to use [GitHub Models](https://models.github.ai) via the `AI_API_TOKEN` environment variable. Further configuration is use case dependent, i.e. pending which MCP servers you'd like to use in your taskflows. In a terminal, you can add `AI_API_TOKEN` to the environment like this:

```sh
export AI_API_TOKEN=<your_github_token>
```

Or, if you are using GitHub Codespaces, then you can [add a Codespace secret](https://github.com/settings/codespaces/secrets/new) so that `AI_API_TOKEN` is automatically available when working in a Codespace.

Many of the MCP servers in the [seclab-taskflow](https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/seclab-taskflows) repo also need an environment variable named `GH_TOKEN` for accessing the GitHub API. You can use two separate PATs if you want, or you can use one PAT for both purposes, like this:

```sh
export GH_TOKEN=$AI_API_TOKEN
```

We do not recommend storing secrets on disk, but you can persist non-sensitive environment variables by adding a `.env` file in the project root.

Example:

```sh
# MCP configs
CODEQL_DBS_BASE_PATH="/app/my_data/codeql_databases"
AI_API_ENDPOINT="https://models.github.ai/inference"
```

## Deploying from Source

We use [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/) to build the project. Download and build like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/seclab-taskflow-agent.git
cd seclab-taskflow-agent
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install hatch
hatch build
```

Then run `hatch run main`.

Example: deploying a prompt to an Agent Personality:

```sh
hatch run main -p seclab_taskflow_agent.personalities.assistant 'explain modems to me please'
```

Example: deploying a Taskflow:

```sh
hatch run main -t examples.taskflows.example
```

Example: deploying a Taskflow with command line global variables:

```sh
hatch run main -t examples.taskflows.example_globals -g fruit=apples
```

Multiple global variables can be set:

```sh
hatch run main -t examples.taskflows.example_globals -g fruit=apples -g color=red
```

## Deploying from Docker

You can deploy the Taskflow Agent via its Docker image using `docker/run.sh`.

WARNING: the Agent Docker image is _NOT_ intended as a security boundary but strictly a deployment convenience.

The image entrypoint is `__main__.py` and thus it operates the same as invoking the Agent from source directly.

You can find the Docker image for the Seclab Taskflow Agent [here](https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/seclab-taskflow-agent/pkgs/container/seclab-taskflow-agent) and how it is built [here](release_tools/).

Note that this image is based on a public release of the Taskflow Agent, and you will have to mount any custom taskflows, personalities, or prompts into the image for them to be available to the Agent.

Optional image mount points to supply custom data are configured via the environment:

- Custom data via `MY_DATA`, mounts to `/app/my_data`
- Custom personalities via `MY_PERSONALITIES`, mounts to `/app/personalities/my_personalities`
- Custom taskflows via `MY_TASKFLOWS`, mounts to `/app/taskflows/my_taskflows`
- Custom prompts via `MY_PROMPTS`, mounts to `/app/prompts/my_prompts`
- Custom toolboxes via `MY_TOOLBOXES`, mounts to `/app/toolboxes/my_toolboxes`

See [docker/run.sh](docker/run.sh) for further details.

Example: deploying a Taskflow (example.yaml):

```sh
docker/run.sh -t example
```

Example: deploying a Taskflow with global variables:

```sh
docker/run.sh -t example_globals -g fruit=apples
```

Example: deploying a custom taskflow (custom_taskflow.yaml):

```sh
MY_TASKFLOWS=~/my_taskflows docker/run.sh -t custom_taskflow
```

Example: deploying a custom taskflow (custom_taskflow.yaml) and making local CodeQL databases available to the CodeQL MCP server:

```sh
MY_TASKFLOWS=~/my_taskflows MY_DATA=~/app/my_data CODEQL_DBS_BASE_PATH=/app/my_data/codeql_databases docker/run.sh -t custom_taskflow
```

For more advanced scenarios like e.g. making custom MCP server code available, you can alter the run script to mount your custom code into the image and configure your toolboxes to use said code accordingly.

```sh
export MY_MCP_SERVERS="$PWD"/mcp_servers
export MY_TOOLBOXES="$PWD"/toolboxes
export MY_PERSONALITIES="$PWD"/personalities
export MY_TASKFLOWS="$PWD"/taskflows
export MY_PROMPTS="$PWD"/prompts
export MY_DATA="$PWD"/data

if [ ! -f ".env" ]; then
    touch ".env"
fi

docker run \
       --mount type=bind,src="$PWD"/.env,dst=/app/.env,ro \
       ${MY_DATA:+--mount type=bind,src=$MY_DATA,dst=/app/my_data} \
       ${MY_MCP_SERVERS:+--mount type=bind,src=$MY_MCP_SERVERS,dst=/app/my_mcp_servers,ro} \
       ${MY_TASKFLOWS:+--mount type=bind,src=$MY_TASKFLOWS,dst=/app/taskflows/my_taskflows,ro} \
       ${MY_TOOLBOXES:+--mount type=bind,src=$MY_TOOLBOXES,dst=/app/toolboxes/my_toolboxes,ro} \
       ${MY_PROMPTS:+--mount type=bind,src=$MY_PROMPTS,dst=/app/prompts/my_prompts,ro} \
       ${MY_PERSONALITIES:+--mount type=bind,src=$MY_PERSONALITIES,dst=/app/personalities/my_personalities,ro} \
       "ghcr.io/githubsecuritylab/seclab-taskflow-agent" "$@"
```

## General YAML file headers

Every YAML files used by the Seclab Taskflow Agent must include a header like this:

```yaml
seclab-taskflow-agent:
  version: 1
  filetype: taskflow
```

The `version` number in the header should always be 1. It means that the
file uses version 1 of the seclab-taskflow-agent syntax. If we ever need
to make a major change to the syntax, then we'll update the version number.
This will hopefully enable us to make changes without breaking backwards
compatibility.

The `filetype` determines whether the file defines a personality, toolbox, etc.
This means that different types of files can be stored in the same directory.
A `filetype` can be one of the following:
  - taskflow
  - personality
  - toolbox
  - prompt
  - model_config

We'll now explain the role of different types of files and functionalities available to them.

## Personalities

Core characteristics for a single Agent. Configured through YAML files of `filetype` `personality`.

These are system prompt level instructions.

Example:

```yaml
# personalities define the system prompt level directives for this Agent
seclab-taskflow-agent:
  version: 1
  filetype: personality

personality: |
  You are a simple echo bot. You use echo tools to echo things.

task: |
  Echo user inputs using the echo tools.

# personality toolboxes map to mcp servers made available to this Agent
toolboxes:
  - seclab_taskflow_agent.toolboxes.echo
```

In the above, the `personality` and `task` field specifies the system prompt to be used whenever this `personality` is used.
The `toolboxes` are the tools that are available to this `personality`. The `toolboxes` should be a list of files of the `filetype` `toolbox`. (See the [Import paths](#import-paths) section for how to reference other files.)

Personalities can be used in two ways. First it can be used standalone with a prompt input from the command line:

```
hatch run main -p examples.personalities.echo 'echo this message'
```

In this case, `personality` and `task` from [`examples/personalities/echo.yaml`](examples/personalities/echo.yaml) are used as the
system prompt while the user argument `echo this message` is used as a user prompt. In this use case, the only tools that this
personality has access to is the `toolboxes` specified in the file.

Personalities can also be used in a `taskflow` to perform tasks. This is done by adding the `personality` to the `agents` field in a `taskflow` file:

```yaml
taskflow:
  - task:
      ...
      agents:
        - personalities.assistant
      user_prompt: |
        Fetch all the open pull requests from `github/codeql` github repository.
        You do not need to provide a summary of the results.
      toolboxes:
        - seclab_taskflow_agent.toolboxes.github_official
```

In this case, the `personality` specified in `agents` provides the system prompt and the user prompt is specified in the `user_prompt` field of the task. A big difference in this case is that the `toolboxes` specified in the `task` will overwrite the `toolboxes` that the `personality` has access to. So in the above example, the `personalities.assistant` will have access to the `seclab_taskflow_agent.toolboxes.github_official` toolbox instead of its own toolbox. It is important to note that the `personalities` toolboxes get *overwritten* in this case, so whenever a `toolboxes` field is provided in a `task`, it'll use the provided toolboxes and `personality` loses access to its own toolboxes. e.g.

```yaml
taskflow:
  - task:
      ...
      agents:
        - examples.personalities.echo
      user_prompt: |
        echo this
      toolboxes:
        - seclab_taskflow_agent.toolboxes.github_official
```

In the above `task`, `personalities.examples.echo` will only have access to the `toolboxes.github_official` and can no longer access the `seclab_taskflow_agent.toolboxes.echo` `toolbox` (unless it is added also in the `task` `toolboxes`).

## Toolboxes

MCP servers that provide tools. Configured through YAML files of `filetype` `toolbox`. These are files that provide the type and parameters to start an MCP server.

For example, to start a stdio MCP server that is implemented in a python file:

```yaml
# stdio mcp server configuration
seclab-taskflow-agent:
  version: 1
  filetype: toolbox

server_params:
  kind: stdio
  command: python
  args: ["-m", "seclab_taskflow_agent.mcp_servers.echo.echo"]
  env:
    TEST: value
```

In the above, `command` and `args` are just the command and arguments that should be run to start the MCP server. Environment variables can be passed using the `env` field.

A [streamable](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) is also supported by setting the `kind` to `streamable`:

```yaml
server_params:
  kind: streamable
  url: https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/
  #See https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/blob/main/docs/remote-server.md
  headers:
    Authorization: "{{ env GITHUB_AUTH_HEADER }}"
  optional_headers:
    X-MCP-Toolsets: "{{ env GITHUB_MCP_TOOLSETS }}"
    X-MCP-Readonly: "{{ env GITHUB_MCP_READONLY }}"
```

You can force certain tools within a `toolbox` to require user confirmation to run. This can be helpful if a tool may perform irreversible actions and should require user approval prior to its use. This is done by including the name of the tool (function) in the MCP server in the `confirm` section:

```yaml
server_params:
  kind: stdio
  ...
# the list of tools that you want the framework to confirm with the user before executing
# use this to guard rail any potentially dangerous functions from MCP servers
confirm:
  - memcache_clear_cache
```

## Taskflows

A sequence of interdependent tasks performed by a set of Agents. Configured through YAML files of `filetype` `taskflow`.
Taskflows supports a number of features, and their details can be found [here](doc/GRAMMAR.md).

Example:

```yaml
seclab-taskflow-agent:
  version: 1
  filetype: taskflow

taskflow:
  - task:
      # taskflows can optionally choose any of the models supported by your API for a task
      model: gpt-4.1
      # taskflows can optionally limit the max allowed number of Agent task loop
      # iterations to complete a task, this defaults to 50 when not provided
      max_steps: 20
      must_complete: true
      # taskflows can set a primary (first entry) and handoff (additional entries) agent
      agents:
        - seclab_taskflow_agent.personalities.c_auditer
        - examples.personalities.fruit_expert
      user_prompt: |
        Store an example vulnerable C program that uses `strcpy` in the
        `vulnerable_c_example` memory key and explain why `strcpy`
        is insecure in the C programming language. Do this before handing off
        to any other agent.

        Finally, why are apples and oranges healthy to eat?

      # taskflows can set temporary environment variables, these support the general
      # "{{ env FROM_EXISTING_ENVIRONMENT }" pattern we use elsewhere as well
      # these environment variables can then be made available to any stdio mcp server
      # through its respective yaml configuration, see memcache.yaml for an example
      # you can use these to override top-level environment variables on a per-task basis
      env:
        MEMCACHE_STATE_DIR: "example_taskflow/"
        MEMCACHE_BACKEND: "dictionary_file"
      # taskflows can optionally override personality toolboxes, in this example
      # this normally only has the memcache toolbox, but we extend it here with
      # the GHSA toolbox
      toolboxes:
        - seclab_taskflow_agent.toolboxes.memcache
        - seclab_taskflow_agent.toolboxes.codeql
  - task:
      must_complete: true
      model: gpt-4.1
      agents:
        - seclab_taskflow_agent.personalities.c_auditer
      user_prompt: |
        Retrieve C code for security review from the `vulnerable_c_example`
        memory key and perform a review.

        Clear the memory cache when you're done.
      env:
        MEMCACHE_STATE_DIR: "example_taskflow/"
        MEMCACHE_BACKEND: "dictionary_file"
      toolboxes:
        - seclab_taskflow_agent.toolboxes.memcache
      # headless mode does not prompt for tool call confirms configured for a server
      # note: this will auto-allow, if you want control over potentially dangerous
      # tool calls, then you should NOT run a task in headless mode (default: false)
      headless: true
  - task:
      # tasks can also run shell scripts that return e.g. json output for repeat prompt iterable
      must_complete: true
      run: |
        echo '["apple", "banana", "orange"]'
  - task:
      repeat_prompt: true
      agents:
        - seclab_taskflow_agent.personalities.assistant
      user_prompt: |
        What kind of fruit is {{ RESULT }}?
```

Taskflows support [Agent handoffs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/handoffs/). Handoffs are useful for implementing triage patterns where the primary Agent can decide to handoff a task to any subsequent Agents in the `Agents` list.

See the [taskflow examples](examples/taskflows) for other useful Taskflow patterns such as repeatable and asynchronous templated prompts.


You can run a taskflow from the command line like this:

```
hatch run main -t examples.taskflows.CVE-2023-2283
```

## Prompts

Prompts are configured through YAML files of `filetype` `prompt`. They define a reusable prompt that can be referenced in `taskflow` files.

They contain only one field, the `prompt` field, which is used to replace any `{{ PROMPT_<import-path> }}` template parameter in a taskflow. For example, the following `prompt`.

```yaml
seclab-taskflow-agent:
  version: 1
  filetype: prompt

prompt: |
  Tell me more about bananas as well.
```

would replace any `{{ PROMPT_examples.prompts.example_prompt }}` template parameter found in the `user_prompt` section in a taskflow:

```yaml
  - task:
      agents:
        - examples.personalities.fruit_expert
      user_prompt: |
        Tell me more about apples.

        {{ PROMPTS_examples.prompts.example_prompt }}
```

becomes:

```yaml
  - task:
      agents:
        - examples.personalities.fruit_expert
      user_prompt: |
        Tell me more about apples.

        Tell me more about bananas as well.
```

## Model configs

Model configs are configured through YAML files of `filetype` `model_config`. These provide a way to configure model versions.

```yaml
seclab-taskflow-agent:
  version: 1
  filetype: model_config
models:
  gpt_latest: gpt-5
```

A `model_config` file can be used in a `taskflow` and the values defined in `models` can then be used throughout.

```yaml
model_config: examples.model_configs.model_config

taskflow:
  - task:
      model: gpt_latest
```

The model version can then be updated by changing `gpt_latest` in the `model_config` file and applied across all taskflows that use the config.

In addition, model specific parameters can be provided via `model_config`. To do so, define a `model_settings` section in the `model_config` file. This section has to be a dictionary with the model names as keys:

```yaml
model_settings:
  gpt_latest:
    temperature: 1
    reasoning:
      effort: high
```

You do not need to set parameters for all models defined in the `models` section. When parameters are not set for a model, they'll fall back to the default value. However, all the settings in this section must belong to one of the models specified in the `models` section, otherwise an error will raise:

```yaml
model_settings:
  new_model:
    ...
```

The above will result in an error because `new_model` is not defined in `models` section. Model parameters can also be set per task, and any settings defined in a task will override the settings in the config.

## Passing environment variables

Files of types `taskflow` and `toolbox` allow environment variables to be passed using the `env` field:

```yaml
server_params:
  ...
  env:
    CODEQL_DBS_BASE_PATH: "{{ env CODEQL_DBS_BASE_PATH }}"
    # prevent git repo operations on gh codeql executions
    GH_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER: "disable"
```

For `toolbox`, `env` can be used inside `server_params`. A template of the form `{{ env ENV_VARIABLE_NAME }}` can be used to pass values of the environment variable from the current process to the MCP server. So in the above, the MCP server is run with `GH_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=disable` and passes the value of `CODEQL_DBS_BASE_PATH` from the current process to the MCP server. The templated paramater `{{ env CODEQL_DBS_BASE_PATH }}` is replaced by the value of the environment variable `CODEQL_DBS_BASE_PATH` in the current process.

Similarly, environment variables can be passed to a `task` in a `taskflow`:

```yaml
taskflow:
  - task:
      must_complete: true
      agents:
        - seclab_taskflow_agent.personalities.assistant
      user_prompt: |
        Store the json array ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"] in the `fruits` memory key.
      env:
        MEMCACHE_STATE_DIR: "example_taskflow/"
        MEMCACHE_BACKEND: "dictionary_file"
```

This overwrites the environment variables `MEMCACHE_STATE_DIR` and `MEMCACHE_BACKEND` for the task only. A template `{{ env ENV_VARIABLE_NAME }}` can also be used.

Note that when using the template `{{ env ENV_VARIABLE_NAME }}`, `ENV_VARIABLE_NAME` must be the name of an environment variable in the current process.

## Import paths

YAML files often need to refer to each other. For example, a taskflow can reference a personality like this:

```yaml
taskflow:
  - task:
      ...
      agents:
        - seclab_taskflow_agent.personalities.assistant
```

We use Python's import system, so a name like `seclab_taskflow_agent.personalities.assistant` will get resolved to a YAML file using Python's import rules. One of the benefits of this is that it makes it easy to bundle and share taskflows as Python packages on PyPI.

The implementation works like this:

1. A name like `seclab_taskflow_agent.personalities.assistant` gets split (at the last `.` character) into a package name (`seclab_taskflow_agent.personalities`) and a file name (`assistant`).
2. Python's [`importlib.resources.files`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.html#importlib.resources.files) is used to resolve the package name into a directory name.
3. The extension `.yaml` is added to the filename: `assistant.yaml`.
4. The yaml file is loaded from the directory that was returned by `importlib.resources.files`.

The exact code that implements this can be found in [`available_tools.py`](src/seclab_taskflow_agent/available_tools.py).
