# py-youtube-search

A lightweight, zero-dependency Python library to search YouTube videos programmatically without an API key. This library uses standard Python libraries (`urllib` and `re`) to scrape search results, making it fast, robust, and easy to integrate into any project.

## Features

- **No API Key Required**: Search YouTube directly without setting up Google Cloud projects or billing.
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Built entirely using Python's standard library (`urllib`, `re`). No `requests`, `selenium`, or `beautifulsoup` needed.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Built-in support for duration (Medium 3-20m, Long >20m) and upload date filters (Today, Week, Month, Year).
- **Rich Data Extraction**: Robustly extracts Video ID, Title, Duration, and View Count.

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```bash
pip install py-youtube-search
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Basic Search
Fetch the top results for any keyword.

```python
from py_youtube_search import YouTubeSearch

# Search for the top 5 results for "Python tutorials"
search = YouTubeSearch("Python tutorials", limit=5)
videos = search.videos()

for v in videos:
    print(f"Title: {v['title']}")
    print(f"Duration: {v['duration']}")
    print(f"Views: {v['views']}")
    print(f"Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={v['id']}\n")
```

### 2. Advanced Search with Filters
Search for specific types of content, such as long-form tutorials uploaded this week.

```python
from py_youtube_search import YouTubeSearch, Filters

# Search for "LangGraph" videos over 20 minutes long, uploaded this week
# Use the Filters class to access constants
search = YouTubeSearch("LangGraph", sp=Filters.long_this_week, limit=3)
videos = search.videos()

for v in videos:
    print(f"🎥 {v['title']} | ⏱ {v['duration']} | 👁 {v['views']}")
```

## Available Filters

You can access these filters using the `Filters` class (e.g., `Filters.long_today`).

### Duration: Medium (3 - 20 Minutes)
| Filter Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Filters.medium_today` | Uploaded **Today** |
| `Filters.medium_this_week` | Uploaded **This Week** |
| `Filters.medium_this_month` | Uploaded **This Month** |
| `Filters.medium_this_year` | Uploaded **This Year** |

### Duration: Long (Over 20 Minutes)
| Filter Attribute | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Filters.long_today` | Uploaded **Today** |
| `Filters.long_this_week` | Uploaded **This Week** |
| `Filters.long_this_month` | Uploaded **This Month** |
| `Filters.long_this_year` | Uploaded **This Year** |

## Data Structure

The `videos()` method returns a list of dictionaries with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "lDoYisPfcck",
    "title": "Hack the planet! LangGraph AI HackBot Dev & Q/A",
    "duration": "1:05:23",
    "views": "1.2K views",
    "url_suffix": "/watch?v=lDoYisPfcck"
  },
  {
    "id": "5LXLmUsEM20",
    "title": "LangGraph Workflow Patterns - Part 1/10",
    "duration": "42 seconds",
    "views": "500 views",
    "url_suffix": "/watch?v=5LXLmUsEM20"
  }
]
