class DeviceConnection:
    """Connection to a LIFX device.

    This class manages the UDP transport and request/response lifecycle for
    a single device. Connections are opened lazily on first request and
    remain open until explicitly closed.

    Features:
    - Lazy connection opening (no context manager required)
    - Async generator-based request/response streaming
    - Retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter
    - Request serialization to prevent response mixing
    - Automatic sequence number management

    Example:
        ```python
        conn = DeviceConnection(serial="d073d5123456", ip="192.168.1.100")

        # Connection opens automatically on first request
        state = await conn.request(packets.Light.GetColor())
        # state.label is already decoded to string
        # state.color is LightHsbk instance

        # Optionally close when done
        await conn.close()
        ```

    With context manager (recommended for cleanup):
        ```python
        async with DeviceConnection(...) as conn:
            state = await conn.request(packets.Light.GetColor())
        # Connection automatically closed on exit
        ```

        This is a convenience method that returns the first response from

        Most device operations use this method since they expect a single response.

            LifxTimeoutError: If no response within timeout
            LifxProtocolError: If response invalid
            LifxConnectionError: If connection fails
