# Dataset viewer (GUI hook extension)

`brkraw-viewer` is an optional GUI extension that plugs into BrkRaw to provide
interactive tools for raw-data workflows. It is designed as a GUI hook layer
so new UI features can be added without changing core BrkRaw logic.

The viewer focuses on tasks like orientation QC/reorientation, interactive
metadata and spec inspection, naming-policy checks, and config editing. This
keeps the core CLI/API reproducible while enabling richer GUI-based workflows
when needed.
