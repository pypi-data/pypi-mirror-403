[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/EmmanuelNiyonshuti/whatdeps/graph/badge.svg?token=6HA3SJLM0F)](https://codecov.io/gh/EmmanuelNiyonshuti/whatdeps)

A small Python tool that scans your project’s dependency files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements` files) and shows:
- release dates from PyPI
- supported Python versions
- GitHub activity (issues, recent pushes and number of stars)

It only looks at dependencies that are **on PyPI** and **hosted on GitHub**.
