"""Test that CLI tool commands exit cleanly without hanging.

This test ensures that CLI commands properly clean up database connections
on exit, preventing process hangs. See GitHub issue for details.

The issue occurs when:
1. ensure_initialization() calls asyncio.run(initialize_app())
2. initialize_app() creates global database connections via db.get_or_create_db()
3. When asyncio.run() completes, the event loop closes
4. But the global database engine holds async connections that prevent clean exit
5. Process hangs indefinitely

The fix ensures db.shutdown_db() is called before asyncio.run() returns.
