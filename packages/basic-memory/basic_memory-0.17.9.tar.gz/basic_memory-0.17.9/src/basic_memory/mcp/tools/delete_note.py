            The note '{identifier}' could not be found for deletion in {project}.

            ## This might mean:
            1. **Already deleted**: The note may have been deleted previously
            2. **Wrong identifier**: The identifier format might be incorrect
            3. **Different project**: The note might be in a different project

            ## How to verify:
            1. **Search for the note**: Use `search_notes("{project}", "{search_term}")` to find it
            2. **Try different formats**:
               - If you used a permalink like "folder/note-title", try just the title: "{title_format}"
               - If you used a title, try the permalink format: "{permalink_format}"

            3. **Check if already deleted**: Use `list_directory("/")` to see what notes exist
            4. **List notes in project**: Use `list_directory("/")` to see what notes exist in the current project

            ## If the note actually exists:
            ```
            # First, find the correct identifier:
            search_notes("{project}", "{identifier}")

            # Then delete using the correct identifier:
            delete_note("{project}", "correct-identifier-from-search")
            ```

            Use search to find all related notes and delete them one by one.

## How to resolve:
1. **Check permissions**: Verify you have delete/write access to this project

3. **Project access**: Ensure you're in the correct project with proper permissions

## Alternative actions:
- List available projects: `list_memory_projects()`
- Specify the correct project: `delete_note("{identifier}", project="project-name")`
- Verify note exists first: `read_note("{identifier}", project="project-name")`

2. **Check file status**: Verify the file isn't locked or in use
3. **Check disk space**: Ensure the system has adequate storage

## Troubleshooting:
- Verify note exists: `read_note("{project}","{identifier}")`
- Try again in a few moments

1. **Sync conflict**: The file system and database are out of sync
2. **Database lock**: Another operation is accessing the database
3. **Corrupted entry**: The database entry might be corrupted

## Steps to resolve:
1. **Try again**: Wait a moment and retry the deletion
2. **Check note status**: `read_note("{project}","{identifier}")` to see current state
3. **Manual verification**: Use `list_directory()` to see if file still exists

Error deleting note '{identifier}': {error_message}

## General troubleshooting:
1. **Verify the note exists**: `read_note("{project}", "{identifier}")` or `search_notes("{project}", "{identifier}")`
2. **Check permissions**: Ensure you can edit/delete files in this project
3. **Try again**: The error might be temporary
4. **Check project**: Make sure you're in the correct project

## Step-by-step approach:
```
# 1. Confirm note exists and get correct identifier
search_notes("{project}", "{identifier}")

# 2. Read the note to verify access
read_note("{project}", "correct-identifier-from-search")

# 3. Try deletion with correct identifier
delete_note("{project}", "correct-identifier-from-search")
```

## Alternative approaches:
- Check what notes exist: `list_directory("{project}", "/")`

    """Delete a note from the knowledge base.

    Permanently removes a note from the specified project. The note is identified
    by title or permalink. If the note doesn't exist, the operation returns False
    without error. If deletion fails due to other issues, helpful error messages are provided.

    Project Resolution:
    Server resolves projects in this order: Single Project Mode → project parameter → default project.
    If project unknown, use list_memory_projects() or recent_activity() first.

    Args:
        project: Project name to delete from. Optional - server will resolve using hierarchy.
                If unknown, use list_memory_projects() to discover available projects.
        identifier: Note title or permalink to delete
                   Can be a title like "Meeting Notes" or permalink like "notes/meeting-notes"
        context: Optional FastMCP context for performance caching.

    Returns:
        True if note was successfully deleted, False if note was not found.
        On errors, returns a formatted string with helpful troubleshooting guidance.

    Examples:
        # Delete by title
        delete_note("my-project", "Meeting Notes: Project Planning")

        # Delete by permalink
        delete_note("work-docs", "notes/project-planning")

        # Delete with exact path
        delete_note("research", "experiments/ml-model-results")

        # Common usage pattern
        if delete_note("my-project", "old-draft"):
            print("Note deleted successfully")
        else:
            print("Note not found or already deleted")

    Raises:
        HTTPError: If project doesn't exist or is inaccessible
        SecurityError: If identifier attempts path traversal

    Warning:
        This operation is permanent and cannot be undone. The note file
        will be removed from the filesystem and all references will be lost.

    Note:
        If the note is not found, this function provides helpful error messages
        with suggestions for finding the correct identifier, including search
        commands and alternative formats to try.
