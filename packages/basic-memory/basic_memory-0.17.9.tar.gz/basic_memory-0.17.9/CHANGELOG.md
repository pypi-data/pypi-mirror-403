🤖 Available projects:
   • main (current, default)
   • work-notes
   • personal-journal
   • code-snippets

💬 "Switch to work-notes"
🤖 ✓ Switched to work-notes project
   
   Project Summary:

#### 2. Advanced Note Editing 

**Edit notes incrementally without rewriting entire documents:**

```python
# Append new sections to existing notes
edit_note("project-planning", "append", "\n## New Requirements\n- Feature X\n- Feature Y")

# Prepend timestamps to meeting notes
edit_note("meeting-notes", "prepend", "## 2025-05-27 Update\n- Progress update...")

# Replace specific sections under headers
edit_note("api-spec", "replace_section", "New implementation details", section="## Implementation")
