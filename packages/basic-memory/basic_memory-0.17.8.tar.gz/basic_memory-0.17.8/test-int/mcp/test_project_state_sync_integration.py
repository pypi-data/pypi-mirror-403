"""Integration test for project state synchronization between MCP session and CLI config.

This test validates the fix for GitHub issue #148 where MCP session and CLI commands
had inconsistent project state, causing "Project not found" errors and edit failures.

The test simulates the exact workflow reported in the issue:
1. MCP server starts with a default project
2. Default project is changed via CLI/API
3. MCP tools should immediately use the new project (no restart needed)
4. All operations should work consistently in the new project context
