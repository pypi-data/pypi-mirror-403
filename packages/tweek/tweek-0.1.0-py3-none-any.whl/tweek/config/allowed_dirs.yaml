# This file controls WHERE Tweek hooks are active.
# This is a SAFETY FEATURE to prevent accidental activation in production.
#
# Options:
#   global_enabled: true  - Activate Tweek everywhere (production mode)
#   allowed_directories:  - List of directories where Tweek activates
#
# IMPORTANT: Without this file, Tweek is DISABLED everywhere.

# Set to true to enable Tweek globally (for production deployment)
global_enabled: false

# Directories where Tweek hooks will activate
# Tweek will also activate in subdirectories of these paths
allowed_directories:
  # Test environment only (safe for development)
  - ~/AI/tweek/test-environment

  # Add more directories as needed:
  # - ~/projects/sensitive-project
  # - /path/to/another/project
