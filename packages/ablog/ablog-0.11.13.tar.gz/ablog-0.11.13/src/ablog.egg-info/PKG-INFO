The original project is no longer maintained and the `SunPy Project <https://www.sunpy.org>`__ has taken over maintenance.

**This version is maintained with the aim to keep it working for SunPy Project website and thus new features or bugfixes are highly unlikely unless they directly impact the SunPy Project**
