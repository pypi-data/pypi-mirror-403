## Features

- Zero-copy data sharing between Rust and Python when possible
- Support for common numeric types (f32, f64, i32, i64, etc.)
- Complex number support
- Multi-dimensional array support

## Usage

This crate is primarily used internally by the scirs2-python bindings. For direct usage, see the scirs2-python package.
