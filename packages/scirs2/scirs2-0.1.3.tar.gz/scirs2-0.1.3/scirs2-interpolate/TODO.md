## ✅ Recent Fixes (v0.1.3)

### GitHub Issues Resolved
- ✅ **Issue #96: PCHIP Extrapolation Bug** (Fixed 2026-01-16, Released v0.1.3)
  - **Problem:** PCHIP extrapolation returned -24008 for x=50 with monotonic data [0,1,4,9]
  - **Root Cause:** Cubic polynomial extrapolation produced explosive values outside data range
  - **Solution:** Implemented linear extrapolation using endpoint derivatives
  - **Impact:** Stable, monotonicity-preserving extrapolation for all PCHIP use cases
  - **Commit:** 49817afbd - "Enhance PCHIP extrapolation with linear extension"
  - **Tests Added:**
    - `test_pchip_extrapolation_far_beyond_range()` - Validates x=50 case
    - `test_pchip_extrapolation_linear_behavior()` - Verifies linear slope
  - **Files Modified:** `src/interp1d/pchip.rs` (lines 138-149, 491-556)
  - **Reference:** https://github.com/cool-japan/scirs/issues/96
