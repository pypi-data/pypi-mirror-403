              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Command-Line Interface

You can preprocess, train and use models, and perform harmonization using the command-line interface.


## MRIdataset Class

The `MRIdataset` class in `cvasl.dataset` is designed to load and preprocess MRI datasets for harmonization and analysis. It supports loading data from CSV files, preprocessing steps like feature dropping, categorical encoding, and adding derived features (ICV, decade).

**MRIdataset Initialization Parameters:**

*   `path` (str or list): Path to the CSV file or a list of paths for datasets spanning multiple files (e.g., for datasets like Site0 which might be spread across 'TOP_input.csv' and 'StrokeMRI_input.csv').
*   `site_id` (int or str): Identifier for the data acquisition site. This is crucial for harmonization to distinguish between datasets from different sites.
*   `patient_identifier` (str, optional): Column name that uniquely identifies each patient. Defaults to `"participant_id"`.
*   `features_to_drop` (list, optional): List of feature names (columns) to be dropped from the dataset during preprocessing. Defaults to `["m0", "id"]`.
*   `cat_features_to_encode` (list, optional): List of categorical feature names to be encoded into numerical representations. This is important for harmonizers and models that require numerical input. Defaults to `None`.
*   `ICV` (bool, optional): If `True`, adds Intracranial Volume (ICV) related features, assuming 'gm\_vol' and 'gm\_icvratio' columns are available. Defaults to `False`.
*   `decade` (bool, optional): If `True`, adds a 'decade' feature derived from the 'age' column. Defaults to `False`.
*   `features_to_bin` (list, optional): List of features to be binned. Defaults to `None`.
*   `binning_method` (str, optional): Method for binning, either `"equal_width"` or `"equal_frequency"`. Defaults to `"equal_width"`.
*   `num_bins` (int, optional): Number of bins to create for binning. Defaults to `10`.
*   `bin_labels` (list, optional): Custom labels for the bins. Defaults to `None`.

Example of creating `MRIdataset` objects in `runharmonize.py`:

```python
Site0_path = ['../data/Site001_input.csv','../data/Site002_input.csv']
Site1_path = '../data/Site1_input.csv'
Site2_path = '../data/Site2_input.csv'
Site3_path = '../data/Site3_input.csv'
Site4_path = '../data/Site4_input.csv'

features_to_drop = ["m0", "id"]
features_to_map = ['readout', 'labelling', 'sex']
patient_identifier = 'participant_id'

Site0 = MRIdataset(Site0_path, site_id=3, decade=True, ICV = True, patient_identifier=patient_identifier, features_to_drop=features_to_drop)
Site1 = MRIdataset(Site1_path, site_id=0, decade=True, ICV = True, patient_identifier=patient_identifier, features_to_drop=features_to_drop)
Site2 = MRIdataset(Site2_path, site_id=1, decade=True, ICV = True, patient_identifier=patient_identifier, features_to_drop=features_to_drop)
Site3 = MRIdataset(Site3_path, site_id=2, decade=True, ICV = True, patient_identifier=patient_identifier, features_to_drop=features_to_drop)
Site4 = MRIdataset(Site4_path, site_id=4, decade=True, ICV = True, patient_identifier=patient_identifier, features_to_drop=features_to_drop)

datasets = [Site0, Site1, Site2, Site3, Site4]
[_d.preprocess() for _d in datasets] # Preprocess all datasets
datasets = encode_cat_features(datasets,features_to_map) # Encode categorical features across datasets
```

## Harmonization Methods

The `cvasl.harmonizers` module provides several harmonization techniques to reduce site-specific variance in MRI data. Below is a guide to the available harmonizers and how to run them via the command-line interface using `harmonizer_cli.py`.

### Running Harmonization via CLI

To run harmonization, use the `harmonizer_cli.py` script with the following general command structure:

```bash
python harmonizer_cli.py --dataset_paths <dataset_paths> --site_ids <site_ids> --method <harmonization_method> [harmonizer_specific_options] [dataset_options]
```

*   `--dataset_paths`: Comma-separated paths to your dataset CSV files. For datasets with multiple input paths (like Site0), use semicolons to separate paths within a dataset entry, and commas to separate different datasets (e.g., `path1,path2,"path3;path4",path5`).
*   `--site_ids`: Comma-separated site IDs corresponding to each dataset path provided in `--dataset_paths`.
*   `--method`: The name of the harmonization method to be used. Available methods are: `neuroharmonize`, `covbat`, `neurocombat`, `nestedcombat`, `comscanneuroharmonize`, `autocombat`, `relief`, `combat++`.
*   `[harmonizer_specific_options]`: Placeholders for parameters specific to each harmonization method. These are detailed below for each harmonizer.
*   `[dataset_options]`: Options related to dataset loading and preprocessing, such as `--patient_identifier`, `--features_to_drop`, `--features_to_map`, `--decade`, and `--icv`. These options are common across all harmonizers.

### Harmonization Methods and Example Commands

Below are example commands for each harmonization method. Adjust dataset paths and parameters as needed for your data.

**NeuroHarmonize:**
```bash
python harmonizer_cli.py --dataset_paths "../data/Site001_input.csv','../data/Site002_input.csv", ../data/Site1_input.csv,../data/Site2_input.csv,../data/Site3_input.csv,../data/Site4_input.csv --site_ids 0,1,2,3,4 --method neuroharmonize --patient_identifier participant_id --features_to_drop m0,id --features_to_map readout,labelling,sex --decade True --icv True --nh_features_to_harmonize aca_b_cov,mca_b_cov,pca_b_cov,totalgm_b_cov,aca_b_cbf,mca_b_cbf,pca_b_cbf,totalgm_b_cbf --nh_covariates age,sex,icv,site --nh_site_indicator site
```

**Covbat:**
```bash
python harmonizer_cli.py --dataset_paths "../data/Site001_input.csv','../data/Site002_input.csv", ../data/Site1_input.csv,../data/Site2_input.csv,../data/Site3_input.csv,../data/Site4_input.csv --site_ids 0,1,2,3,4 --method covbat --patient_identifier participant_id --features_to_drop m0,id --features_to_map readout,labelling,sex --decade True --icv True --cb_features_to_harmonize participant_id,site,age,sex,site,aca_b_cov,mca_b_cov,pca_b_cov,totalgm_b_cov,aca_b_cbf,mca_b_cbf,pca_b_cbf,totalgm_b_cbf --cb_covariates age,sex --cb_numerical_covariates age --cb_site_indicator site

### Important Notes

*   **Adjust Paths:** Ensure that you replace placeholder paths (e.g., `../data/Site1_input.csv`) with the actual paths to your data files.
*   **Parameter Tuning:** The provided commands use example parameters. You may need to adjust harmonization parameters (features to harmonize, covariates, etc.) based on your dataset and harmonization goals. Consult the documentation or code comments for each harmonizer to understand specific parameter options.
*   **R Requirement:** Methods like `RELIEF` and `Combat++` require R to be installed and accessible in your environment, along with the necessary R packages (`denoiseR`, `RcppCNPy`, `matrixStats`).
*   **Output Files:** Harmonized datasets will be saved as new CSV files in the same directory as your input datasets, with filenames appended with `output_<harmonization_method>`.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively utilize the harmonization functionalities within `cvasl` to process your MRI datasets and mitigate site-related biases.

## Harmonization Guide

This section provides a guide on using the `cvasl` library for MRI data harmonization. It covers the `MRIdataset` class for data loading and preprocessing, and various harmonization methods available in the `cvasl.harmonizers` module.

### MRIdataset Class

The `MRIdataset` class in `cvasl.dataset` is designed to handle MRI datasets from different sites, preparing them for harmonization and analysis.

**Initialization Parameters:**

*   `path` (str or list): Path to the CSV file or a list of paths. For multiple paths, use a list of strings.
*   `site_id` (int or str): Identifier for the data acquisition site.
*   `patient_identifier` (str, optional): Column name for patient IDs. Defaults to `"participant_id"`.
*   `cat_features_to_encode` (list, optional): List of categorical features to encode. Defaults to `None`.
*   `ICV` (bool, optional): Whether to add Intracranial Volume (ICV) related features. Defaults to `False`.
*   `decade` (bool, optional): Whether to add decade-related features based on age. Defaults to `False`.
*   `features_to_drop` (list, optional): List of features to drop during preprocessing. Defaults to `["m0", "id"]`.
*   `features_to_bin` (list, optional): List of features to bin. Defaults to `None`.
*   `binning_method` (str, optional): Binning method to use; `"equal_width"` or `"equal_frequency"`. Defaults to `"equal_width"`.
*   `num_bins` (int, optional): Number of bins for binning. Defaults to `10`.
*   `bin_labels` (list, optional): Labels for bins. Defaults to `None`.

**Usage Example:**

```python
from cvasl.dataset import MRIdataset

Site1 = MRIdataset(path='../data/Site1_input.csv', site_id=0, decade=True, ICV=True, patient_identifier='participant_id', features_to_drop=["m0", "id"])
Site2 = MRIdataset(path='../data/Site2_input.csv', site_id=1, decade=True, ICV=True, patient_identifier='participant_id', features_to_drop=["m0", "id"])
Site0 = MRIdataset(path=['../data/Site001_input.csv','../data/Site002_input.csv'], site_id=3, decade=True, ICV=True, patient_identifier='participant_id', features_to_drop=["m0", "id"])
```

**Preprocessing:**

After initializing `MRIdataset` objects, you can preprocess them using the `preprocess()` method:

```python
datasets = [Site1, Site2, Site0] # Example list of MRIdataset objects
[_d.preprocess() for _d in datasets]
```

**Categorical Feature Encoding:**

For categorical feature encoding across datasets, use the `encode_cat_features` function:

```python
from cvasl.dataset import encode_cat_features

features_to_map = ['readout', 'labelling', 'sex']
datasets = encode_cat_features(datasets, features_to_map)
```

### Harmonization Methods

The `cvasl.harmonizers` module provides several state-of-the-art harmonization methods. Below is a guide to each method and how to run them using the command-line interface (CLI).

**Running Harmonization via CLI:**

The `harmonizer_cli.py` script in `cvasl` allows you to run various harmonization methods from the command line. You need to specify the dataset paths, site IDs, harmonization method, and method-specific parameters.

**General CLI Usage:**

```bash
python harmonizer_cli.py --dataset_paths <dataset_path1>,<dataset_path2>,... --site_ids <site_id1>,<site_id2>,... --method <harmonization_method> [method_specific_options]
```
