def luma_video_generation_guide() -> str:
    """Guide for choosing the right Luma tool for video generation."""
    return """# Luma Video Generation Guide

When the user wants to generate video, choose the appropriate tool based on their needs:

## Text to Video (Simple)
**Tool:** `luma_generate_video`
**Use when:**
- User gives a text description: "make me a video of a cat"
- User wants Luma to handle the visuals from scratch
- Quick, prompt-based video creation

**Example:** "Create a video of astronauts in space"
-> Call `luma_generate_video` with prompt="Astronauts floating in space, stars in background, cinematic"

## Image to Video (Reference Images)
**Tool:** `luma_generate_video_from_image`
**Use when:**
- User provides an image URL to animate
- User wants video to start/end with a specific image
- User needs precise visual control

**Example:** "Animate this image: [image_url]"
-> Call `luma_generate_video_from_image` with start_image_url=image_url and appropriate prompt

## Extending Videos
**Tool:** `luma_extend_video` or `luma_extend_video_from_url`
**Use when:**
- User wants to make a video longer
- User wants to continue the motion from an existing video
- Building longer content piece by piece

**Example:** "Continue this video with more action"
-> Call `luma_extend_video` with video_id and new prompt

## Checking Status
**Tool:** `luma_get_task`
**Use when:**
- Generation takes time and user wants to check if it's ready
- User asks "is my video done?"

## Important Notes:
1. Video generation is async - always return the task_id to the user
2. Generation typically takes 1-2 minutes
3. Default aspect ratio is 16:9 (landscape)
4. Use 9:16 for mobile/vertical content
5. Enable loop=true for seamless looping videos
6. Enable enhancement=true for better clarity

@mcp.prompt()
def luma_workflow_examples() -> str:
    """Common workflow examples for Luma video generation."""
    return """# Luma Workflow Examples

## Workflow 1: Quick Video Generation
1. User: "Make me a video of waves on a beach"
2. Call `luma_generate_video(prompt="Ocean waves gently crashing on a sandy beach, sunset, peaceful")`
3. Return task_id to user
4. User can check status with `luma_get_task(task_id)`

## Workflow 2: Animate an Image
1. User provides image URL
2. Call `luma_generate_video_from_image(prompt="Camera slowly zooming in, gentle movement", start_image_url=user_url)`
3. Return task_id

## Workflow 3: Create Transition Between Two Images
1. User provides two image URLs
2. Call `luma_generate_video_from_image(start_image_url=first_url, end_image_url=second_url, prompt="Smooth morphing transition")`
3. Return task_id

## Workflow 4: Creating a Longer Video
1. Generate initial video with `luma_generate_video`
2. Get the video_id from the result
3. Call `luma_extend_video(video_id=video_id, prompt="Continue the motion...")`
4. Repeat step 3 as needed for longer content

## Workflow 5: Mobile-First Content
1. User wants content for TikTok/Instagram Reels
2. Call `luma_generate_video(prompt="...", aspect_ratio="9:16")`
3. Return task_id

## Tips:
- Always be descriptive in prompts - include motion, style, mood
- Mention camera movements: "zooming in", "panning left", "tracking shot"
- Specify style: "cinematic", "realistic", "dreamy", "dramatic"
- For looping content (GIFs, backgrounds), use loop=true

## Effective Prompt Elements

Good prompts include:
- **Subject:** What is the main focus? (person, animal, object, scene)
- **Motion:** What movement happens? (walking, flying, zooming, panning)
- **Style:** What's the visual style? (cinematic, realistic, artistic, anime)
- **Mood:** What's the atmosphere? (peaceful, dramatic, mysterious, joyful)
- **Setting:** Where does it take place? (beach, city, forest, space)
- **Lighting:** What's the light like? (sunset, golden hour, neon, dramatic)

## Example Prompts by Category

**Nature:**
"Ocean waves crashing on rocky cliffs at sunset, dramatic lighting, cinematic, slow motion"

**Animals:**
"A majestic lion walking through the savanna, golden hour lighting, documentary style"

**Urban:**
"Busy city street at night, neon lights reflecting on wet pavement, cyberpunk aesthetic"

**Space:**
"Astronauts floating in zero gravity inside a space station, Earth visible through window"

**Fantasy:**
"A magical forest with glowing fireflies, mist rising from the ground, ethereal atmosphere"

**Action:**
"Sports car racing through mountain roads, tracking shot, cinematic, fast motion"

## Motion Keywords

Camera movements:
- "zooming in/out" - Changes focal distance
- "panning left/right" - Horizontal camera rotation
- "tilting up/down" - Vertical camera rotation
- "tracking shot" - Camera follows subject
- "dolly shot" - Camera moves toward/away from subject
- "aerial view" - Bird's eye perspective

Subject movements:
- "walking", "running", "flying", "swimming"
- "dancing", "jumping", "falling", "rising"
- "morphing", "transforming", "dissolving"

## Style Keywords

- **Cinematic:** Movie-like quality, widescreen feel
- **Realistic:** Photo-realistic, natural
- **Artistic:** Stylized, creative interpretation
- **Anime:** Japanese animation style
- **Dreamy:** Soft, ethereal, surreal
- **Dramatic:** High contrast, intense
- **Documentary:** Natural, observational

## Tips for Better Results

1. Be specific about motion - don't just say "a cat", say "a cat slowly walking"
2. Include camera movement for dynamic videos
3. Mention lighting conditions for mood
4. Keep prompts focused - one main action per video
5. Use aspect ratio appropriate for content (16:9 landscape, 9:16 vertical)
