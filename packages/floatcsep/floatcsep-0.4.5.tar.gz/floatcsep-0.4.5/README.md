* Set up a testing **experiment** for your earthquake forecasts using authoritative data sources
  and benchmarks.
* **Encapsulate** the complete experiment's definition and rules in a couple of lines.
* **Reproduce**, **reuse**, and **share** forecasting experiments from you, other researchers
  and institutions.

# Installing floatCSEP

The core of `floatCSEP` is built around the `pyCSEP`
package (https://github.com/sceccode/pycsep), which itself contains the core dependencies.

## Latest version

Clone and install the floatCSEP source code using `pip`

```
conda create -n $NAME -y python=3.12
conda activate $NAME
git clone https://github.com/cseptesting/floatcsep
cd floatcsep
pip install -e .
```

## Stable Release

The simplest way to install `floatCSEP` is by creating a `conda`
environment (https://conda.io - checkout Anaconda or Miniforge) and install `floatCSEP`
from `conda-forge`

```
conda create -n $NAME -y python=3.12
conda activate $NAME
conda install -c conda-forge floatcsep -y
```

Please read
the [Installation](https://floatcsep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro/installation.html)
documentation for detailed instructions and additional installation methods.

# Run an Experiment

Using the command terminal, navigate to any tutorial experiment in ``floatcsep/tutorials/`` and
type

```
floatcsep run config.yml
```

A runtime directory will be created in a `results` folder. The experiment results can be
visualized in `results/report.md`, `results/report.pdf` or in a dashboard with:

```
floatcsep view config.yml
```

**Check out the experiment, models and tests definition in the tutorials [documentation](https://floatcsep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/case_a.html)** or in the configuration files for each case in ``floatcsep/tutorials/``.

# Roadmap and Known Issues

* Create tool to check a TD model's interface with ``floatcsep``
* Define a dependency strategy to ensure experiments' reproducibility (e.g., storing docker image).
* Implement spatial database and HDF5 experiment storage feature
* Set up task parallelization
* Document the process of an experiment deployment
