Welcome to Fandango!
Fandango is a _generator_ of inputs and interactions for software testing.
Given the specification of a program's input or interaction language, Fandango quickly generates myriads of valid sample inputs for testing.

The specification language combines a _grammar_ with _constraints_ written in Python, so it is extremely expressive and flexible.
Most notably, you can define your own _testing goals_ in Fandango.
If you need the inputs to have particular values or distributions, you can express all these right away in Fandango.

Fandango supports multiple modes of operation:

* By default, Fandango operates as a _black-box_ fuzzer - that is, it creates inputs from a `.fan` Fandango specification file.
* If you have _sample inputs_, Fandango can _mutate_ these to obtain more realistic inputs.
* Fandango can also produce _interactions_ for _protocol fuzzing_ - that is, it acts as a client or server producing and reacting to interactions according to specification.

Fandango comes as a portable Python program and can easily be run on a large variety of platforms.

Under the hood, Fandango uses sophisticated _evolutionary algorithms_ to produce inputs,
it starts with a population of random inputs, and evolves these through mutations and cross-over until they fulfill the given constraints.

Fandango is in active development! Features planned for 2026 include:

* coverage-guided testing
* code-directed testing
* high diversity inputs

and many more.
