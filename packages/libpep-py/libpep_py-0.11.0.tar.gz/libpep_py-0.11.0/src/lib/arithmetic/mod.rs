//! Implementation of arithmetic operations on Curve25519 with Ristretto, using the
//! `curve25519-dalek` library.
//!
//! We use the [`signalapp/curve25519-dalek`](https://github.com/signalapp/curve25519-dalek)
//! fork of the well-known [`curve25519-dalek`](https://crates.io/crates/curve25519-dalek)
//! crate (which we published as [`curve25519-dalek-libpep`](https://crates.io/crates/curve25519-dalek-libpep)),
//! to use lizard encoding and decoding for [`GroupElement`](group_elements::GroupElement)s.
//!
//! Scalars can be converted into [`GroupElement`](group_elements::GroupElement)s by multiplying them with the base point [`G`](group_elements::G).
//!
//! We define two types of scalars: [`ScalarNonZero`](scalars::ScalarNonZero) and [`ScalarCanBeZero`](scalars::ScalarCanBeZero) to nicely handle edge
//! cases in the rest of the code where a zero scalar is not allowed.
//! Moreover, we overload the arithmetic operators for addition, subtraction, and multiplication,
//! so that the code is more readable and easier to understand, so it matches the notation in the
//! mathematical papers.
