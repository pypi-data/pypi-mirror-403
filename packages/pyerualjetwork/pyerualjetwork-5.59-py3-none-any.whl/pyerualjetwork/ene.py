   """
   Initializes a population of genomes, where each genome is represented by a set of weights 
   and an associated activation function. Each genome is created with random weights and activation 
   functions are applied and normalized. (Max abs normalization.)

   Args:

      input_shape (int): The number of input features for the neural network.

      population_size (int): The number of genomes (individuals) in the population.

      neurons (list[int], optional): If you dont want train PLAN model this parameter represents neuron count of each hidden layer for MLP. Default: [] (PLAN)

      activation_functions (list[str], optional): If you dont want train PLAN model this parameter represents activation function of each hidden layer for MLP. Default: [] (PLAN) NOTE: THIS EFFECTS HIDDEN LAYERS OUTPUT. NOT OUTPUT LAYER!

      dtype (numpy.dtype): Data type for the arrays. np.float32 by default. Example: np.float64 or np.float16.

   Notes:
      The weights are initialized randomly within the range [-1, 1]. 
      Activation functions are selected randomly from a predefined list `all_activations()`.
      The weights for each genome are then modified by applying the corresponding activation function 
      and normalized using the `normalization()` function. (Max abs normalization.)

   """
   Applies the evolving process of a population of genomes using selection, crossover, mutation, and activation function potentiation.
   The function modifies the population's weights and activation functions based on a specified policy, mutation probabilities, and strategy.

   'selection' args effects cross-over.
   'mutate' args effects mutation.

   Args:
      weights (numpy.ndarray): Array of weights for each genome. 
         (first returned value of define_genomes function)
      
      activations (list[str]): A list of activation functions for each genome. 
         (second returned value of define_genomes function) NOTE!: 'activation potentiations' for PLAN 'activation functions' for MLP.
      
      what_gen (int): The current generation number, used for informational purposes or logging.
      
      fitness (numpy.ndarray): A 1D array containing the fitness values of each genome. 
         The array is used to rank the genomes based on their performance. ENE maximizes or minimizes this fitness based on the `target_fitness` parameter.
      
      weight_evolve (bool, optional): Are weights to be evolves or just activation combinations Default: True. Note: Regardless of whether this parameter is True or False, you must give the evolver function a list of weights equal to the number of activation potentiations. You can create completely random weights if you want. If this parameter is False, the weights entering the evolver function and the resulting weights will be exactly the same.
      
      show_info (bool, optional): If True, prints information about the current generation and the 
         maximum reward obtained. Also shows the current configuration. Default is False.
      
      strategy (str, optional): The strategy for combining the best and bad genomes. Options:
         - 'normal_selective': Normal selection based on fitness, where a portion of the bad genes are discarded.
         - 'more_selective': A more selective strategy, where fewer bad genes survive.
         - 'less_selective': A less selective strategy, where more bad genes survive.
         Default is 'more_selective'.
      
      bar_status (bool, optional): Loading bar status during evolving process of genomes. True or False. Default: True

      policy (str, optional): The selection policy that governs how genomes are selected for reproduction. Options:
            
            - 'aggressive': Aggressive policy using very aggressive selection policy. 
                  Advantages: fast training. 
                  Disadvantages: may lead to fitness stuck in a local maximum or minimum.

            - 'explorer': Explorer policy increases population diversity.
                  Advantages: fitness does not get stuck at local maximum or minimum.
                  Disadvantages: slow training.
                  
                  Suggestions: Use hybrid and dynamic policy. When fitness appears stuck, switch to the 'explorer' policy.

            Default: 'aggressive'.
      
      fitness_bias (float, optional): Fitness bias must be a probability value between 0 and 1 that determines the effect of fitness on the crossover process. Default: 1.
      
      bad_genomes_mutation_prob (float, optional): The probability of applying mutation to the bad genomes. 
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Also affects the mutation probability of the best genomes inversely. 
         For example, a value of 0.7 for bad genomes implies 0.3 for best genomes. Default: Determined by `policy`.
      
      bad_genomes_selection_prob (float, optional): The probability of crossover parents are bad genomes ? [0-1] Default: Determined by `policy`.

      activation_mutate_prob (float, optional): The probability of applying mutation to the activation functions. 
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.5 (%50).
      
      cross_over_mode (str, optional): Specifies the crossover method to use. Options:
         - 'tpm': Two-Point Matrix Crossover.
         Default is 'tpm'.
      
      activation_mutate_add_prob (float, optional): The probability of adding a new activation function to the genome for mutation. 
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.5.
      
      activation_mutate_delete_prob (float, optional): The probability of deleting an existing activation function 
         from the genome for mutation. Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.5.
      
      activation_mutate_change_prob (float, optional): The probability of changing an activation function in the genome for mutation. 
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.5.
      
      weight_mutate_prob (float, optional): The probability of mutating a weight in the genome. 
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 1 (%100).
      
      weight_mutate_threshold (int): Determines max how much weight mutaiton operation applying. (Function automaticly determines to min) Default: 16

      activation_selection_add_prob (float, optional): The probability of adding an existing activation function for crossover.
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.5. (WARNING! Higher values increase complexity. For faster training, increase this value.)
      
      activation_selection_change_prob (float, optional): The probability of changing an activation function in the genome for crossover. 
         Must be in the range [0, 1]. Default is 0.5.
      
      activation_mutate_threshold (int, optional): Determines max how much activation mutaiton operation applying. (Function automaticly determines to min) Default: 20
      
      activation_selection_threshold (int, optional): Determines max how much activaton transferable to child from undominant parent. (Function automaticly determines to min) Default: 20

      is_mlp (bool, optional): Evolve PLAN model or MLP model ? Default: False (PLAN)
      
      save_best_genome (bool, optional): Save the best genome of the previous generation to the next generation. (index of best individual: 0) Default: True

      dtype (numpy.dtype, optional): Data type for the arrays. Default: np.float32. 
         Example: np.float64 or np.float16 [fp32 for balanced devices, fp64 for strong devices, fp16 for weak devices: not recommended!].

   Raises:
      ValueError: 
         - If `policy` is not one of the specified values ('aggressive', 'explorer').
         - If 'strategy' is not one of the specified values ('less_selective', 'normal_selective', 'more_selective')
         - If `cross_over_mode` is not one of the specified values ('tpm').
         - If `bad_genomes_mutation_prob`, `activation_mutate_prob`, or other probability parameters are not in the range 0 and 1.
         - If the population size is odd (ensuring an even number of genomes is required for proper selection).
         - If 'fitness_bias' value is not in range 0 and 1.

   Returns:
      tuple: A tuple containing:
         - weights (numpy.ndarray): The updated weights for the population after selection, crossover, and mutation. 
                                    The shape is (population_size, output_shape, input_shape).
         - activations (list): The updated list of activation functions for the population.

   Notes:
      - **Selection Process**: 
         - The genomes are sorted by their fitness (based on `fitness`), and then split into "best" and "bad" halves. 
         - The best genomes are retained, and the bad genomes are modified based on the selected strategy.
         
      - **Crossover Strategies**:
         - The **'cross_over'** strategy performs crossover, where parts of the best genomes' weights are combined with other good genomes to create new weight matrices.
         
      - **Mutation**:
         - Mutation is applied to both the best and bad genomes, depending on the mutation probability and the `policy`.
         - `bad_genomes_mutation_prob` determines the probability of applying mutations to the bad genomes.
         - If `activation_mutate_prob` is provided, activation function mutations are applied to the genomes based on this probability.
         
      - **Population Size**: The population size must be an even number to properly split the best and bad genomes. If `fitness` has an odd length, an error is raised.
      
      - **Logging**: If `show_info=True`, the current generation and the maximum reward from the population are printed for tracking the learning progress.

   Example:
      ```python
      weights, activations = ene_cpu.evolver(weights, activations, 1, fitness, show_info=True, strategy='normal_selective', policy='aggressive')
      ```

      - The function returns the updated weights and activations after processing based on the chosen strategy, policy, and mutation parameters.

              or replaced based on their respective probabilities (`activation_add_prob`, `activation_delete_prob`, 
              `activation_change_prob`).

          the optimization process.
