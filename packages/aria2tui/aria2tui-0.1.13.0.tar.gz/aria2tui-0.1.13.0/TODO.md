> [!Bug] Bugs
> - [ ] Fix order upon refresh
>   - [ ] when the item order refreshes (e.g. new downloads added) the selected items change. need to associate the selected items with gids and then create new selected items which will be passed back
> - [ ] (!!!) Fix cursor position upon refresh
>   - [ ] takes us back to the top when it refreshes in a different mode (I think due to filter)
>   - [ ] add pin_cursor option to pqrevent the cursor from going down when refreshing
>   - [ ] might have to do with filtering; 
>   - [ ] when original sort order there is no jumping
>   - [ ] lots of jumping when sorting by size
> - [ ] Filter/search problems
>   - [ ] ^[^\s] matches all rows in help but only highlights the first col
>     - [ ] seems to match the expression in any col but then only show highlights based on the row_str so misses matches in the second col
>  - [ ] restrict refresh so that it doesn't exit on the menu
>  - [x] infobox causes flickering
>   - [x] Caused by stdscr.clear() which we called when creating the new Picker(). We need to use stdscr.erase().

> - [x] Opening Files:
>   - [ ] When we try to open a download that has been moved it prints 'xdg-mimetype argument missing'. 
>    - Check for file existence, if it doesn't exist then suppress stderr and show a notification.
