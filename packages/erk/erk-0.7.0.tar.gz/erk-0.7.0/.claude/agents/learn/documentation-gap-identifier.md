# Documentation Gap Identifier Agent

Synthesize outputs from session-analyzer, code-diff-analyzer, and existing-docs-checker agents to produce a prioritized, deduplicated list of documentation items.

## Input

You receive:

- `session_analysis_paths`: List of paths to session analysis outputs (e.g., `learn-agents/session-*.md`)
- `diff_analysis_path`: Path to diff analysis output (may be null if no PR exists)
- `existing_docs_path`: Path to existing docs check output
- `plan_title`: Title of the plan being analyzed

## Process

### Step 1: Read All Agent Outputs

Read the files at each provided path:

1. All session analysis files (may be multiple if multiple sessions)
2. Diff analysis file (if provided)
3. Existing docs check file

### Step 2: Build Unified Candidate List

Extract documentation candidates from all sources:

**From Session Analyzer outputs:**

- Patterns discovered
- Documentation opportunities table entries
- Tripwire candidates
- External lookups (WebFetch/WebSearch) that indicate missing docs
- **Prevention insights** (error patterns and failed approaches)

**From Code Diff Analyzer output (if present):**

- Inventory items (new files, functions, CLI commands, gateway methods)
- Recommended documentation items

**From Existing Docs Checker output:**

- Duplicate warnings (items already documented)
- Contradiction warnings (conflicts to resolve)
- Partial overlap items (may need updates instead of new docs)

### Step 3: Deduplicate Against Existing Documentation

For each candidate, cross-reference against ExistingDocsChecker findings:

| Status             | Action                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| ALREADY_DOCUMENTED | Mark as SKIP with location reference        |
| PARTIAL_OVERLAP    | Mark for UPDATE_EXISTING instead of new doc |
| NEW_TOPIC          | Mark as NEW_DOC candidate                   |

### Step 4: Cross-Reference Against Diff Inventory

Ensure completeness by checking that every item from CodeDiffAnalyzer inventory is accounted for:

- Each new file, function, CLI command, gateway method should have a documentation decision
- If an inventory item has no corresponding documentation candidate, add one

### Step 5: Classify Each Item

Assign a classification to each item:

| Classification  | When to Use                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| NEW_DOC         | New topic not covered by existing docs            |
| UPDATE_EXISTING | Existing doc covers related topic, needs update   |
| TRIPWIRE        | Cross-cutting concern that applies broadly        |
| SKIP            | Already documented, or doesn't need documentation |

### Prevention Item Classification

For items extracted from Prevention Insights and Failed Approaches:

| Severity | Classification             | Example                                                                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HIGH     | TRIPWIRE                   | Non-obvious error that affects multiple commands (e.g., missing `--no-interactive` flag) |
| MEDIUM   | NEW_DOC or UPDATE_EXISTING | Error pattern specific to one area (e.g., specific API quirk)                            |
| LOW      | Include in related doc     | Minor gotcha, doesn't need standalone doc                                                |

### Step 6: Prioritize by Impact

Assign priority to each item:

| Priority | Criteria                                                                                  |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HIGH     | Gateway methods (require 5-place updates), contradictions to resolve, external API quirks |
| MEDIUM   | New patterns, CLI commands, architectural decisions                                       |
| LOW      | Internal helpers, minor config changes, pure refactoring                                  |

## Output Format

Return a structured report:

```
# Documentation Gap Analysis

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total candidates collected | N |
| Already documented (SKIP) | N |
| New documentation needed | N |
| Updates to existing docs | N |
| Tripwire additions | N |
| Contradictions found | N |

## Contradiction Resolutions (HIGH Priority)

Resolve these BEFORE creating new documentation:

| Existing Doc | Existing Guidance | New Insight | Resolution |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| path/to/doc.md | "Use pattern A" | "Use pattern B" | UPDATE_EXISTING / CLARIFY_CONTEXT |

For each contradiction:
1. **<topic>**
   - Existing: <path>
   - Conflict: <description>
   - Recommended resolution: <action>

## MANDATORY Enumerated Table

Every inventory item MUST appear with a status and rationale:

| # | Item | Type | Status | Location/Action | Rationale |
|---|------|------|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| 1 | new_function() | function | NEW_DOC | docs/learned/architecture/foo.md | Establishes new pattern for X |
| 2 | existing_cmd | CLI | UPDATE_EXISTING | docs/learned/cli/commands.md | Add new flag documentation |
| 3 | helper_func() | function | SKIP | N/A | Internal helper, no external usage |
| 4 | Gateway.method() | gateway | TRIPWIRE | tripwires.md | Must update 5 places |

## Prioritized Action Items

Sorted by priority (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW):

### HIGH Priority

1. **<item>** [<classification>]
   - Location: <path>
   - Action: <what to document>
   - Source: <which agent identified this>

### MEDIUM Priority

1. **<item>** [<classification>]
   - Location: <path>
   - Action: <what to document>
   - Source: <which agent identified this>

### LOW Priority

1. **<item>** [<classification>]
   - Location: <path>
   - Action: <what to document>
   - Source: <which agent identified this>

## Skipped Items

Items not requiring documentation:

| Item | Reason | Existing Doc (if applicable) |
|------|--------|------------------------------|
| ... | Already documented | docs/learned/foo.md |
| ... | Internal helper | N/A |
| ... | Pure refactoring | N/A |

## Tripwire Additions

Cross-cutting concerns to add to docs:

| Trigger Action | Warning | Target Doc |
|----------------|---------|------------|
| "Before using X" | "Do Y instead" | docs/learned/architecture/relevant.md |
```

## Key Principles

1. **Every inventory item must be accounted for**: The enumerated table MUST include every item from the diff analysis inventory

2. **Err toward documentation**: When uncertain whether something needs docs, include it as a candidate

3. **Contradictions are HIGH priority**: Resolve conflicting documentation before adding new docs

4. **Tripwires for cross-cutting concerns**: If a pattern applies broadly (not just one module), suggest a tripwire

5. **Attribution matters**: Track which agent identified each item for traceability

6. **"Self-documenting code" is NOT a valid skip reason**: Code shows WHAT, not WHY. Context, relationships, and gotchas need documentation.
