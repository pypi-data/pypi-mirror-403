description: Replan all open erk-learn plans via consolidation workflow
---

# /local:replan-learn-plans

Queries all open erk-learn plan issues and passes them to `/erk:replan` for consolidation into a single unified documentation plan.

## Rationale

- Learn plans often overlap (multiple sessions may discover similar documentation opportunities)
- One unified documentation plan is cleaner to implement than N separate ones
- Replan consolidation identifies overlap and deduplication opportunities

## Usage

```bash
/local:replan-learn-plans
```

---

## Agent Instructions

### Step 1: Query Open erk-learn Issues

Fetch all open issues with the `erk-learn` label:

```bash
gh api repos/dagster-io/erk/issues \
  -X GET \
  --paginate \
  -f labels=erk-learn \
  -f state=open \
  -f per_page=100 \
  --jq '.[] | {number, title, created_at}'
```

Note: Uses REST API (not `gh issue list`) to avoid GraphQL rate limits.

Store the results as a list of issues with their numbers and titles.

### Step 2: Handle Edge Cases

Based on the number of issues found:

#### 2a: Zero Issues

If no open erk-learn issues found:

```
No open erk-learn plans found. Nothing to replan.
```

Stop here.

#### 2b: One Issue

If exactly one issue found, present it and ask the user:

```
Found 1 open erk-learn plan:

| Issue | Title | Created |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |
| #<number> | <title> | <date> |

This single plan can be replanned to update it against the current codebase.
```

Use AskUserQuestion with options:

- "Replan this issue" - Proceed with single replan
- "Cancel" - Exit without action

If user cancels, stop here.

#### 2c: Multiple Issues

If 2+ issues found, present the list:

```
Found <N> open erk-learn plans:

| Issue | Title | Created |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |
| #<number1> | <title1> | <date1> |
| #<number2> | <title2> | <date2> |
...

These plans will be consolidated into a single unified documentation plan.
```

Use AskUserQuestion with options:

- "Consolidate all plans" - Proceed with consolidation
- "Cancel" - Exit without action

If user cancels, stop here.

### Step 3: Invoke /erk:replan

Build the issue list and invoke the replan skill:

**For single issue:**

```
/erk:replan <issue_number>
```

**For multiple issues:**

```
/erk:replan <issue1> <issue2> <issue3> ...
```

Use the Skill tool with `skill: "erk:replan"` and `args: "<space-separated issue numbers>"`.
