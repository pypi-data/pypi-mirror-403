"""Generate PR summary from PR diff.

This exec command generates a PR summary by analyzing the PR diff
using Claude. It uses the same prompt as commit message generation but
does NOT include commit messages (which may contain misleading info
about .worker-impl/ deletions).

This is used by the GitHub Actions workflow when updating PR bodies
after implementation.

Usage:
    erk exec generate-pr-summary --pr-number 123

Output:
    PR summary text (title on first line, body follows)

Exit Codes:
    0: Success
    1: Error (missing pr-number, no diff, Claude failure)

Examples:
    $ erk exec generate-pr-summary --pr-number 1895
