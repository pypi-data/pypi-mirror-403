"""Checkout navigation helpers - shared across checkout commands.

This module is separate from navigation_helpers.py to avoid circular imports.
navigation_helpers imports from wt.create_cmd, which triggers wt/__init__.py,
which imports wt.checkout_cmd. By having checkout-specific helpers here,
we break that cycle.
