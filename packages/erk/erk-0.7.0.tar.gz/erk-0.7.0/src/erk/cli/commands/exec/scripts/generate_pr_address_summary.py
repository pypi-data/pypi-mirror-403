"""Generate enhanced PR comment for pr-address workflow.

This exec command generates a detailed PR comment summarizing changes made
by the pr-address workflow. It reads a diff from stdin and uses Claude to
generate a human-readable summary.

Usage:
    git diff $PRE_HEAD..HEAD | erk exec generate-pr-address-summary \
        --pr-number 123 \
        --pre-head abc1234 \
        --model-name claude-sonnet-4-5 \
        --run-url https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/789 \
        --job-status success

Output:
    Complete markdown comment body (including marker for idempotent updates)

Exit Codes:
    0: Success
    1: Error (Claude failure, invalid job status)

Examples:
    # Success with changes
    $ echo "+added line" | erk exec generate-pr-address-summary \
        --pr-number 123 --pre-head abc --run-url URL --job-status success
    <!-- erk:pr-address-run -->
    ## PR Review Comments Addressed
    ...

    # Success with no changes
    $ echo "" | erk exec generate-pr-address-summary \
        --pr-number 123 --pre-head abc --run-url URL --job-status success
    <!-- erk:pr-address-run -->
    ## PR Review Comments Addressed
    No changes were needed...
