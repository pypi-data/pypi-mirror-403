# GitHub Workflows

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows for the erk project.

## Required Secrets

### GitHub PAT: `ERK_QUEUE_GH_PAT`

A Personal Access Token (PAT) with the following permissions is required for workflows that push commits or trigger other workflows:

**Required permissions:**

- `contents: write` - Push commits to branches
- `workflows` - Trigger workflow_dispatch events
- `gist` - Create gists for session log storage

**Why GITHUB_TOKEN isn't sufficient:**

The built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` has two limitations that require using a PAT:

1. **Git push authentication**: When a workflow checks out code with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, git is not configured with credentials that allow pushing. Using a PAT at checkout time (`actions/checkout` with `token:`) configures git authentication so subsequent `git push` commands work.

2. **Cross-workflow triggers**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot trigger other workflows via `workflow_dispatch`. This is a GitHub security feature to prevent infinite workflow loops. A PAT is required for the `gh workflow run` command.

**Used in:**

- `learn-dispatch.yml` - Checkout (for push), dispatch to erk-impl
- `erk-impl.yml` - Checkout (for push)

## Repository Settings

The following repository settings are required:

**Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions:**

- Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

Without this setting, PR creation via `gh pr create` will fail with:
"GitHub Actions is not permitted to create or approve pull requests"
