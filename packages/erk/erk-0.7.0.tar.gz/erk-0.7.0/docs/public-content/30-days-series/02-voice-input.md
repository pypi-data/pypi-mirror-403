# Day Two: Use Voice Input

I've only recently started using voice input with Claude Code, and it feels like it shouldn't be that big of a deal. But it's been pretty transformational in my relationship with these tools.

I use a program called [Wispr Flow](https://www.wispr.ai/). There are other options, but this one works well for me.

## Voice Input = Faster Token Throughput

The reason voice input makes such a difference is simple: you inevitably provide more context when you talk than when you type.

When you write or type, you have a lot of thoughts in your head, and you compress them into a more condensed format. It's just the nature of how typing works. Your bit rate—the rate at which you can produce tokens—is much higher when speaking.

What happens in practice, at least in my experience, when you talk instead of type is that you end up providing way more context than you would otherwise. You ramble. You talk about why something happened and when it happened. You provide background that would feel too verbose to type out. That's fine. In fact, it's desirable.

The models are remarkably good at distilling the meaningful context out of this. You can think of yourself as the raw materials for a token factory, which is your agentic tool. When you speak, you're providing more raw inputs, and you just have to trust that the LLM is good at identifying what's relevant. And in practice, it is.

## It Feels Weird at First

Talking to your computer feels a little strange when you start. You might feel self-conscious, especially if you're in a shared space.

But you get over it quickly. And the benefits are substantial enough that it's worth pushing through that initial awkwardness.

## TL;DR

Try using voice input with Claude Code. Tools like Wispr Flow make this easy. You'll naturally provide more context when speaking than typing, your bit rate is higher, and Claude is excellent at distilling meaningful information from conversational input. It feels weird at first, but I can't recommend it highly enough.
