### Key File Locations at a Glance

| Location               | Purpose                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.claude/plans/*.md` | Local plan storage (sorted by modification time)  |
| `.impl/plan.md`        | Immutable plan in worktree (local implementation) |
| `.impl/progress.md`    | Mutable progress tracking                         |
| `.impl/issue.json`     | GitHub issue reference                            |
| `.impl/run-info.json`  | GitHub Actions run reference (remote only)        |
| `.worker-impl/`        | Remote implementation folder (GitHub Actions)     |

### Which Phase Am I In?

| Observable State                        | Current Phase                |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Issue has `erk-plan` label, no comments | Phase 1: Created             |
| Issue has `submission-queued` comment   | Phase 2: Submitted           |
| Issue has `workflow-started` comment    | Phase 3: Dispatched          |
| PR is draft, workflow running           | Phase 4: Implementing        |
| PR is ready for review                  | Phase 5: Complete            |
| Issue is CLOSED                         | Merged (PR closed the issue) |

### Plan Relevance Assessment

When evaluating whether a plan should be implemented or closed, use the verdict classification system from `/local:check-relevance`:

| Verdict               | Overlap | Meaning                                            |
| --------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| SUPERSEDED            | >80%    | Work is already implemented in master              |
| PARTIALLY_IMPLEMENTED | 30-80%  | Some work exists, plan may need scoping adjustment |
| DIFFERENT_APPROACH    | N/A     | Same problem solved with different implementation  |
| STILL_RELEVANT        | <30%    | Work is not yet implemented, plan remains valid    |
| NEEDS_REVIEW          | Unclear | Manual review required, evidence inconclusive      |

**Usage:** Run `/local:check-relevance <plan-issue-number>` to assess a plan's current relevance before deciding to implement or close it.

---

## Phase 1: Plan Creation

Plans can be created through two paths: interactive (via Claude) or CLI (direct).

### Interactive Path: Plan Mode + `/erk:plan-save`

The interactive path uses Claude's plan mode for guided plan creation:

```bash
# 1. Enter Plan Mode (automatic for complex tasks)
# 2. Create plan interactively
# 3. Exit Plan Mode
# 4. Save to GitHub:
/erk:plan-save
```

This workflow:

1. Claude enters Plan Mode for the task
2. Plan creation with context extraction
3. Plan saved to `~/.claude/plans/*.md` on Exit Plan Mode
4. `/erk:plan-save` creates GitHub Issue with `erk-plan` label

### CLI Path: `erk plan create --file <path>`

Direct plan creation from a file:

```bash
erk plan create --file my-plan.md
```

This creates a GitHub Issue directly from the plan file.

### Plan Storage

Plans are stored in GitHub Issues:

- **Issue body**: Contains `plan-header` metadata block
- **First comment**: Contains `plan-body` with full plan content in collapsible details

**Issue body structure:**

````markdown
# Plan: [Title]

<!-- WARNING: Machine-generated. Manual edits may break erk tooling. -->
<!-- erk:metadata-block:plan-header -->
<details>
<summary><code>plan-header</code></summary>

```yaml
created_at: 2025-01-15T10:30:00Z
created_by: username
last_dispatched_at: null
last_dispatched_run_id: null
last_local_impl_at: null
```
````

</details>
<!-- /erk:metadata-block:plan-header -->
```

**First comment structure:**

```markdown
<!-- erk:metadata-block:plan-body -->
<details>
<summary><code>plan-body</code></summary>

[Full plan content here]

</details>
<!-- /erk:metadata-block:plan-body -->
```

### The `erk-plan` Label

The `erk-plan` label marks issues as implementation plans:

- **Auto-created** if it doesn't exist (green, #0E8A16)
- **Required** for submission and implementation
- **Validated** before workflow dispatch

---

## Phase 2: Plan Submission

Submission prepares the plan for remote execution via `erk plan submit <issue_number>`.

**Key responsibility**: `erk plan submit` is the **source of truth** for branch and PR creation. The workflow dispatch (Phase 3) expects these to already exist.

### Pre-Submission Validation

Before submission, the command validates:

1. **Label check**: Issue must have `erk-plan` label
2. **State check**: Issue must be OPEN (not closed)
3. **Clean working directory**: No uncommitted changes

### Branch Reuse Detection

Before creating a new branch, `erk plan submit` checks for existing local branches matching `P{issue_number}-*`:

```
Found existing local branch(es) for this issue:
  • P123-feature-01-10-0900
  • P123-feature-01-12-1430

New branch would be: P123-feature-01-15-1600

Use existing branch 'P123-feature-01-12-1430'? [Y/n]
```

**User options:**

1. **Use existing** (default): Continue with the most recent branch
2. **Delete and create new**: Remove existing branches, start fresh
3. **Abort**: Cancel submission

This prevents branch proliferation when resubmitting plans. See [Branch Reuse in Plan Submit](submit-branch-reuse.md) for details.

### Branch Creation

Branches are created directly via git:

```bash
git branch <branch_name> <base_branch>
```

**Branch naming**: Erk computes the branch name using `sanitize_worktree_name()` with a timestamp suffix. This ensures branch names match worktree naming conventions (31-char max + `-MM-DD-HHMM` suffix).

**Example**: Issue #123 "Add user authentication" → `123-add-user-authentic-11-30-1430`

### Learn Plan Base Branch Selection

Learn plans (issues with `erk-learn` label) use special base branch logic:

1. **Extract parent reference**: Read `learned_from_issue` from plan-header metadata
2. **Fetch parent plan**: Get the parent implementation plan's issue
3. **Get parent branch**: Extract `branch_name` from parent's plan-header
4. **Stack on parent**: Use parent's branch as base instead of trunk

This creates a branch hierarchy:

```
trunk (main)
    └── P123-feature-branch (parent implementation)
            └── P456-docs-for-feature (learn plan)
```

**Fallback**: If parent lookup fails (missing parent, no branch recorded), falls back to trunk.

**Implementation**: See `get_learn_plan_parent_branch()` in `src/erk/cli/commands/submit.py`.

### `.worker-impl/` Folder Creation

The submit command creates the `.worker-impl/` folder structure:

```
.worker-impl/
├── plan.md         # Full plan content from issue
├── progress.md     # Initial progress tracking (all unchecked)
├── issue.json      # GitHub issue reference
└── README.md       # Documentation for the folder
```

**`issue.json` structure:**

```json
{
  "issue_number": 123,
  "issue_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "synced_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Draft PR Creation

A draft PR is created locally (for correct commit attribution):

- **Title**: Issue title with "Plan: " prefix stripped
- **Body**: Includes checkout instructions and metadata
- **State**: Draft (marked ready after implementation)

**Note**: The PR body includes `**Plan:** #<issue_number>` to link back to the issue. Issue closing is handled via commit message keywords ("Closes #N") when the PR is merged.

### `distinct_id` Generation

A 6-character base36 identifier is generated for workflow run discovery:

- Used in workflow `run-name` for matching
- Enables polling to find the specific run
- Format: `{issue_number}:{distinct_id}` in run display title

### Metadata Update

After submission, the issue receives a `submission-queued` comment with metadata:

```yaml
schema: submission-queued
queued_at: 2025-01-15T10:30:00Z
submitted_by: username
issue_number: 123
validation_results:
  issue_is_open: true
  has_erk_plan_label: true
expected_workflow: erk-impl
```

---

## Phase 3: Workflow Dispatch

The `erk-impl.yml` workflow handles remote implementation.

### Workflow Inputs

| Input          | Description                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `issue_number` | GitHub issue number to implement     |
| `submitted_by` | GitHub username of submitter         |
| `distinct_id`  | 6-char base36 for run discovery      |
| `issue_title`  | Issue title for workflow run display |

### Concurrency Control

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: implement-issue-${{ github.event.inputs.issue_number }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

This ensures only one implementation runs per issue at a time.

### Workflow Phases

#### Phase 1: Checkout & Setup

- Checkout repository with full history
- Install tools: `uv`, `erk`, `claude`, `prettier`
- Configure git with submitter identity
- Detect trunk branch (main or master)

#### Phase 2: Find PR & Checkout Branch

- Find existing PR via `gh pr list --head <branch_name>` (by branch, not body search)
- Checkout the implementation branch
- Update `.worker-impl/` with fresh plan content (for reruns)

#### Phase 3: Use Existing PR

- Use existing PR (created by `erk plan submit`)
- Post `workflow-started` comment to issue
- Update issue body with `last_dispatched_run_id`

#### Phase 4: Implementation

- Copy `.worker-impl/` to `.impl/` (Claude reads `.impl/`)
- Create `.impl/run-info.json` with workflow run details
- Execute `/erk:plan-implement` with Claude

#### Phase 5: Submission

- Stage implementation changes (NOT `.worker-impl/` deletion)
- Run `/erk:git-pr-push` to create proper commit message
- Clean up `.worker-impl/` in separate commit
- Mark PR ready for review
- Update PR body with implementation summary
- Trigger CI via empty commit

---

## Phase 4: Implementation

Implementation executes the plan, whether locally or via GitHub Actions.

### `.worker-impl/` vs `.impl/`

| Folder          | Purpose                                      | Git Status                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `.worker-impl/` | Remote implementation (GitHub Actions)       | Committed, then deleted          |
| `.impl/`        | Local implementation + Claude's working copy | In `.gitignore`, never committed |

In GitHub Actions, `.worker-impl/` is copied to `.impl/` before Claude runs.

### `.impl/run-info.json`

Created in GitHub Actions to track the workflow run:

```json
{
  "run_id": "1234567890",
  "run_url": "https://github.com/owner/repo/actions/runs/1234567890"
}
```

### `/erk:plan-implement` Command

The implementation command:

1. Validates `.impl/` exists with `plan.md` and `progress.md`
2. Creates TodoWrite entries for tracking
3. Posts start comment to GitHub issue (if linked)
4. Executes each phase sequentially
5. Updates `progress.md` as steps complete
6. Runs CI validation
7. Cleans up artifacts

### Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked in `.impl/progress.md`:

```markdown
---
completed_steps: 3
total_steps: 5
steps:
  - text: "1. First step"
    completed: true
  - text: "2. Second step"
    completed: true
  - text: "3. Third step"
    completed: true
  - text: "4. Fourth step"
    completed: false
  - text: "5. Fifth step"
    completed: false
---

# Progress Tracking

- [x] 1. First step
- [x] 2. Second step
- [x] 3. Third step
- [ ] 4. Fourth step
- [ ] 5. Fifth step
```

Progress tracking is done via the TodoWrite tool in the Claude Code session.

### Detecting Queued vs Implemented Plans

A PR associated with a plan may exist but not contain the actual implementation:

- **Queued Plan**: PR contains only `.worker-impl/` folder with plan files
- **Implemented Plan**: PR contains actual source code changes

To verify implementation status:

1. Check if PR diff includes changes outside `.worker-impl/`
2. Use `gh pr diff <number>` and look for actual implementation files
3. Don't rely solely on PR state (OPEN/MERGED) - a PR can be open with only plan files

This pattern was discovered when verifying prerequisite PR #5577: the PR existed and was open, but only contained `.worker-impl/` plan files, not the actual PlanSynthesizer agent.

### No-Changes Error Scenario

When implementation produces no code changes (duplicate plan, work already merged), the workflow handles this gracefully:

1. **Detects no changes**: Branch has no commits beyond base
2. **Creates diagnostic PR**: Updates PR body with diagnostic information
3. **Applies `no-changes` label**: Marks PR for user review
4. **Posts issue comment**: Links issue to diagnostic PR
5. **Exits gracefully**: Returns exit code 0 (success)

**Exit code semantics:**

- Exit 0 = Success (PR updated and ready for review)
- Exit 1 = Error (GitHub API failure)

The workflow treats no-changes as successful completion, not an error. Users review the diagnostic PR to determine if work is already done.

See [No Code Changes Handling](no-changes-handling.md) for details.

---

## Phase 5: PR Finalization & Merge

The final phase prepares the PR for review and merge.

### `/erk:git-pr-push` Submission

The pure git submission flow:

1. Analyze staged changes
2. Generate AI commit message
3. Commit with proper attribution
4. Push to remote
5. Update PR body with summary

### `.worker-impl/` Cleanup

In GitHub Actions, `.worker-impl/` is removed in a separate commit:

```bash
git rm -rf .worker-impl/
git commit -m "Remove .worker-impl/ folder after implementation"
git push
```

This keeps the implementation commit clean.

### PR Ready for Review

```bash
gh pr ready "$BRANCH_NAME"
```

Marks the draft PR as ready for review.

### PR Body Update

The PR body is updated with:

1. Implementation summary (from commit message)
2. Standardized footer from `get-pr-body-footer`
3. Checkout instructions

### CI Trigger

An empty commit triggers push-event workflows:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger CI workflows"
git push
```

This is needed because workflow dispatch doesn't trigger PR workflows.

### Auto-Close on Merge

GitHub automatically closes the linked issue when the PR is merged if the commit message contains "Closes #N" or similar keywords.

The `gt finalize` command (used during PR finalization) adds the closing keyword to the commit message, ensuring the issue is closed when the PR merges.

---

## State Linking Mechanisms

Entities are connected through GitHub's native linking and deterministic metadata.

### Branch → Issue

Branches are named with the issue number prefix (e.g., `123-feature-name-01-15-1430`), making the association clear but not relying on GitHub's native branch linking.

### PR → Issue

PRs are linked to issues through:

- **PR body**: Contains `**Plan:** #<issue_number>` reference
- **Commit message**: The `gt finalize` command adds "Closes #N" keyword to ensure issue closure on merge

### Issue → Workflow Run

The `plan-header` metadata block contains:

```yaml
last_dispatched_run_id: "1234567890"
last_dispatched_at: 2025-01-15T10:30:00Z
```

Updated by `erk exec update-dispatch-info` command.

### Workflow Run → Issue

The workflow receives `issue_number` as input:

```yaml
inputs:
  issue_number:
    description: "GitHub issue number to implement"
    required: true
```

Available throughout as `${{ inputs.issue_number }}`.

### Run Discovery

The `distinct_id` enables finding the specific workflow run:

1. **Generation**: 6-char base36 created at dispatch time
2. **Run name**: Set to `"{issue_number}:{distinct_id}"`
3. **Polling**: Match runs by `displayTitle` containing `:distinct_id`

---

## Metadata Block Reference

All metadata blocks use a consistent format:

````html
<!-- erk:metadata-block:{key} -->
<details>
  <summary><code>{key}</code></summary>

  ```yaml {structured_data} ```
</details>
<!-- /erk:metadata-block:{key} -->
````

## Quick State Reconstruction

### From Issue Number

```bash
# Get issue details
gh issue view 123 --json title,body,comments,labels

# Find branches for this issue (by naming convention: 123-*)
git branch -r | grep "origin/123-"

# Find associated PR (by branch name)
BRANCH=$(git branch -r | grep "origin/123-" | head -1 | sed 's/origin\///')
gh pr list --head "$BRANCH"

# Find workflow runs
gh run list --workflow=erk-impl.yml | grep "123:"
```

### From Branch Name

```bash
# Get branch info
git log origin/123-add-user-authentic-11-30-1430 --oneline -5

# Find PR
gh pr view 123-add-user-authentic-11-30-1430

# Check for .worker-impl/
git ls-tree origin/123-add-user-authentic-11-30-1430 | grep worker-impl
```

### From PR Number

```bash
# Get PR details
gh pr view 456 --json title,body,headRefName

# Get linked issues via GitHub's native linking
gh pr view 456 --json closingIssuesReferences -q '.closingIssuesReferences[].number'
```

### From Workflow Run

```bash
# Get run details
gh run view 1234567890

# Extract issue from run name (format: "123:abc123")
gh run view 1234567890 --json displayTitle -q '.displayTitle' | cut -d: -f1
```
