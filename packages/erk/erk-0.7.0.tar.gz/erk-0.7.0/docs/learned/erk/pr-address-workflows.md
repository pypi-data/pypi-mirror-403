# PR Address Workflows

Erk provides two workflows for addressing PR review comments using Claude:

1. **Local** (`/erk:pr-address`) - Claude Code slash command, runs in your terminal
2. **Remote** (`erk pr address-remote`) - GitHub Actions workflow, runs in CI

## Decision Matrix

| Factor                       | Local                        | Remote                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Branch checkout**          | Required (must be on branch) | Not required                    |
| **Interactive confirmation** | Yes (via Claude Code)        | No                              |
| **Error recovery**           | Immediate (fix and retry)    | Check workflow logs             |
| **Plan metadata tracking**   | Manual                       | Automatic for P{issue} branches |
| **Best for**                 | Active development           | Queued/async work               |

## Local Workflow: /erk:pr-address

The `/erk:pr-address` slash command addresses review comments on the current branch.

### Usage

```bash
# Must be on the PR branch
erk br co my-feature
/erk:pr-address
```

### What it does

1. Fetches unresolved review comments from GitHub
2. Presents each comment to Claude for addressing
3. Claude makes code changes to address the feedback
4. You review and commit the changes

### When to use

- You're actively working on the branch
- You want interactive control over changes
- You want to review changes before committing

## Remote Workflow: erk pr address-remote

The `erk pr address-remote` command triggers a GitHub Actions workflow to address comments without local checkout.

### Usage

```bash
# From any directory in the repo
erk pr address-remote 123

# With a specific model
erk pr address-remote 123 --model claude-opus-4
```

### What it does

1. Triggers `pr-address.yml` GitHub Actions workflow
2. Workflow checks out the PR branch
3. Runs `/erk:pr-address` in CI
4. Pushes any changes
5. Posts a summary comment on the PR

### Plan Dispatch Metadata Tracking

When the branch name follows the `P{issue_number}-*` pattern (e.g., `P5819-add-feature`), the command automatically updates the plan issue with dispatch metadata:

- `last_dispatch_run_id` - The workflow run ID
- `last_dispatch_node_id` - The workflow run node ID (for GraphQL)
- `last_dispatched_at` - ISO timestamp

This enables tracking which workflow runs are associated with which plans.

### Requirements

- PR must exist and be OPEN
- GitHub Actions secrets configured:
  - `ERK_QUEUE_GH_PAT` - PAT with `repo` scope
  - `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

### When to use

- You don't want to switch branches locally
- You're processing multiple PRs in a queue
- You want async/background processing

## Summary Comment

After the remote workflow completes, it posts (or updates) a summary comment on the PR with:

- Model used
- Job status (success/failure)
- Link to workflow run
- Summary of changes made

The comment uses the marker `<!-- erk:pr-address-run -->` to find and update existing comments.
