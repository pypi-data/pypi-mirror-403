# PR Finalization Paths

The erk system has two distinct code paths for finalizing PRs. Both should behave identically - the key principle is that commands should auto-read from `.impl/issue.json` rather than requiring explicit parameters.

## Local Path (Graphite)

- **Entry point:** `finalize.py` in `erk-shared`
- **Used when:** Running `gt ss` or local PR submission
- **Issue reference:** Auto-reads from `.impl/issue.json`
- **Behavior:** Adds 'Closes #N' to PR body if issue reference exists

## Remote Path (GitHub Actions)

- **Entry point:** `erk-impl.yml` workflow
- **Used when:** Running `erk plan submit` for remote queue
- **Issue reference:** Must be passed to commands OR auto-read from `.impl/issue.json`
- **PR body update:** Via `get-pr-body-footer` command

## Key Principle

Both paths should behave identically. Commands should auto-read from `.impl/issue.json` rather than requiring explicit parameters.

## Anti-Pattern

Requiring callers to explicitly pass `--issue-number` when `.impl/issue.json` exists. This creates unnecessary coupling and makes the remote path behave differently from the local path.
