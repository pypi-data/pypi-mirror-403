"""Service for efficiently fetching plan list data via batched API calls.

Uses GraphQL nodes(ids: [...]) for O(1) batch lookup of workflow runs (~200ms for any N).
All plan issues store last_dispatched_node_id in the plan-header metadata block.

Performance optimization: When PR linkages are needed, uses unified GraphQL query via
get_issues_with_pr_linkages() to fetch issues + PR linkages in a single API call (~600ms),
instead of separate calls for issues (~500ms) and PR linkages (~1500ms).
