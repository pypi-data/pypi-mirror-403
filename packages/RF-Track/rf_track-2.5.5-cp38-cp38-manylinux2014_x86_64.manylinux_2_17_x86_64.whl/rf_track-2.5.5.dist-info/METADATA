RF-Track is a tracking code developed at CERN for the design and optimisation of particle accelerators, offering outstanding flexibility and rapid simulation speed.

RF-Track can simulate beams of particles of any energy, mass and charge, even mixed, solving fully relativistic equations of motion.  It can simulate the effects of space-charge forces in both bunched and continuous-wave beams, synchrotron radiation emission, wakefield and beam-loading effects, multiple Coulomb scattering, inverse Compton scattering, and the list is still growing. It can transport beams through both conventional and special elements: 1D, 2D and 3D static or oscillating radio-frequency electromagnetic field maps (standing wave and traveling wave), flux concentrators and electron coolers. It allows element overlap and direct and indirect space charge calculations using fast parallel algorithms.

RF-Track is written in optimised and parallel C++ and comes with two distinct and independent user interfaces: one in Octave and one in Python. General knowledge of Octave or Python is recommended to get the most out of RF-Track.
