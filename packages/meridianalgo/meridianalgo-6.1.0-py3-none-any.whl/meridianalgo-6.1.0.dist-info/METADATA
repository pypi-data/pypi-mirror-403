## Installation

### Standard Installation

Install the base package via pip:

```bash
pip install meridianalgo
```

### Optional Dependencies

MeridianAlgo supports several optional feature sets:

```bash
# Machine learning support (PyTorch/TensorFlow)
pip install meridianalgo[ml]

# Full suite (recommended for researchers)
pip install meridianalgo[full]

# Distributed computing support (Ray/Dask)
pip install meridianalgo[all]
```

---

## Basic Usage

```python
import meridianalgo as ma

# Quick analysis of market data
data = ma.get_market_data_quick(['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL'], start='2023-01-01')
analysis = ma.quick_analysis(data['AAPL']['Close'])

print(f"Sharpe Ratio: {analysis['sharpe_ratio']:.2f}")
print(f"Max Drawdown: {analysis['max_drawdown']:.1%}")
print(f"Win Rate: {analysis['win_rate']:.1%}")
```

---

## Core Modules

### Portfolio Analytics
Generate comprehensive performance metrics and tear sheets, similar to Pyfolio but enhanced for modern workloads.

```python
from meridianalgo.analytics import TearSheet

ts = TearSheet(returns, benchmark=spy_returns)
ts.create_full_tear_sheet(filename='report.pdf')
metrics = ts.get_metrics_summary()
```

### Market Microstructure
Analyze order book dynamics, toxicity, and liquidity using state-of-the-art models.

```python
from meridianalgo.liquidity import OrderBookAnalyzer, VPIN

# Order book insights
analyzer = OrderBookAnalyzer()
imbalance = analyzer.order_imbalance()

# Flow toxicity estimation
vpin = VPIN(trades)
toxicity = vpin.current_vpin()
```

### Risk Management
Institutional risk metrics including VaR, CVaR, and stress testing.

```python
from meridianalgo.risk import RiskAnalyzer

risk = RiskAnalyzer(returns)
var_95 = risk.value_at_risk(0.95, method='cornish_fisher')
stress_results = risk.stress_test({'Market Crash': -0.20})
```

---

## Testing

MeridianAlgo maintains a high standard of code quality with extensive test coverage.

```bash
# Run the full test suite
pytest tests/ -v

# Run with coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=meridianalgo --cov-report=term
```
