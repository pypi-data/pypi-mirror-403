    ## Objective
    You are a specialized AI proficient in spatial reasoning and solving puzzles from the game 'The Witness'. Your goal is to find a valid path (a continuous line) from the specified Start Node to the End Node on the provided grid, adhering to all puzzle rules.

    ## Core Concepts & Grid Basics
    *   **Grid Dimensions:** The puzzle grid has {grid_size['width']} columns and {grid_size['height']} rows.
    *   **Coordinate System:** Nodes are identified by `(x, y)` coordinates. `(0,0)` is the top-left node. `x` increases to the right, `y` increases downwards.
    *   **Path:** The solution is a single, continuous line connecting adjacent nodes either horizontally or vertically.
    *   **No Revisits:** The path **CANNOT** visit the same node more than once.
    *   **Valid Path Cells:** The path travels along the grid lines (edges between nodes). It can only occupy positions marked `+` or `.` in the grid layout (these correspond to positions with at least one even coordinate).
    *   **Rule Cells:** Cells containing rule symbols (squares, stars, etc.) have coordinates where both `x` and `y` are odd. The path goes *around* these rule cells, never *on* them.
    *   **Regions:** The drawn path divides the grid cells into one or more distinct enclosed areas (regions). Many rules apply based on the contents of these regions.

    ## Symbol Legend (Grid Notation)
    *   `S`: **Start Node** (Path begins here)
    *   `E`: **End Node** (Path ends here)
    *   `+`: Valid cell for the path to occupy
    *   `N`: Empty rule cell (no rule)
    *   `G`: **Gap** (Path **CANNOT** cross this cell)
    *   `.`: **Dot** (Path **MUST** pass through this cell)
    *   `o-X`: **Square** of color X
    *   `*-X`: **Star** of color X
    *   `A-X`: **Triangle** (touch 1 edge)
    *   `B-X`: **Triangle** (touch 2 edges)
    *   `C-X`: **Triangle** (touch 3 edges)
    *   `D-X`: **Triangle** (touch 4 edges)
    *   `P-X-Y`: **Polyshape** (positive) of color X and shape ID Y
    *   `Y-X-Y`: **Negative Polyshape** (ylop) of color X and shape ID Y

    **Color Codes:** R=Red, B=Blue, G=Green, Y=Yellow, W=White, O=Orange, P=Purple, K=Black

    ## Detailed Solving Rules
    The drawn path must satisfy **ALL** applicable constraints:

    1.  **Path Constraints:**
        *   Path **MUST** start at `S` and end at `E`.
        *   Path connects adjacent nodes (horizontal/vertical moves only).
        *   Nodes **CANNOT** be revisited.
        *   Path **MUST** pass through all Dot (`.`) cells.
        *   Path **CANNOT** pass through any Gap (`G`) cells.

    2.  **Region-Based Rules** (Apply to areas enclosed by the path):
        *   **Squares (`o-X`):** All squares within a single region **MUST** be the same color. Squares of different colors **MUST** be separated into different regions by the path.
        *   **Stars (`*-X`):** Within a single region, each star symbol **MUST** be paired with exactly **ONE** other element (star or square) *of the same color*. Other colors within the region are irrelevant to this specific star's rule.
        *   **Polyshapes (`P-X-Y`):** The region containing this symbol **MUST** be able to contain the specified shape (defined in Polyshape Definitions). The shape must fit entirely within the region's boundaries. If multiple positive polyshapes are in one region, the region must accommodate their combined, non-overlapping forms. Rotation of polyshapes is NOT allowed. They must fit within the provided space in their given orientation.
        *   **Negative Polyshapes (`Y-X-Y`):** These "subtract" shape requirements, typically within the same region as corresponding positive polyshapes. A negative polyshape cancels out a positive polyshape of the exact same shape and color within that region. If all positive shapes are canceled, the region has no shape constraint. A negative shape is only considered 'used' if it cancels a positive one. Negative shapes can sometimes rationalize apparent overlaps or boundary violations of positive shapes if interpreted as cancellations.

    3.  **Path-Based Rules (Edge Touching):**
        *   **Triangles (`A-X`, `B-X`, `C-X`, `D-X`):** The path **MUST** touch a specific number of edges of the cell containing the triangle symbol.
            *   `A-X` (1): Path touches **EXACTLY 1** edge of the triangle's cell.
            *   `B-X` (2): Path touches **EXACTLY 2** edges of the triangle's cell.
            *   `C-X` (3): Path touches **EXACTLY 3** edges of the triangle's cell.
            *   `D-X` (4): Path touches **EXACTLY 4** edges (fully surrounds) the triangle's cell.

    ## EXAMPLE PUZZLE GRID:

    ["+",".","+","+","+","E","+"]
    ["+","C-R","+","o-K","+","o-K","+"]
    ["S","+","+","+","+","+","+"]
    ["+","P-G-112","+","*-G","+","P-B-624","+"]
    ["+","+","+","+","+","+","+"]
    ["+","*-G","+","*-G","+","o-K","+"]
    ["+","+","+",".","+","+","+"]

    EXAMPLE POLYSHAPE DEFINITIONS:
    Shape 112:
    [0,1,0,0]
    [0,1,0,0]
    [0,1,0,0]
    [0,0,0,0]

    Shape 624:
    [0,1,0,0]
    [0,1,1,0]
    [0,1,0,0]
    [0,0,0,0]

    EXAMPLE SOLUTION:

    We start at (0,2) and draw a line to (0,0).
    We then draw a line to (2,0) to reach the dot at (1,0) and surround the 3 count triangle.
    We then draw a line to (2,2) here we go down to touch the third side of the triangle cell and therefore validate the 3 count triangle.
    We continue down to (2,6) to validate the polyshape 112 and also the green star with the green polyshape
    After this we draw a line to (4,6) to start validating the polyshape 624 by surrounding it.
    Therefore we have to draw a line to (6,4) over (4,4) which creates a region for the stone at (5,5) which validates the stone.
    We continue up to (6,2) for the polyshape 624 and then go to (4,2) and after this to (4,0) to finaly validate the polyshape 624.
    This also validates the two green stars at (3,3) and (3,5) with each other and the black stone at (3,1) because its the only stone in its region.
    This line also creates a region for the black stone at (5,1) because its the only stone in its region.
    Now we can draw a line to (5,0) to reach the end node.
