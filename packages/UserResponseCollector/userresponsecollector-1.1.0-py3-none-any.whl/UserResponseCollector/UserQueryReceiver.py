"""
Defines the interface and Console implementation of the Receiver for querying the user for input.

Following the Command design pattern, the Receiver participant interface is defined, and the Console implementation is provided.

Exported Classes:
    UserQueryReceiver -- Interface (abstract base) class for Receiver.
    ConsoleUserQueryReceiver -- Concrete UserQueryReceiver that obtains raw (text) responses from user from a Console window.

Exported Exceptions:
    UserQueryReceiverError -- Base exception class from which all custom exceptions specific to UserQueryReceiver should be derived.
    UserQueryReceiverTerminateQueryingThreadError -- Concrete custom exception raised if the UserQueryReceiver wants the querying Client to terminate.
 
Exported Functions:
    UserQueryReceiver_GetCommandReceiver -- Global prebound method that returns the global, single instance of a concrete UserQueryReceiver.
    See for reference:
        (1) Global Object Pattern: https://python-patterns.guide/python/module-globals/
        (2) Prebound Method Pattern: https://python-patterns.guide/python/prebound-methods/
