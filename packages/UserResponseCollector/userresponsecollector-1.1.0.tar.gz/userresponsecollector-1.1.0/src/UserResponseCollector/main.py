"""
This module provides a simple console application for testing the UserQueryReceiver and UserQueryCommand components.
The code in this module illustrates how to use these components to interactively query the user for different types of input.

__main__ executes a loop that asks the user to choose different query types to perform,
demonstrating the functionality of the UserQueryReceiver and various UserQueryCommand implementations.

Exported Classes:
    None

Exported Exceptions:
    None
 
Exported Functions:
    do_MenuQuery -- Use UserQueryReceiver and UserQueryCommandMenu to make a Menu query.
    do_NumberIntegerQuery -- Use UserQueryReceiver and UserQueryCommandNumberInteger to make a NumberInteger query.
    do_NumberFloatQuery -- Use UserQueryReceiver and UserQueryCommandNumberFloat to make a NumberFloat query.
    do_StringQuery -- Use UserQueryReceiver and UserQueryCommandStr to make a Str query.
    do_PathSaveQuery -- Use UserQueryReceiver and UserQueryCommandPathSave to make a PathSave query.
    do_PathOpenQuery -- Use UserQueryReceiver and UserQueryCommandPathOpen to make a PathOpen query.
    do_Debug -- Change the code inside this function to facilitate debugging.
