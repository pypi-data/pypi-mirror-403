"""
Defines the interface and concrete implementations of UserQueryCommands classes that know how to query the
user for different types of input (e.g., menu choice, integer number, file path) via a UserQueryReceiver concrete
implementation.

Following the Command design pattern, the Command participant interface is defined, and and multiple ConcreteCommand
implementations are provided.

Exported Classes:
    UserQueryCommand -- Interface (abstract base) class for Command.
    UserQueryCommandX -- Concrete UserQueryCommand that invokes methods on UserQueryReceiver to obtain user input of type X.

    Each UserQueryCommandX must by convention and necessity implement these methods:
        (1) _doCreatePromptText() - Returns string of text used to prompt user for input
        (2) _doProcessRawResponse(...) - Converts the raw response text string of user input to an object of required type
        (3) doValidateProcessedResponse(...) - Tests that the object of required type meets any other requirements, such
										   as that an entered integer is greater than or equal to a minimum value
    Each UserQueryCommandX may optionally extend:
        (4) _doGetExtraDict() - Returns dictionary of key/value pairs to pass to UserQueryReceiver.GetRawResponse(...) method.
            Note: Clients must assume that the UserQueryReceiver implementation may ignore this parameter.
    
Exported Exceptions:
    None    
 
Exported Functions:
    askForMenuSelection(...) -- Convenience function to query user to select a menu option without using objects.
    askForInt(...) -- Convenience function to query user for an integer number without using objects.
    askForFloat(...) -- Convenience function to query user for a floating point number without using objects.
    askForStr(...) -- Convenience function to query user for a text string without using objects.
    askForPathSave(...) -- Convenience function to query user for a path to save a file without using objects.
    askForPathOpen(...) -- Convenience function to query user for a path to open a file without using objects.
