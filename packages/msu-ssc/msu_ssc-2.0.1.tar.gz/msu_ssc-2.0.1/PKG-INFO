# MSU SSC tools

Various Python tools for the Morehead State University (MSU) Space Science Center (SSC). This repo is owned by [David Mayo](https://github.com/davidmayo).

## Usage

Tools are written and tested in Linux (Ubuntu) with Python 3.10. More details on all this forthcoming.

In particular, this uses the `src` layout, with all the code being in `./src/msu_ssc`, so `./src` will need to be added to $PYTHONPATH to use this at all.

## Provenance

These tools are largely written by [David Mayo](https://github.com/davidmayo), starting in January 2025.

Some of this code dates back many years ago, written by many different Space Science Center personnel over the years, with no git history to speak of.
