*Optical constants for elements and various materials in the EUV and VUV wavelengths.*

Welcome! This is ocdb, a **Python package** for easily accessing the X-ray/EUV/VUV **scattering and absorption data** contained in the `Optical Constants Database (OCDB) <https://www.ocdb.ptb.de/>`_ provided by the German National Metrology Institute, the `Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, PTB <https://www.ptb.de/>`_.


Features
========

A list of (planned) features:

* Access to X-ray/EUV/VUV scattering and absorption coefficients (*n* and *k*)

* Interface compatible to the `periodictable Python package <https://pypi.org/project/periodictable/>`_

* Provides data *and* uncertainties

* FAIR and linked data: citable, reliable, and reproducible

* Offline access: data contained in package

* Community-driven: easy to contribute


And to make it even more convenient for users and future-proof:

* Open source project written in Python (>= 3.9)

* Developed fully test-driven

* Extensive user and API documentation


Installation
============

To install the ocdb package on your computer (sensibly within a Python virtual environment), open a terminal (activate your virtual environment), and type in the following::

    pip install ocdb
