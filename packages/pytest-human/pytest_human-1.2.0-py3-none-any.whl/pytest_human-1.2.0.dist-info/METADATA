              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution

              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

A pytest plugin for generating beautiful, human-readable HTML reports for individual tests with collapsible nested logging spans and syntax highlighting. Inspired by Robot Framework and Playwright reports.

Unlike other pytest HTML report plugins, **pytest-human** creates a separate HTML log file for each test, aimed at helping you dive into specific parts of the test that are relevant for debugging, while hiding unrelated logs.

Works with standard python logging, no need to rewrite existing tests to get going!


## Features
* Logs
  * Beautiful test logs
  * Collapsible spans
  * Syntax highlighting
  * Colored log levels
  * Support for existing native python logging
  * Streaming log writing
* Tracing
  * Automatic fixture logging
  * Automatic method call logging
  * Third-party method tracing
* Debugging
  * Deep error highlighting
  * Regex search in collapsed spans
  * Artifacts collection


## Demo

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c9932b1-396c-4705-ba7d-95fbff7f07be

[Example Report](https://q-dev-public-bucket.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/pytest-human/static-html/test_pizza.html) and test [source file](tests/examples/test_pizza.py).

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pytest-human
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

1. Enable the plugin when running pytest:

    ```bash
    pytest --enable-html-log
    ```

2. Use the `human` object and the `@traced` decorator in your tests:

    ```python
    from pytest_human.tracing import traced
    from pytest_human.log import get_logger

    log = get_logger(__name__)

    # Each call to this function will be logged
    @traced
    def insert_db(data):
        query = "INSERT INTO flowers (petals) VALUES ('{{1,2,3,4,5}}');"
        log.info(f"executing {query=}")
        return len(data)

    def test_example(human):
        """This test demonstrates pytest-human logging."""
        human.log.info("Established test agent connection")

        with human.span.info("Generating sample data"):
            data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
            human.log.info(f"Loaded sample data {data=} {len(data)=}", highlight=True)
            insert_db(data)

            with human.span.debug("Validating sample"):
                result = sum(data)
                human.log.debug(f"Sum {result=}", highlight=True)

        assert result == 15
    ```

3. Open the HTML test log

    At the end of individual tests you will see a similar line:

    ```console
    🌎 Test test_example HTML log at file:///tmp/pytest-of-john.doe/pytest-2/session_logs/test_example.html
    ```

    You can <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd>-Click the link in most terminals to open the file.

4. Debug!

## Command Line Options

### Enable HTML Logging


```bash
# To enable HTML logging support and use this plugin, pass this flag

pytest --enable-html-log
```

### Log Location

Control where HTML logs are saved:

```bash
# Save all test logs in a custom directory specified by the user.
pytest --html-output-dir /path/to/logs

# By default logs are saved in the session temp directory with the test name
# e.g. /tmp/pytest-of-user.name/pytest-446/session_logs/test_method_tracing.html
pytest --enable-html-log

# Save in individual test temporary directories as test.html
# e.g. /tmp/pytest-of-user.name/pytest-446/session_logs/test_examplecurrent/test.html
pytest --enable-html-log --html-use-test-tmp
```

### Log Level

Control the minimum log level:

```bash
# Use pytest's global log level.
# Opt to use this setting in order to capture non-human python logs.
pytest --enable-html-log --log-level DEBUG

# Set log level for HTML logs specifically.
pytest --enable-html-log --html-log-level INFO
```


### Quiet mode

`--html-quiet` reduces the amount of console messages generated by pytest, especially test files locations. Using pytest `-q` also achieves the same behavior.

### Logging to root logger

Human tracing and logs are logged by default only to the HTML log. If you would like to use the tracing features for the regular python log
you can use `--html-log-to-all`, which will log everything to the [root logger](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).

## Logger API

### Fixtures

- `human` - Supplies a human object to the test. Includes a logger and attachment collector.
- `test_log` - Supplies a logger to the test, equivalent to `human.log`.
- `human_test_log_path` - Path of the html log file for the current test
### Logging Methods

```python
def test_logging_methods(human):
    # Basic logging at different levels
    human.log.trace("Trace level message")
    human.log.debug("Debug level message")
    human.log.info("Info level message")
    human.log.warning("Warning level message")
    human.log.error("Error level message")
    human.log.critical("Critical level message")

    # Syntax highlighting for code
    code = """
    import numpy as np

    def bark(volume: float) -> bool:
        return volume > 0.5:
    """
    human.log.info(code, highlight=True)
```

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Q-cue-ai/pytest-human/refs/heads/main/assets/test_logging_methods.png)

### Direct logger access

Get the test logger programmatically, this allows to tweak the source name and is useful if you don't want to pass the human object around.

```python
from pytest_human.log import get_logger

def test_programmatic_logger():
    logger = get_logger(__name__)
    logger.info("Custom logger")
```

### Collapsible Spans

Create nested, collapsible sections in your HTML logs.

This allows partitioning the log into sections and diving only into the parts of the logs that are relevant to your debug session.


```python
def test_spans(human):
    human.log.info("Starting complex operation")

    with human.span.info("Phase 1: Initialization"):
        human.log.debug("Initializing resources...")

        with human.span.debug("Loading configuration"):
            human.log.trace("Reading config file")
            config = load_config()
            human.log.debug(f"Config loaded: {config}")

        human.log.info("Initialization complete")

    with human.span.info("Phase 2: Processing"):
        human.log.debug("Processing data...")
        process_data()

    human.log.info("Operation completed")
```

## Method Tracing


A lot of debug logging is centered around logging a function when called, returned a value or threw an error. Human supplies the `@traced` decorator to allow for automatic method tracing in log.

Each method call shows the function call parameters, opens a new span that includes all of the logging that happened in its scope, as well as its return value. This allows for easy segmentation of nested loggings and reduces the amount of noise encountered when debugging.


![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Q-cue-ai/pytest-human/refs/heads/main/assets/test_method_tracing.png)

```python
import logging
import time
from pytest_human.log import get_logger
from pytest_human.tracing import traced

# Add the @traced decorator for automatic logging of method call/return
@traced
def save_login(login):
    log = get_logger(__name__)
    log.info("a log inside save_login")
    return update_db(login)

@traced(log_level=logging.TRACE)
def update_db(login):
    log = get_logger(__name__)
    delay_time = 2
    log.info("delaying db update by 2 seconds")
    time.sleep(delay_time)
    return delay_time

def test_method_tracing(human):
    delay = save_login("hello")
    assert delay == 2
```

`@traced` supports the following parameters:
* `suppress_return` - do not log the return value, useful when it is overly long
* `suppress_params` - do not log the method parameters, useful when they are overly long
* `suppress_self` - do not show the `self` argument logging function parameters, default `True`
* `suppress_none` - do not show parameters with the value `None`, can clean up traces of highly parameterized functions, default `False`.
* `truncate_values` - truncates overly long values in traces, default `True`.
* `log_level` - set a log level for the method trace

Note: tracing will have some performance implications on method calls, also you should limit using `@traced` on frequently
called functions as to reduce log noise.

### Third-party method tracing

The `@traced` decorator is very useful for debugging but it is unfortunately restricted to code you own.

In order to trace third-party methods, you can use the `trace_calls` and `trace_public_api` methods, which wrap third party code with human tracing.

`trace_calls` adds tracing to a list of functions, while `trace_public_api` adds tracing to all public methods of modules/classes.

```python
import pytest
from playwright.sync_api import Locator, LocatorAssertions, Page
from pytest_human.tracing import trace_calls, trace_public_api

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def log_3rdparty_methods():
    with (
        trace_calls(
            pytest.Pytester.runpytest,
            pytest.Pytester.makepyfile,
        ),

        # set a custom configuration for a traced function
        trace_calls(Page.screenshot, suppress_return=True, suppress_self=False, suppress_none=True),

        # this skips Page.screenshot as it is already defined above
        trace_public_api(
            Page, Locator, LocatorAssertions, suppress_self=False, suppress_none=True
        ),

        # alternatively use a full string path. This also works when regular objects fail.
        trace_calls("requests.get")
    ):
        yield
```

### Fixture tracing

Each fixture setup and teardown calls are traced with parameters and return value, similar to the `@traced` decorator. This happens without any user action and are located in the `Test Setup` and `Test Teardown` spans.

## Artifacts

Sometimes you might have extra logs that are generated by subprocesses or used external resources such as Kubernetes, Docker or others.
Human automatically collects stdout/stderr and allows you to collect custom logs to be attached to the log.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Q-cue-ai/pytest-human/refs/heads/main/assets/test_artifacts.png)

```python
def test_artifacts(human):
    human.log.info("Attaching artifacts to the test log")

    print("logging something to stdout")

    log_content = """
    [10:00:01] First line of the log.
    [10:00:03] Line 2 of the log.
    [10:00:05] Line 3 of the log.
    """
    human.artifacts.add_log_text(log_content, "sample.log", description="Sample log file")
```

## Logging

### Using Standard Python Logging

pytest-human integrates with Python's standard logging system. All logs from any logger will be captured:

```python
import logging

def test_standard_logging(human):
    # pytest-human logger
    human.log.info("Using human fixture")

    # Standard Python logger - also captured in HTML
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.info("Using standard logger")
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Python logger is captured through the root logger, and will only be captured according to its log level.
> You can change the root log level from pytest using the `--log-level` switch.

### TRACE Logging

pytest-human adds a custom `TRACE` log level below `DEBUG` for more verbose logging:

```python
def test_trace_logging(human):
    human.log.trace("Very detailed trace information")
```

Run with trace level:

```bash
pytest --enable-html-log --log-level trace
```


## Keyboard navigation
You can use the keyboard to navigate around the log.
* Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to jump between the expand buttons (+).
* Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to expand and collapse a span when hovering over a button.
* Press <kbd>/</kbd> to jump to the search box and <kbd>Esc</kbd> to unfocus.
* When searching use <kbd>Enter</kbd> to jump to the next result and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> to jump to the previous result.
