# Introduction

## Rationale

Taking inspiration from the [Contract-First Development](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/contract-first-development/) approach, this small tool aims to simplify the development of Python CLI with [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) to be integrated in [CWL Command Line Tool](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/topics/command-line-tool.html).

Defining the Interface(s) first in the CWL not only speeds up the development, it also alleviates developers to manually write the boilerplate code to implement the CLIs.

## Usage

### Installation

`cwl2click` is published on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/cwl2click/), users just have to execute

```
pip install cwl2click
```
