# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v2.2.9] - 2025-12-20

### ✅ MVP Hardening: Immutable, Verifiable Context Records

*   **CRS-001 immutability enforcement:** Stores reject attempts to overwrite an existing `context_id` with different content.
*   **Content-addressed lookups:** Fetch CRS-001 records by `record_hash` (`sha256:...`) via CLI and `GET /v1/record/{record_ref}`.
*   **Optional signing:** HMAC signatures over `record_hash` for offline verification (configurable via `FABRA_SIGNING_KEY` / `FABRA_SIGNATURE_MODE`).
*   **Security CI:** Added dependency scanning in CI (pip-audit + OSV Scanner).

---

## [v2.3.0] - 2025-12-22

### ✅ Privacy Mode: Omit Raw Content

*   **Configurable content persistence:** `FABRA_RECORD_INCLUDE_CONTENT=0` omits raw `content` from persisted CRS-001 records and `context_log`.
*   **Doc clarity:** Added privacy guidance and clarified HMAC signing threat model.

---

## [v2.3.1] - 2025-12-28

### ✅ Context Ticket Handles

*   **Context API returns hashes:** `record_hash` / `content_hash` returned alongside `context_id` for durable ticket references.
*   **Logging helpers:** exporters can emit `context_id` plus hashes for incident/audit logs.

---

## [v2.3.2] - 2025-12-30

### ✅ Interaction Timeline (Pass-Through)

*   **Interaction references:** contexts can include `interaction_ref` (e.g. `call_id` / `turn_id` / `turn_index`) in `inputs` and API responses for voice timeline replay.
*   **Docs:** exporters guide uses `emit_context_ref_json` for durable ticket references.

---

## [v1.4.0] - 2025-12-09

### 🚀 Major Features: Context Accountability

*   **Context Lineage Tracking:** Automatically track exactly what data was used in every context assembly.
    *   `FeatureLineage` records which features were retrieved, their values, timestamps, and freshness.
    *   `RetrieverLineage` records which retrievers were called, queries, result counts, and latencies.
    *   `ContextLineage` provides full assembly statistics including items dropped, token usage, and cost.
*   **UUIDv7 Context Identifiers:** Time-sortable unique IDs for efficient querying and debugging.
*   **Context Replay API:** Retrieve any historical context by ID for debugging and compliance.
    *   `store.get_context_at(context_id)` - Get full context with lineage.
    *   `store.list_contexts(start, end, limit)` - List contexts in a time range.
*   **REST API Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /v1/contexts` - List contexts with time filtering.
    *   `GET /v1/context/{id}` - Retrieve full context by ID.
    *   `GET /v1/context/{id}/lineage` - Get just the lineage data.

    *   `fabra context export <id>` - Export context for audit (JSON/YAML).

### 🔧 Improvements

*   `AssemblyTracker` uses contextvars for clean lineage tracking without API changes.
