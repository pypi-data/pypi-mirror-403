## Recommendation

**PAUSE and continue in next fresh session**

**Reason:**
- Context at 122K/200K (61% used)
- Handler implementation needs ~200 lines of careful code
- Testing requires validation
- Better to implement with full context for quality

**Time Remaining:** ~4-5 hours to complete

---

## Quick Resume Guide

When resuming:

1. **Read:** V1.0.3_HANDLERS_TO_IMPLEMENT.md
2. **Add handlers** to sap_datasphere_mcp_server.py after browse_marketplace
3. **Add authorization** rules
4. **Test** both tools
5. **Update docs** and publish

---

## Alternative: Minimal v1.0.3

If you want to publish NOW with what we have:

**Option: Revert to 42 tools, publish v1.0.2**
```bash
# Revert version to 1.0.2
# Remove the 2 new tool registrations
# Build and publish v1.0.2
```

**OR: Continue now** (risky with 61% context used)

**OR: Resume next session** (recommended)

---

**Your call!** We've made great progress - tool descriptions are done, just need handlers and testing.
