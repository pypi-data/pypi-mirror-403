"""
Tests for AsyncTyper class.

This module tests the AsyncTyper implementation to ensure it correctly
handles both sync and async commands.

Note: AsyncTyper wraps async functions with sync wrappers, so the decorated
function is sync even if the original was async. Tests reflect this behavior.
