# THE BACCO EMULATORS

baccoemu provides a collection of emulators for large-scale structure statistics over a wide range of
cosmologies.

## Installation

Follow detailed instructions at https://baccoemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#installation

Anyway, a quick installation should boil down to

```bash
pip install . [--user]
```

## Usage

Follow detailed instructions at https://baccoemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#quickstart

You can also find examples and tutorials in the examples and notebooks folders.
