Invenio module that provides OAuth web authorization support.

OAuth client support is typically used to allow features such as social login
(e.g. Sign in with Twitter) and access to resources owned by a specific user
at a remote service. Both OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 are supported.

Features:

- Views: OAuth login and authorized endpoints, linked account settings and
  sign-up handling.
- Client: A client to interact with remote applications.
- Contrib: Ready-to-use GitHub, ORCID, and CERN remote applications.
- Models: Persistence layer for OAuth access tokens including support for
  storing extra data together with a token.
- Handlers: Customizable handlers for deciding what happens when a user
  authorizes a request.

Changes
=======

Version v6.1.3 (released 2026-01-30)

- fix(logout): remove unmanage_roles from session

Version v6.1.2 (released 2026-01-27)

- chore(black): update formatting to >= 26.0
- chore(setup): pin dependencies

Version v6.1.1 (released 2025-12-08)

- i18n: pulled translations
- fix(refresh): allow non-compliant access token response type

Version v6.1.0 (released 2025-XX-XX)

- feat: support for refresh tokens

Version v6.0.0 (released 2025-11-03)

- perf(models): changed SQL column type of `extra_data` to `JSONB` instead of `JSON` for PostgreSQL

  - This migration could flood the WAL when run on very large `oauthclient_remoteaccount`
    tables (~50k+ rows) as well as causing a full lock that lasts several minutes and
    stops users from being able to log in with third-party accounts.
    This won't happen in the majority of cases. For instances not meeting this size
    criteria, the automated Alembic migration will suffice. However, for tables above
    this size, please use instead the step-by-step instructions in the
    upgrade guide (included in the documentation of this module).
