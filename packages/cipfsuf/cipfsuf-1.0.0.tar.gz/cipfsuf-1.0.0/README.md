## 💀 WHAT IS THIS SHIT?
**CIPFSUF** is a brutal propagation tool for the IPFS network. It was built because standard tools are slow, polite, and full of useless limitations. This tool is designed to make your content (like the **GNU Android Optimizer**) immortal by forcing global gateways to cache your data.

**CODE IS SACRED. PYTHON IS SACRED. C++ IS SACRED. ELF IS SACRED.**

## 🔥 FEATURES
* **Shard Core (C++):** Shreds your files into binary pieces so small that no firewall can catch them.
* **Global Blast (Python):** Uses a massive 50-worker thread pool to scream your CID at every public gateway on the planet simultaneously.
* **Dynamic Scraping:** Don't rely on hardcoded lists. It fetches the latest global gateways from the abyss of the internet.
* **Zero-Daemon Persistence:** Upload your shit, blast it, and turn off your Termux. The network is now your slave.

## ⚠️ WARNING (READ THIS OR GTFO)
1.  **I don't care** what you upload. You are responsible for your own digital ghosts.
2.  **No Limits:** This tool ignores "best practices." We don't want best practices; we want the file online forever.
3.  **Parasitic Hosting:** We are using third-party caches. If they don't like it, they shouldn't be running public gateways.

## 🛠 INSTALLATION & USAGE
Stop being a script kiddie and just run it:

```bash
# Shred and Push
./cipfsuf --push <YOUR_CID_HERE>
```
