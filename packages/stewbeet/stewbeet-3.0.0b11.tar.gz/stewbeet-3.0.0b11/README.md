## ❓ What is `StewBeet`
`StewBeet` is a [Beet](https://github.com/mcbeet/beet) framework and library 📦 aiming to provide huge automation for creating Minecraft datapacks.<br>
It is designed to be very simple to use and very convenient for developers.

`Example of the in-game manual generated by StewBeet:`<br>
![In-game Manual Example](https://i.imgur.com/dtuAG99.gif)


Here is a list of features that the package provides (the template is using all of them with clear comments):

- 🔄 Automatic resource pack files generation (models, textures, sounds, music discs) with the ability to override them with help of the `assets` folder.
- ⏳ Versioned load, and clock functions such as `tick`, `second`, `minute`.
- 🗃️ Loot tables for every item in the `definitions` along with a proper `_give_all` function that gives named chests.
- 📖 Automatic generation of a really [advanced and interactive items `manual`](./assets/in_game_manual_example.png).
- 📝 Automatic generation of a `en-us.json` lang file in the resource pack if configuration is set.
- 🖼️ Automatic headers for every function in `function` folders.
- 📦 Minecraft like vanilla recipes unlocking.
- 📚 Official libraries integrations:
  - 🧪 Automatic support for NBT Recipes with [`Smithed Crafter`](https://wiki.smithed.dev/libraries/crafter/) and [`Furnace NBT Recipes`](https://github.com/Stoupy51/FurnaceNbtRecipes/)
  - 🛠️ Placement and destruction for every custom block in the `definitions` with support for blockstates, ore drops (fortune, silk touch), with [`Smithed Custom Blocks`](https://wiki.smithed.dev/libraries/custom-block/).
  - 📚 Each module from [`Bookshelf`](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/bookshelf) is automatically added if you are using it, ex: `function #bs.math:...` will add the `bs.math` module to the datapack.
  - ⛏️ Custom ore generation with [`Smart Ore Generation`](https://github.com/Stoupy51/SmartOreGeneration).
  - 📦 Item transportation / container declaration with [`ItemIO`](https://github.com/edayot/ItemIO) when making custom containers.
  - 🔔 Events such as new items detection with [`Common Signals`](https://github.com/Stoupy51/CommonSignals).
- 🌐 External datapack libraries support, see configuration for more information.
- 🔗 Merging datapacks and resource packs with libraries using [Smithed Weld](https://weld.smithed.dev/).
- 🧩 Automatic recognition of custom blocks patterns depending on the texture names in the `assets/textures` folder. For instance, if you have a top, side, and bottom texture, the block will be automatically recognized as a cube with the top, side, and bottom textures.
- 📏 Follow the datapack conventions such as [LanternLoad](https://github.com/LanternMC/load), [CustomModelData prefix](https://mcdatapack.vercel.app/), [tag specification](https://wiki.smithed.dev/conventions/tag-specification/), and [namespacing](https://wiki.smithed.dev/conventions/namespacing/).
- 🧰 Ability to merge a model with the autogenerated one or override it.
- 🔀 `merge` folder providing a way to merge custom files with the autogenerated ones or add custom files to the datapack.
- ⚙️ Automatic special compatibilities with datapacks such as [`SimpleDrawer's compacted drawer`](https://edayot.github.io/SimpleDrawer/material.html), [`SimplEnergy's pulverizer`](./build/datapack/data/your_namespace/function/calls/simplenergy/pulverizer_recipes.mcfunction).
- 📂 Automatic copy of generated zip files to configured folders.
