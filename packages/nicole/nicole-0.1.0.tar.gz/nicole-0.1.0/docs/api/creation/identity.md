## Description

Returns a tensor with two indices (original and flipped) containing identity matrices for each charge sector. Represents the Kronecker delta δᵢⱼ with symmetry structure.

## Block Structure

For each sector with charge `q` and dimension `d`:
- Block `(q, q)` contains the `d × d` identity matrix
- All other blocks are empty (not stored)

## Notes

The second index is automatically flipped (opposite direction) to enable contraction. Use for resolution of identity: ∑ᵢ |i⟩⟨i| = I.
