# Nicole: A Symmetry-Aware Tensor Library

Welcome to the documentation for **Nicole**, a Python library for symmetry-aware tensor computations, specifically designed for quantum many-body physics and tensor network algorithms.

## What is Nicole?

Nicole provides efficient block-sparse tensor operations that respect Abelian symmetries (U(1), Z₂, etc.), enabling memory-efficient and computationally optimized tensor network calculations. Created as part of the Ideogenesis-AI effort in studying quantum many-body systems, Nicole reimagines the block-symmetric tensor approach with a Python-native API built on NumPy, making it accessible to the broader scientific Python ecosystem while maintaining the mathematical rigor needed for quantum physics applications.

## Key Features

- **Block-Sparse Tensors**: Efficient representation of tensors with conserved quantum numbers
- **Abelian Symmetries**: Built-in support for U(1), Z₂, and their product groups
- **Charge Conservation**: Enforcement of selection rules through symmetry-aware indices
- **NumPy Backend**: Implementation using NumPy for high-performance dense operations
- **Tensor Network Operations**: Essential operations including contraction, trace, SVD, and more
- **Type-Safe API**: Modern Python with type hints for better IDE support
- **Extensible Design**: Clean abstractions for adding custom symmetry groups

## Quick Example

```python
from nicole import Tensor, Index, Sector, Direction, U1Group, trace

# Create a U(1) symmetric index (e.g., particle number conservation)
group = U1Group()
index = Index(
    Direction.OUT,
    group,
    sectors=(
        Sector(charge=0, dim=2),   # neutral sector, 2 states
        Sector(charge=1, dim=1),   # charge +1, 1 state
        Sector(charge=-1, dim=1),  # charge -1, 1 state
    )
)

# Create a random tensor with this symmetry
tensor = Tensor.random([index, index.flip()], itags=["i", "j"], seed=42)
print(tensor)
```

## Getting Started

New to Nicole? Start with the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide to learn the basics:

- Installation instructions
- Core concepts (symmetries, charges, sectors, indices)
- Your first tensor creation and manipulation
- Basic tensor operations

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into several sections:

- **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)**: Installation and basic usage
- **[API Reference](api/index.md)**: Comprehensive documentation for all classes and functions
- **[Examples](examples/index.md)**: Practical examples and use cases
- **[Tutorials](tutorials/index.md)**: In-depth guides for specific applications

## Use Cases

Nicole is designed for researchers and developers working on:

- **Tensor Network Algorithms**: DMRG, TEBD, PEPS, and other tensor network methods
- **Quantum Many-Body Physics**: Systems with conserved quantum numbers
- **Condensed Matter Theory**: Strongly correlated electron systems
- **Quantum Chemistry**: Fermionic and bosonic systems with symmetries

## Acknowledgments

Nicole is inspired by the [QSpace](https://bitbucket.org/qspace4u/) tensor library developed for MATLAB. While QSpace excels in complex symmetries (e.g. SU(N), Sp(N), SO(N)) with a C++ backend, Nicole focuses on providing a Python implementation for Abelian symmetries (SU(2) or more will come as a plugin) with an emphasis on clarity, extensibility, and integration with the scientific Python ecosystem.
