"""Docker orchestration utilities for DAO Treasury.

Provides functions to build, start, and stop Docker Compose services
required for analytics dashboards (Grafana, renderer). Integrates with
eth-portfolio's Docker setup and ensures all containers are managed
consistently for local analytics.

Key Responsibilities:
    - Build and manage Grafana and renderer containers.
    - Integrate with eth-portfolio Docker services.
    - Provide decorators/utilities for container lifecycle management.

This is the main entry for all Docker-based orchestration.
