## Schedule 1 The Licensed Software

This software is a custom framework developed by London AI Centre @ Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust. This framework has several characteristics:

  1. The framework enables mass synthetic data generation, and all fine-tuning is performed on synthetic data. This means that the model itself, prior to deployment, does not touch real patient data.

  2. The model is trained in the cloud, before being imported into NHS firewalls for deployment.

  3. Models are small parameter, which means they can be run locally in a fully private matter.

  4. The framework includes expert designed 'schema' for extracting and structuring data, that in themselves contain a substantial amount of intellectual input from clinical domain and machine learning experts, and a prompt framework around this.

This framework is physically contained in code repositories and documentation and is being used to train other LLMs that are adapted for specified domains, including extracting general comorbidities, general medical histories, clinical coding, and rare diseases.

PLEASE NOTE THAT LLMS DO NOT WORK WITHOUT BEING ATTACHED TO THE SPECIFIC SCHEMA AND PROMPTS.
