# Security Code Review Guidelines
# This guideline set emphasizes security best practices and vulnerability prevention.
# Use this for projects handling sensitive data or requiring high security standards.

guidelines:
  # Secret Management
  - label: hardcoded-secrets
    description: Avoid hardcoded secrets, or passwords.

  - label: vcs-secrets
    description: Never commit secrets or credentials to version control. Use environment variables or secure vaults.

  # Input Validation & Injection Prevention
  - label: input-validation
    description: Always validate and sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks, including LDAP, XML, and other injection types not covered by specific guidelines.

  - label: sql-injection
    description: Use parameterized queries or ORM methods to prevent SQL injection. Never concatenate user input into queries.

  - label: command-injection
    description: Validate and sanitize input before using in shell commands to prevent command injection.

  - label: xss-prevention
    description: Escape or sanitize user-generated content before rendering in HTML to prevent XSS attacks.

  # Authentication & Authorization
  - label: authentication
    description: Implement proper authentication checks before granting access to protected resources.

  - label: authorization
    description: Verify authorization for every operation. Never rely solely on client-side checks.

  - label: session-management
    description: Use secure session management with proper timeout and invalidation mechanisms.

  # Cryptography
  - label: strong-crypto
    description: Use strong, modern cryptographic algorithms. Avoid MD5, SHA1, DES, and other deprecated algorithms.

  - label: no-custom-crypto
    description: Never implement custom cryptographic algorithms. Use well-tested libraries.

  - label: password-hashing
    description: Store passwords using strong hashing algorithms with salt (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2).

  # Data Protection
  - label: data-encryption
    description: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption.

  - label: error-info-leaks
    description: Implement proper error handling that does not leak sensitive information or system details.
