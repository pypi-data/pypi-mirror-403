This module adds additional field "Description Customer" which is used
for customer timesheet reports. It also shows the "Description Customer"
instead of the "Description" field in the customer portal. By default
this field will be populated from the "Description" field of the
timesheet.

New report "Timesheet Customer" is added to print timesheets with
"Customer Description" instead of the "Description" field.

Use Cases / Context
===================

Sometimes you might need to add different description for customer
timesheets while keeping the original description for internal use. Eg
your team records timesheets in English but your customer prefers to see
timesheets in French.

Configuration
=============

No configuration is required.

Usage
=====

New field "Description Customer" is added to the timesheet list and form
views. This field is visible only for "Timesheets/Administrator" group.
If this field is not set, the "Description" field value will be
automatically copied to it.

To print report with "Description Customer" instead of "Description"
field:

1. Select timesheets you want to print
2. Click "Print / Timesheets Customer"
