Each interface is separately versioned. &lt;p&gt; **Notes on Naming** &lt;p&gt; All of the reference items are suffixed with \\&quot;Model\\&quot;. Those names are used as the class names in the generated Java code. It is helpful to distinguish these model classes from other related classes, like the DAO classes and the operation classes. &lt;/details&gt;   # noqa: E501
