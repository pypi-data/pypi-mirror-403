# GistFlow

A tiny Python library + CLI for syncing small JSON state via a GitHub Gist.

`gistflow` is useful when you want a cheap, globally reachable state blob over HTTPS
without running your own server. Reads are efficient using HTTP ETags
(`If-None-Match`), so polling is lightweight.

This project intentionally keeps scope small and explicit.
