# MLIR-Based MQT Core / Catalyst Plugin

This package provides a [Catalyst](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst) plugin based on [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/).
It allows you to use [MQT Core](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core)'s MLIR dialects and transformations within Xanadu's [Catalyst](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst) framework.

If you have any questions, feel free to create a [discussion](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core-plugins-catalyst/discussions) or an [issue](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core-plugins-catalyst/issues) on [GitHub](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core-plugins-catalyst).

## Getting Started

`mqt-core-plugins-catalyst` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.core.plugins.catalyst/).

Because `pennylane-catalyst` pins to a specific LLVM/MLIR revision, you must build that LLVM/MLIR locally and point CMake at it.

### 1) Build the exact LLVM/MLIR revision (locally)

If you want to use a _fast_ pre-built MLIR installation locally (recommended), we provide installation scripts. The scripts require a specific LLVM hash (i.e., 113f01aa82d055410f22a9d03b3468fa68600589) and the desired installation directory to be passed. The scripts automatically download and use a platform-specific zstd binary for decompression, so only tar needs to be installed on the host system.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://github.com/munich-quantum-software/setup-mlir/releases/latest/download/setup-mlir.sh | bash -s -- -v 113f01aa82d055410f22a9d03b3468fa68600589 -p /path/to/installation

# Export this for your shell/session
export MLIR_DIR="/path/to/installation/lib/cmake/mlir"
```

Alternatively (but much more time-consuming); you can build MLIR from source as follows:

```bash
# Pick a workspace (optional)
mkdir -p ~/dev && cd ~/dev

# Clone the exact LLVM revision Catalyst expects
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project
git checkout 113f01aa82d055410f22a9d03b3468fa68600589

# Configure & build MLIR (Release is recommended)
cmake -S llvm -B build_llvm -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET=default \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=mlir \
  -DLLVM_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF \
  -DLLVM_BUILD_TESTS=OFF \
  -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF \
  -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=OFF \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_ZLIB=FORCE_ON \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_ZSTD=OFF \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON \
  -DLLVM_ENABLE_EH=ON

cmake --build build_llvm --config Release

# Export this for your shell/session
export MLIR_DIR="$PWD/build_llvm/lib/cmake/mlir"
```

### 2) Install the plugin

Install the MQT Core Catalyst Plugin using `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install mqt-core-plugins-catalyst
```

Alternatively, you can build and install the plugin from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core-plugins-catalyst.git
cd core-plugins-catalyst

# Build and install the plugin
# This automatically creates a venv, downloads Python if necessary, and installs the project
MLIR_DIR="$MLIR_DIR" uv sync

# Or, if the environment variables are already set from step 1:
uv sync
```

### 3) Use the MQT plugin and explore intermediate MLIR representations

The MQT plugin provides device configuration utilities to prevent Catalyst from decomposing gates into unitary matrices, enabling lossless roundtrip conversions.

You can inspect the intermediate MLIR representations during the roundtrip between `CatalystQuantum` and `MQTOpt` dialects.

#### Example: Create a test script

Create a file `test_example.py`:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any

import pennylane as qml
from catalyst.passes import apply_pass
from mqt.core.plugins.catalyst import get_device

# Use get_device() to configure the device for MQT plugin compatibility
device = get_device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)


# Define your quantum circuit
@apply_pass("mqt.mqtopt-to-catalystquantum")
@apply_pass("mqt.catalystquantum-to-mqtopt")
@qml.qnode(device)
def circuit() -> None:
    qml.Hadamard(wires=0)
    qml.CNOT(wires=[0, 1])


# Custom pipeline to capture intermediate MLIR
custom_pipeline = [
    ("Init", ["builtin.module(canonicalize)"]),  # Initial Catalyst MLIR
    ("ToMQTOpt", ["builtin.module(catalystquantum-to-mqtopt)"]),
    ("ToCatalystQuantum", ["builtin.module(mqtopt-to-catalystquantum)"]),
]


# JIT compilation with intermediate MLIR files saved
@qml.qjit(target="mlir", autograph=True, keep_intermediate=2, pipelines=custom_pipeline)
def module() -> Any:
    return circuit()


# Trigger compilation and optimized MLIR generation
module.mlir_opt

# Catalyst writes intermediate MLIR files to the current working directory
mlir_dir = Path.cwd()
mlir_init = mlir_dir / "1_AfterInit.mlir"
mlir_to_mqtopt = mlir_dir / "2_AfterToMQTOpt.mlir"
mlir_to_catalyst = mlir_dir / "3_AfterToCatalystQuantum.mlir"

# Read MLIR files
print("=== Initial Catalyst MLIR ===")
if mlir_init.exists():
    print(mlir_init.read_text())

print("\n=== After CatalystQuantum → MQTOpt conversion ===")
if mlir_to_mqtopt.exists():
    print(mlir_to_mqtopt.read_text())

print("\n=== After MQTOpt → CatalystQuantum roundtrip ===")
if mlir_to_catalyst.exists():
    print(mlir_to_catalyst.read_text())
```

**Alternative:** You can also configure an existing device:

```python
from mqt.core.plugins.catalyst import configure_device_for_mqt

device = qml.device("lightning.qubit", wires=2)
device = configure_device_for_mqt(device)
```

#### Run the example

```bash
uv run test_example.py
```

You should see three MLIR representations showing the transformation through the MQT dialects and back.

#### Verify the installation

You can run the test suite to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Run pytest using uv
uv run pytest test -v
```

```bash
# Alternatively run the tests using nox (handles all dependencies automatically)
uvx nox -s tests
```

## System Requirements

Building the MQT Core Catalyst Plugin requires a C++ compiler with support for C++20 and CMake 3.24 or newer.
Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux and macOS using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
The MQT Core Catalyst Plugin is compatible with Python version 3.11 and newer.

The MQT Core Catalyst Plugin relies on some external dependencies:

- [llvm/llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project): A toolkit for the construction of highly optimized compilers, optimizers, and run-time environments (specific revision: `113f01aa82d055410f22a9d03b3468fa68600589`).
- [PennyLaneAI/catalyst](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/catalyst): A package that enables just-in-time (JIT) compilation of hybrid quantum-classical programs implemented with PennyLane (version == 0.14.0).
- [MQT Core](https://github.com/munich-quantum-toolkit/core): Provides the MQTOpt MLIR dialect and supporting infrastructure.

Note, both LLVM/MLIR and Catalyst are currently restricted to specific versions. You must build LLVM/MLIR locally from the exact revision specified above and configure CMake to use it (see installation instructions).
