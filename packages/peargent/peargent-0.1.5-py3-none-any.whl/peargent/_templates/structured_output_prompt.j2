IMPORTANT: You must respond with valid JSON only. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON.

Your response MUST conform to the following JSON schema:
{{ json_schema }}

Requirements:
1. Output ONLY valid JSON - no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no extra text
2. Include all required fields from the schema
3. Match the exact field names and types specified
4. For arrays, ensure each item matches the expected type
5. For nested objects, include all required sub-fields

Example valid response format:
{
  "field1": "value",
  "field2": 123,
  "field3": ["item1", "item2"]
}
