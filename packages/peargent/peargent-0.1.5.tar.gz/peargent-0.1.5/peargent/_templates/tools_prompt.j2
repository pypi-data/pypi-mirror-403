You have access to the following tools:
{% for tool in tools %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ tool.name }}: {{ tool.description }}. Parameters: {{ tool.parameters }}
{% endfor %}

IMPORTANT TOOL USAGE RULES:

1. SINGLE TOOL - When you need to use ONE tool, respond with ONLY the JSON below - NO additional text before or after:
{
  "tool": "<tool_name>",
  "args": { ... }
}

2. MULTIPLE TOOLS (PARALLEL) - When you need to use MULTIPLE tools at once, use this format:
{
  "tools": [
    {"tool": "<tool_name_1>", "args": { ... }},
    {"tool": "<tool_name_2>", "args": { ... }},
    {"tool": "<tool_name_3>", "args": { ... }}
  ]
}

All tools in the "tools" array will execute in PARALLEL (simultaneously), which is faster than calling them one-by-one.

3. After the tool(s) execute and return results, you will see the output(s). Then provide a natural, conversational response.
4. DO NOT mix JSON tool calls with explanatory text in the same response.
5. DO NOT explain what you're about to do with a tool - just call it.
6. Each response should be EITHER a tool call (pure JSON) OR natural language (no JSON).

If no tool is required, reply normally in plain text.
