# Tactic Mode

Tactic mode in LeanInteract allows working with Lean's proof tactics step-by-step, providing an interactive way to develop and explore proofs.

!!! warning "Experimental Feature"
    The tactic mode feature is experimental may not work as expected in all situations. Some valid proofs might be incorrectly rejected.

## Getting Started with Tactics

Using tactics in LeanInteract involves two main steps:

1. Creating a proof state using `sorry` in a theorem
2. Applying tactics to this proof state using [`ProofStep`](../api/interface.md#lean_interact.interface.ProofStep)

### Creating a Proof State

First, let's create a proof state by defining a theorem with `sorry`:

```python exec="on" source="above" session="tactic" result="python"
from lean_interact import LeanREPLConfig, LeanServer, Command

server = LeanServer(LeanREPLConfig())

# Define a theorem with sorry
response = server.run(Command(cmd="theorem ex (n : Nat) : n = 5 → n = 5 := by sorry"))
print(response.sorries[0])
```

This response contains a [`Sorry`](../api/interface.md#lean_interact.interface.Sorry) object that includes:

- A [`proof_state`](../api/interface.md#lean_interact.interface.Sorry.proof_state) ID for use with tactic commands
- The current goal that needs to be proven

### Applying Tactics

Once a proof state is available, apply tactics using the [`ProofStep`](../api/interface.md#lean_interact.interface.ProofStep) class:

```python exec="on" source="above" session="tactic" result="python"
from lean_interact import ProofStep

# Define a theorem with sorry
theorem_response = server.run(Command(cmd="theorem ex (n : Nat) : n = 5 → n = 5 := sorry"))
proof_state_id = theorem_response.sorries[0].proof_state

# Apply a single tactic (intro) to the proof state
print(server.run(ProofStep(tactic="intro h", proof_state=proof_state_id)))
```

The response contains:

- A new proof state ID ([`proof_state`](../api/interface.md#lean_interact.interface.ProofStepResponse.proof_state)) for chaining additional tactics
- The current goal(s)
- The proof status ([`proof_status`](../api/interface.md#lean_interact.interface.ProofStepResponse.proof_status)) (complete or incomplete)

### Chaining Tactics

Chain multiple tactics by using the proof state from each response:

```python exec="on" source="above" session="tactic" result="python"
from lean_interact import ProofStep

# Define a theorem with sorry
theorem_response = server.run(Command(cmd="theorem ex (n : Nat) : n = 5 → n = 5 := sorry"))
proof_state_id = theorem_response.sorries[0].proof_state

# Apply 'intro' tactic
intro_response = server.run(ProofStep(tactic="intro h", proof_state=proof_state_id))

# Apply 'exact' tactic to the resulting proof state
print(server.run(ProofStep(tactic="exact h", proof_state=intro_response.proof_state)))
```

### Applying Multiple Tactics at Once

Apply multiple tactics at once by wrapping them in parentheses:

```python exec="on" source="above" session="tactic" result="python"
# Apply multiple tactics at once
multi_response = server.run(ProofStep(tactic="""(
intro h
exact h
)""", proof_state=proof_state_id))
print(multi_response)
```

## Complete Proof Session

The [`ProofStepResponse`](../api/interface.md#lean_interact.interface.ProofStepResponse) contains a [`proof_status`](../api/interface.md#lean_interact.interface.ProofStepResponse.proof_status) field that indicates whether the proof is complete.
Here's a complete example of working with tactics:

```python exec="on" source="above" session="tactic" result="python"
# Create a theorem with sorry
theorem_response = server.run(Command(cmd="theorem my_theorem (x : Nat) : x = x := sorry"))
print("Initial goal:", theorem_response.sorries[0].goal)

# Get the proof state from the sorry
proof_state_id = theorem_response.sorries[0].proof_state

# Apply reflexivity tactic
final_response = server.run(ProofStep(tactic="rfl", proof_state=proof_state_id))

# Check if the proof is complete
if final_response.proof_status == "Completed":
    print("Proof completed successfully!")
else:
    print("Proof failed:", final_response)
```
