# About qblox-scheduler

`qblox-scheduler` is a Python module for writing quantum programs featuring a hybrid gate-pulse control model with explicit timing control.
This control model allows quantum gate and pulse-level descriptions to be combined in a clearly defined and hardware-agnostic way.
`qblox-scheduler` is designed to allow experimentalists to easily define complex experiments. It produces synchronized pulse schedules
that are distributed to control hardware, after compiling these schedules into control-hardware specific executable programs.
