A high-performance Python library for sparse Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and Spectral Graph Wavelet Transforms (SGWT). This package leverages the ``CHOLMOD`` library for efficient sparse direct solvers, providing significant speedups over traditional dense or iterative methods for large-scale graph convolution.

Some of the key features include:


- **High-Performance Sparse Solvers**: Direct integration with the ``CHOLMOD`` library for optimized sparse Cholesky factorizations and linear system solves.
- **Generalized Graph Convolution**: Support for arbitrary spectral kernels via rational approximation (Kernel Fitting), polynomial approximation (Chebyshev), and standard analytical filters (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass).
- **Dynamic Topology Support**: Specialized routines for graphs with evolving structures, utilizing efficient rank-1 updates for real-time topology changes.
- **Resource-Aware Execution**: Context-managed memory allocation and workspace reuse to minimize overhead in high-throughput applications.
- **Integrated Graph Repository**: Built-in access to standardized graph Laplacians and signals from power systems and infrastructure networks.

For detailed usage, API reference, and theoretical background, please visit the `documentation website <https://sgwt.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Installation
------------

The ``sgwt`` package requires Python 3.7+ and is currently only compatible with **Windows** operating systems due to its reliance on a pre-compiled ``CHOLMOD`` library.

Install the latest stable release from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/sgwt/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sgwt

This command will also install the necessary dependencies (e.g., NumPy, SciPy).

Basic Example
-------------

Here is a quick example using a band-pass filter to an impulse signal on the synthetic Texas grid to get the wavelet function at three different scales.


.. code-block:: python

    import sgwt

    # Graph Laplacian
    L = sgwt.DELAY_TEXAS

    # Impulse at 600th Vertex
    X = sgwt.impulse(L, n=600)

    with sgwt.Convolve(L) as conv:
        
        # Wavelet at 3 scales
        Y = conv.bandpass(X, scales=[0.1, 1, 10])


The `examples/ <https://github.com/lukelowry/sgwt/tree/main/examples>`_ directory contains a comprehensive suite of demonstrations, also rendered in the `Examples <https://sgwt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/static.html>`_ section of the documentation. Key applications include:

- **Static Filtering**: Basic low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass filtering on various graph sizes.
- **Dynamic Graphs**: Real-time topology updates, performance comparisons, and online stream processing.
