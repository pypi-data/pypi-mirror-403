class Runner(PlugIn, Generic[T]):
    """
    Execution backend for Tiozin pipelines.

    A Runner defines the execution engine (e.g., Spark, Flink, DuckDB) and manages
    the lifecycle of job execution: environment setup, pipeline processing, and
    resource cleanup.

    The Runner does not own its own context. Instead, it receives the context from
    whoever invokes it—typically a Job or a Step. This design keeps the Runner
    stateless and reusable across different execution scopes.

    Lifecycle:
        1. setup(job_context): Called once when the Job initializes the Runner.
           Use this to create sessions, connections, or shared resources.

        2. run(context, plan): Called to execute work. May be invoked:
           - Lazily by the Job with a Context (after all steps complete)
           - Eagerly by each Step with a Context (as steps execute)

        3. teardown(job_context): Called once when the Job releases the Runner.
           Use this to close sessions and release resources.

    Usage:
        with runner(job_context) as runner:
            # Steps may call runner.run(step_context, ...) eagerly
            for step in steps:
                step.execute(runner)
            # Or Job calls runner.run(job_context, ...) lazily at the end
            runner.run(job_context, accumulated_plan)

    Attributes:
        streaming: Indicates whether this runner executes streaming workloads.
        options: Provider-specific configuration parameters.
