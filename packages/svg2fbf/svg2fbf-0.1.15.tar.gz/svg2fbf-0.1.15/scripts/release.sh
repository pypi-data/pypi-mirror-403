release.sh - multi-channel uv + git-cliff + GitHub + PyPI release helper

USAGE:
  ./release.sh [OPTIONS]

CHANNEL OPTIONS (each maps a release channel to a branch name):

  --stable <branch>   Build & release from this branch as a STABLE release.
                      - Uses `uv version --bump` to move to the next stable version.
                      - Regenerates CHANGELOG.md using git-cliff.
                      - Builds wheels/sdist with `uv build`.
                      - Creates a Git tag "v<version>" and a GitHub Release.
                      - Uses git-cliff output as GitHub release notes.
                      - Publishes the release to PyPI with `uv publish`.

  --alpha  <branch>   Build & release from this branch as an ALPHA pre-release.
                      - Uses `uv version --bump` to manage "aN" pre-releases.
                      - Regenerates CHANGELOG.md using git-cliff.
                      - Creates a Git tag "v<version>" and a GitHub pre-release.
                      - Uses git-cliff output as GitHub release notes.
                      - Does NOT publish to PyPI.

  --beta   <branch>   Build & release from this branch as a BETA pre-release.
                      - Uses `uv version --bump` to manage "bN" pre-releases.
                      - Regenerates CHANGELOG.md using git-cliff.
                      - Creates a GitHub pre-release only (no PyPI publish).

  --rc     <branch>   Build & release from this branch as a RELEASE CANDIDATE.
                      - Uses `uv version --bump` to manage "rcN" pre-releases.
                      - Regenerates CHANGELOG.md using git-cliff.
                      - Creates a GitHub pre-release only (no PyPI publish).

GENERAL OPTIONS:

  --no-pypi           Skip PyPI publishing for stable releases. Creates GitHub release
                      only, without running `uv publish`. This flag only affects stable
                      channel releases; alpha/beta/rc never publish to PyPI.

  -h, --help          Show this help text and exit.

CHANGELOG EXPECTATIONS:

  • Expect a changelog file named CHANGELOG.md in the repository.
  • Use git-cliff to generate and regenerate this changelog automatically.
  • CHANGELOG.md is fully regenerated from git history on each release; manual edits
    to this file will be overwritten by git-cliff runs.
  • Typical setup:
        git cliff --init
        git cliff -o CHANGELOG.md
    Configure the behavior in cliff.toml to match your preferred style.

BEHAVIOR SUMMARY:

  • You can specify one or more channels in a single run:
      ./release.sh --alpha dev --beta testing --rc review --stable master

    The script will process them in this fixed order:
      alpha → beta → rc → stable

  • For each channel, the script:
      1. Checks out the configured branch.
      2. Ensures the branch is up to date with origin/<branch>.
      3. Ensures the working tree is clean.
      4. Reads the current version from `uv version`.
      5. Computes bump arguments for `uv version --bump`:
         - alpha:
             - if already "aN", bump alpha;
             - else bump patch + alpha.
         - beta:
             - if already "bN", bump beta;
             - else bump patch + beta.
         - rc:
             - if already "rcN", bump rc;
             - else bump patch + rc.
         - stable:
             - if current is pre-release (a/b/rc), use --bump stable;
             - otherwise bump patch for a new stable version.
      6. Runs `uv version --no-sync` with those arguments.
      7. Uses `git cliff --tag <version> -o CHANGELOG.md` to regenerate the changelog.
      8. Uses `git cliff --tag <version> --latest -o .release-notes-<version>.md`
         to generate release notes for just the latest version section.
      9. Commits pyproject.toml and CHANGELOG.md.
     10. Removes dist/, then runs `uv sync` and `uv build`.
     11. Creates and pushes tag "v<version>".
     12. Creates a GitHub Release (pre-release for alpha/beta/rc).
     13. For stable only: runs `uv publish` to upload to PyPI.

REQUIREMENTS:

  • uv:
      Must be installed and on PATH.
      Used for version bumping, syncing, building, and publishing.

  • gh:
      GitHub CLI must be installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`).

  • git cliff:
      Must be callable as `git cliff`.
      Used to generate CHANGELOG.md and per-release notes.
      Configure via cliff.toml as needed.

  • UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN:
      Required when a stable release is requested so uv can publish to PyPI.
      Example:
        export UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN="pypi-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
