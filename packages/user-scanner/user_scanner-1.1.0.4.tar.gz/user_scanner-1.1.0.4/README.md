A powerful *Email OSINT tool* that checks if a specific email is registered on various sites, combined with *username scanning* for branding or OSINT — 2-in-1 tool.  

Perfect for fast, accurate and lightweight email OSINT

Perfect for finding a **unique username** across GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and more, all in a single command.  

## Features

- ✅ Check an email across multiple sites to see if it’s registered.  
- ✅ Scan usernames across **social networks**, **developer platforms**, **creator communities**, and more.  
- ✅ Can be used purely as a username tool.  
- ✅ Smart auto-update system detects new releases on PyPI and prompts the user to upgrade interactively.  
- ✅ Clear `Registered` and `Not Registered` for email scanning `Available` / `Taken` / `Error` output for username scans
- ✅ Robust error handling: displays the exact reason a username or email cannot be used (e.g., underscores or hyphens at the start/end).  
- ✅ Fully modular: easily add new platform modules.  
- ✅ Wildcard-based username permutations for automatic variation generation using a provided suffix.  
- ✅ Option to select results format (**JSON**, **CSV**, console).  
- ✅ Save scanning and OSINT results in the preferred format and output file (ideal for power users).  
- ✅ Command-line interface ready: works immediately after `pip install`.  
- ✅ Lightweight with minimal dependencies; runs on any machine.
- ✅ **Proxy support** with round-robin rotation
- ✅ **Proxy validation** to test and filter working proxies before scanning
- ✅ **Bulk username scanning** from file support for checking multiple usernames at once
- ✅ **Bulk email scanning** from file support for checking multiple emails at once

## Usage

### Basic username/email scan

Scan a single username across **all** available modules/platforms:

```bash
user-scanner -e john_doe@gmail.com
user-scanner --email john_doe@gmail.com # long version

user-scanner -u john_doe
user-scanner --username john_doe # long version
```

### Selective scanning

Scan only specific categories or single modules:

```bash
user-scanner -u john_doe -c dev # developer platforms only
user-scanner -u john_doe -m github # only GitHub
```

### Bulk username scanning

Scan multiple usernames from a file (one username per line):
- Can also be combined with categories or modules using `-c` and `-m` flags

```bash
user-scanner -uf usernames.txt
```


### Bulk email scanning

Scan multiple emails from a file (one email per line):
- Can also be combined with categories or modules using `-c` and `-m` flags

```bash
user-scanner -ef emails.txt
```

### Username/Email variations (suffix only)

Generate & check username variations using a permutation from the given suffix:

```bash
user-scanner -u john_ -p ab # john_a, ..., john_ab, john_ba
```

### Using Proxies

Route requests through proxy servers:

```bash
user-scanner -u john_doe -P proxies.txt
```

Validate proxies before scanning (tests each proxy against google.com):

```bash
user-scanner -u john_doe -P proxies.txt --validate-proxies # recommended
```

This will:
1. Test all proxies from the file
2. Filter out non-working proxies
3. Save working proxies to `validated_proxies.txt`
4. Use only validated proxies for scanning

---

### Update

Update the tool to the latest PyPI version:

```bash
user-scanner -U
```

**Module guidelines:**
This project contains small "validator" modules that check whether a username exists on a given platform. Each validator is a single function that returns a Result object (see `core/orchestrator.py`).

Result semantics:
- Result.available() → `available`
- Result.taken() → `taken`
- Result.error(message: Optional[str]) → `error`, blocked, unknown, or request failure (include short diagnostic message when helpful)

Follow this document when adding or updating validators.
