The `application_properties` package was born out of necessity.
During the creation of the [PyMarkdown](https://github.com/jackdewinter/pymarkdown) project,
there was a distinct need for a configuration subsystem that was able to handle more
complex configuration scenarios.

The `application_properties` library has the following advantages:

- Thoroughly tested
  - The project currently has over 65 tests and coverage percentages over 99%.
- Simple... With Examples
  - The package was created with the intention of being as easy to use as possbile.
  - To that extent, there are 4 basic usage examples and over 10 advanced usage examples.
- Complex When Required
  - The default is simplicity, but the package can step up when required to do so.
  - Any actions outside of the simple scenario of getting an optional string value should
    be relatively easy to request of the package API.
- Hierarchically Aware
  - By default, uses the `.` character in the property names to define levels of hierarchy.
  - Hierarchy levels can be used to find only those properties that exist under a
    given hierarchy.
  - If desired, the `ApplicationPropertiesFacade` object can be used to restrict access
    to only those properties that exist under a given hierarchy.
- Command Line Aware
  - The `set_manual_property` function allows for one or more individual properties to be
    supplied by the command line.
- Extensible
  - The loading of the properties is separate from access to the values for those properties.
  - Due to the separation of the loading and accessing parts of the library, custom loading
    classes can be added with ease.
    - Current loading classes include loaders for Json files, with Simple Property files right
      around the corner
