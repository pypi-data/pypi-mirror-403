                This class computes close approach events between a reference trajectory and other object trajectories
                over a specified time interval. It uses a temporal condition solver to identify time periods when objects
                are approaching and then determines the exact time of closest approach.

                                interval where both objects can be moving apart - which is about a quarter of an orbital period. Defaults to
                                Duration.minutes(20.0) - but it should be set lower for low velocity conjunctions as they tend to exhibit more than two

                            tolerance (Duration): The tolerance to use during the close approach search. Defaults to Duration.milliseconds(1.0) - which
                                means that objects moving at 7km/s will be up to 7m away from their “true” position.
