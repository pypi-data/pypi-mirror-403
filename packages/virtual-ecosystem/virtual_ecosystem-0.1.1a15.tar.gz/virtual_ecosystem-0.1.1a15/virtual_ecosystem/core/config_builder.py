"""The :mod:`~virtual_ecosystem.core.config_builder` provides tools to load a set of
TOML formatted configuration dictionaries, either from files or from strings. String
inputs are primarily intended for use in configuring models for testing, where it is
more convenient to simply provide a string.

The main class :class:`ConfigurationLoader` handles the loading of configuration data
and compiling multiple sources into a single dictionary of configuration data.

The :func:`generate_configuration` function then:

* takes a compiled dictionary of configuration settings,
* assembles a pydantic validation model class using the configuration validators for
  each of the requested science modules, and
* passes the data through the validator to return a validated configuration model for
  the simulation.

Canonical usage patterns for the module would be:

.. code-block:: python

    config_data = ConfigurationLoader(...)
    config_object = generate_configuration(config_data.data)

    """Recursively merge two configuration dictionaries.

    This function returns a copy of the input ``dest`` dictionary that has been extended
    recursively with the entries from the input ``source`` dictionary.

    The merging process looks for duplicated settings. In general, if two input
    dictionaries share complete key paths (that is a set of nested dictionary keys
    leading to a value) then that indicates a duplicated setting. The values might be
    identical, but the configuration files should not duplicate settings. When
    duplicated key paths are found, the value from the source dictionary is used and the
    function extends the returned ``conflicts`` set with the duplicated key path.

    However an exception is where both entries are lists - for example, resulting from a
    TOML array of tables (https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#array-of-tables). In this case, it
    is reasonable to append the source values to the destination values. The motivating
    example here are `[[core.data.variable]]` entries, which can quite reasonably be
    split across configuration sources. Note that no attempt is made to check that the
    combined values are congruent - this is deferred to error handling when the
    configuration data is loaded.

class ConfigurationLoader:
    """Configuration loading.

    The ``ConfigurationLoader`` class is used to load and compile configuration data for
    a Virtual Ecosystem simulation. Configuration data can be passed in as one of:

    * a list of paths to individual TOML configuration files or directories of TOML
      files  (the ``cfg_paths`` argument) or
    * a list of TOML strings providing configuration data (the ``cfg_strings``
      argument).

    In both cases, there is initial input validation of the argument values and then two
    data handling steps are run.

    Data loading
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The :meth:`_load_data` method handles the parsing of the TOML inputs. For
    configuration data passed as strings, this is largely checking that the data is
    valid TOML.

    For configuration data passed as paths, the following steps occur:

    * The :meth:`_collect_config_paths` method is used to compile a complete list of the
      individual TOML files to be used to build the configuration from the provided
      paths.

    * The :meth:`_load_config_toml` method is then
      used to parse the TOML content of each file, verifying that is valid TOML, and
      then store the parsed contents.

    * The :meth:`_resolve_config_file_paths` method is then used to to update file paths
      in configuration inputs to resolve them to absolute file paths. This is so that
      the file paths in the final compiled configuration data are all mutually
      resolvable, as the input files may use relative paths and do not necessarily all
      live in the same directory.

    At the end of this step, the :attr:`toml_contents` attribute will have been
    populated with individual parsed dictionaries of configuration data from each file
    or input string.

    Data compilation
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The :meth:`_compile_data` method is then run to compile the different individual
    dictionaries into a single configuration document. This method checks that
    configuration settings are uniquely set across the various configuration data
    sources. The :attr:`data` attribute then contains the complete compiled set of
    configuration data from the provided sources.

        cfg_paths: A string, Path or list of strings or Paths giving configuration
            file or directory paths.

            data.

    This method takes a dictionary of configuration data and tries to build a validated
    configuration model. The input data is typically loaded and compiled using the

    The first step is to take the root sections in the configuration data - indicating
    the various science models requested for a simulation - and uses those to build a
    composite configuration validator class.

    The provided data is then passed into the validator. If validation is successful
    then a validated configuration object is returned, otherwise the specific validation
    errors are written to the log and the function raises a :class`ConfigurationError`
