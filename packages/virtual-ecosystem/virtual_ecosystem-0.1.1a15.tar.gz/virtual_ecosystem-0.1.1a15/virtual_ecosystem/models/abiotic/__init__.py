r"""The :mod:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.abiotic` module is one of the component
models of the Virtual Ecosystem. It is comprised of several submodules that calculate
the microclimate for the Virtual Ecosystem.

Each of the abiotic sub-modules has its own API reference page:

* The :mod:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.abiotic.abiotic_model` submodule
  instantiates the AbioticModel class which consolidates the functionality of the
  abiotic model into a single class, which the high level functions of the
  Virtual Ecosystem can then use.

* The :mod:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.abiotic.model_config` submodule provides
  configuration settings for the model and a set of constants required by the model.

* The :mod:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.abiotic.abiotic_tools` submodule contains a set
  of general functions that are shared across submodules in the
  :mod:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.abiotic` model.

* The :mod:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.abiotic.wind` submodule calculates the
  above- and within-canopy wind profiles for the Virtual Ecosystem. These profiles will
  determine the exchange of heat, water, and :math:`\ce{CO_{2}}` between soil and
  atmosphere below the canopy as well as the exchange with the atmsophere above the
  canopy.

* The :mod:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.abiotic.energy_balance` submodule calculates the
  energy balance of the Virtual Ecosystem. The module returns vertical profiles of air
  temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit, and soil temperature as well
  as the partitioned energy and radiation fluxes at the leaf and soil surface.

* The :mod:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.abiotic.microclimate` submodule integrates all
  processes and returns vertical profiles of air temperature, relative humidity, vapour
  pressure deficit, soil temperature, and wind speed as well as the partitioned energy
  fluxes. The model also provides vertical profiles of atmospheric pressure and
  :math:`\ce{CO_{2}}`.
