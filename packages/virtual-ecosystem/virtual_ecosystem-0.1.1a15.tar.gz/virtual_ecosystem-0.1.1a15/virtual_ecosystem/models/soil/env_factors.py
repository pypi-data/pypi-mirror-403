    This functions calculates the rate at which soil water in the microbially active
    region is refreshed with "new" water from rainfall. The reason to specifically care
    about "new" water is that it does not carry any significant amount of nutrients with
    it (in contrast to water moving from a different part of the soil), meaning that the
    soil nutrients will dissolve from the soil without impediment (which is the
    assumption underlying the
    :func:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.soil.env_factors.calculate_solute_removal_by_soil_water`
    function). The rate of "new" water refreshing the microbially active column will be
    equivalent to the rate at which water escapes from this region. For the upper soil
    layers, all water flows are vertical rather than horizontal, so this function only
    considers vertical flows. If the implementation of the hydrology model changes so
    that the upper layers also have horizontal water movements this function will need
    to change to ensure that nutrient flows properly track the water flows.

    The water column that the soil model is interested in (i.e. the amount of water down
    to the maximum depth of microbial activity) generally spans a fractional number of
    soil hydrology layers, meaning that water exits the microbially active region within
    a specific soil hydrology layer rather than at the boundary of two layers. This
    complicates things as the vertical flow rates are defined for passing between
    hydrology layers. We therefore calculate two separate exit rates which we then sum
    to find the combined rate. Firstly, we calculate the rate at which water flows into
    the microbially inactive portion of the partially microbially active layer. This is
    found by multiplying the vertical flow into the layer by the fraction of the layer
    that is microbially inactive. Secondly, we calculate the rate at which water flows
    from the microbially active portion of this layer to the microbially inactive layer
    below. This flow is found by multiplying the vertical flow to the lower layer by the
