# Welcome to the Virtual Ecosystem

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ImperialCollegeLondon/virtual_rainforest/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/ImperialCollegeLondon/virtual_rainforest)

This repository is the home for the development of the Virtual Ecosystem. The
Virtual Ecosystem is a project to develop a simulation of all of the major
processes involved in a real ecosystem including the:

* growth and demographic processes of the primary producers within the forest,
* microclimatic processes within and around the ecosystem,
* hydrological processes within the canopy, soil and drainage networks,
* biotic and abiotic processes within the soil, and the
* growth and demography of heterotrophs.

## Project details

This project is funded by a 2021 Distinguished Scientist award from the NOMIS
Foundation to Professor Robert Ewers:

## Project Team

The Virtual Ecosystem is being developed by a international team of researchers lead by
Professor Robert Ewers (Imperial College London). For more details, please see the [team
page](https://virtual-ecosystem.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project_team.html) on our website.

The research team are supported by the Imperial College London
[Research Software
Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/research-support/rcs/service-offering/research-software-engineering/)
team.

## Model documentation
