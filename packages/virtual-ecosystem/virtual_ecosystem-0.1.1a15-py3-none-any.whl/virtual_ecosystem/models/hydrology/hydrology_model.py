There are still a number of open TODOs related to process implementation and improvement

.. TODO:: processes

    * spin up soil moisture
    * set boundaries for river discharge
    * update infiltration process

.. TODO:: time step and model structure

    * find a way to load daily (precipitation) data and loop over daily time_index
    * potentially move `calculate_drainage_map` to core
    * add abiotic constants from config

.. TODO:: units and module coordination

    * change temperature to Kelvin

        This function calculates the main hydrological components of the Virtual

        * interception, [mm]
        * canopy_evaporation, [mm]
        * precipitation_surface, [mm]
        * soil_moisture, [mm]
        * matric_potential, [kPa]
        * surface_runoff, [mm]
        * subsurface_flow, [mm]
        * soil_evaporation, [mm]
        * vertical_flow, [mm d-1]
        * groundwater_storage, [mm]
        * subsurface_flow, [mm]
        * baseflow, [mm]
        * surface_runoff_routed_plus_local, [mm]
        * subsurface_runoff_routed_plus_local, [mm]
        * total_runoff, [mm]
        * river_discharge_rate, [m3 s-1]
        * bypass flow, [mm]
        * aerodynamic_resistance_soil, [s m-1]

        Many of the underlying processes are problematic at a monthly timestep, which is
        currently the only supported update interval. As a short-term work around, the
        input precipitation is randomly distributed over 30 days and input canopy
        transpiration is divided by 30, and the return variables
        are monthly means or monthly accumulated values.

        Precipitation that reaches the surface is defined as incoming precipitation
        minus canopy interception, which is estimated using a stroage-based approach,
        see
        :func:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.hydrology.above_ground.calculate_interception`
        . The water from the canopy interception pool either evaporated back to the
        atmosphere or drips through the canopy reaching the surface with a delay.

        Surface runoff is calculated with a simple bucket model based on
        :cite:t:`davis_simple_2017`, see
        :func:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.hydrology.above_ground.calculate_surface_runoff`
        : if precipitation exceeds top soil moisture capacity
        , the excess water is added to runoff and top soil moisture is set to soil
        moisture capacity value; if the top soil is not saturated, precipitation is
        added to the current topsoil moisture level and runoff is set to zero.
        The local contribution of a cell to the river channel is calculated as its own
        surface and subsurface runoff for the current timestep.

        Potential soil evaporation is calculated with classical bulk aerodynamic
        formulation, following the so-called ':math:`\alpha` method', see
        :func:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.hydrology.above_ground.calculate_soil_evaporation`
        , and reduced to actual evaporation as a function of leaf area index.

        Vertical flow between soil layers is calculated combining Richards' equation and
        Darcy's law for unsaturated flow
        :func:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.hydrology.below_ground.calculate_vertical_flow`
        . Here, the mean vertical flow in mm per day that goes though the top soil layer
        is returned to the data object. Note that there are
        severe limitations to this approach on the temporal and spatial scale of this
        model and this can only be treated as a very rough approximation!

        Soil moisture is updated by iteratively updating the soil moisture of individual
        layers under consideration of the vertical flow in and out of each layer, see
        :func:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.hydrology.below_ground.update_soil_moisture`

        Groundwater storage and flows are modelled using two parallel linear
        reservoirs, see
        :func:`~virtual_ecosystem.models.hydrology.below_ground.update_groundwater_storage`
        . The horizontal flow between grid cells currently uses the same function as the
        above ground runoff.

        Total runoff is calculated as the sum of above- and below ground
        runoff and converted to river discharge rate in [m3 s-1].

        The function requires the following input variables from the data object:

        * air temperature, [C]
        * relative humidity, []
        * atmospheric pressure, [kPa]
        * vapour pressure deficit, [kPa]
        * precipitation, [mm]
        * wind speed, [m s-1]
        * leaf area index, [m m-1]
        * layer heights, [m]
        * Soil moisture (previous time step), [mm]
        * transpiration (current time step), [mm]
        * density of air, [kg m-3]
        * specific heat of air, [kJ kg-1 K-1]
        * stomatal conductance, [mol m-2 s-1]
        * aerodynamic resistance canopy, [s m-1]
        * net radiation, [W m-2]
