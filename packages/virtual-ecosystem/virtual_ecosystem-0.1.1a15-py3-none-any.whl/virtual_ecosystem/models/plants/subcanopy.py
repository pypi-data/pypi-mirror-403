"""The subcanopy module provides a representation of subcanopy biomass as two pools. The
first is a pool of subcanopy vegetation, implemented as layer of pure leaf tissue in the
surface layer of the model vertical structure. The second is a pool of subcanopy
seedbank biomass.

Both pools use a simplified stiochiometric system: this is defined independently of the
:mod:`virtual_ecosystem.models.plants.stoichiometry` module, as that class explicitly
handles communities of cohorts with multiple tissue types. The subcanopy has much
simpler structure with two stoichiometric masses per grid cell and so the dynamics are
more easily handled by a separate implementation.

The module implements the following classes:

* The :class:`Nutrient` class provides a representation of nutrient masses per grid
  cell.
* The :class:`SubcanopyBiomass` class then tracks the carbon mass and an associated set
  of nutrient masses for a given pool.
* The :class:`Subcanopy` then maintains subcanopy biomass pools for the vegetation and
  seedbank and provides methods to update the light gathering and ecological dynamics of
  the subcanopy at each update step.

        This method models the biomass dynamics with the subcanopy vegetation and
        subcanopy seedbank pools during a model update.

        1. A fraction of the biomass in each pool is allocated to turnover, and passed
           into litter pools. The stoichiometric ratios of turnover biomass are
           identical to the pool biomasses.

        2. The predicted light use and intrinsic water use efficiencies (LUE and iWUE)
           in the surface layer are taken from the P Model and used to estimate gross
           primary productivity (GPP) and transpiration. GPP is reduced by respiration
           and yield to give net primary productivity NPP, which is added as new carbon
           biomass to the subcanopy vegetation. The soil dissolved nitrate, ammonium and
           phosphorous concentrations are then used to calculate the nutrient uptake
           associated with the transpiration volume and these are added to the subcanopy
           vegetation pool.

        3. A fraction of the subcanopy vegetation biomass is then removed to represent
           reproductive output to the seedbank pool. The stochiometric ratio of the
           reproductive biomass is initially identical to the vegetation biomass but any
           excess nitrogen and phosphorous above the configured ideal ratios is also
           transferred to the seedbank to represent seed provisioning.

        4. Lastly, new vegetative biomass is added from sprouting from the seedbank. The
           initial amount of sprouting biomass is set by the ``subcanopy_sprout_rate``
           constant but the contribution to subcanopy biomass is reduced using the
           ``subcanopy_sprout_yield`` constant. The remainder of the sprouting biomass
           is allocated to litter.
