# mantis-cli

Mantis is a CLI (command line interface) tool designed as a wrapper upon docker and docker compose commands for your project.

Using few commands you can:
- encrypt and decrypt your environment files
- build and push docker images
- create docker contexts
- zero-downtime deploy your application
- print logs of your containers
- connect to bash of your containers using SSH 
- clean docker resources
- use specific commands using Django, PostgreSQL and Nginx extensions
- and much more

## Installation

```bash
pip install mantis-cli
```

## Configuration

Create a **mantis.json** configuration file in JSON format.
You can use ``<MANTIS>`` variable in your paths if needed as a relative reference to your mantis file.

See [template file](https://github.com/PragmaticMates/mantis-cli/blob/master/mantis/mantis.tpl) for exact JSON structure.

### Connections

Mantis supports two connection modes: **multi-environment** and **single connection**.

#### Multi-environment mode

Use `connections` (dict) when you have multiple environments like stage, production, etc.:

```json
"connections": {
    "stage": "context://<context_name>",
    "production": "ssh://<user>@<host>:<port>"
}
```

In this mode, you must specify the environment in every command:

```bash
mantis -e production status
mantis -e stage deploy
```

#### Single connection mode

Use `connection` (string) when you only have one environment. This simplifies the CLI usage by making the environment parameter optional:

```json
"connection": "ssh://<user>@<host>:<port>"
```

In this mode, you can run commands without specifying an environment:

```bash
mantis status
mantis deploy
```

Environment files are looked up directly in the `environment.folder` instead of environment-specific subfolders.

**Note:** You cannot define both `connection` and `connections` in the same config file.

### Encryption

If you plan to use encryption and decryption of your environment files, you need to create encryption key.

Generation of new key:

```bash
mantis generate-key
```

Save key to **mantis.key** file:

```bash
echo <MANTIS_KEY> > /path/to/encryption/folder/mantis.key
```

Then you can encrypt your environment files using symmetric encryption.
Every environment variable is encrypted separately instead of encrypting the whole file for better tracking of changes in VCS.

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> encrypt-env
```

Decryption is easy like this:

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> decrypt-env
```

When decrypting, mantis prompts user for confirmation.
You can bypass that by forcing decryption which can be useful in CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> decrypt-env --force
```

## Usage

General usage of mantis-cli has this format:

```bash
mantis [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]... [+ COMMAND [ARGS]...]
```

Use `+` to chain multiple commands:

```bash
mantis -e production build + push + deploy
```

### Options

| Option          | Description                                       |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| --env, -e       | Environment ID (e.g., stage, production)          |
| --mode, -m      | Execution mode: remote (default), ssh, host       |
| --dry-run, -n   | Show commands without executing                   |
| --version, -v   | Show version and exit                             |
| --help, -h      | Show help message                                 |

### Modes

Mantis can operate in 3 different modes depending on how it connects to remote machine:

#### Remote mode `--mode=remote`

Runs commands remotely from local machine using DOCKER_HOST or DOCKER_CONTEXT (default)

#### SSH mode `--mode=ssh`

Connects to host via SSH and runs all mantis commands on remote machine directly (mantis-cli needs to be installed on server)

#### Host mode `--mode=host`

Runs mantis on host machine directly without invoking connection (used as proxy for ssh mode)

### Environments

Environment can be either *local* or any custom environment like *stage*, *production* etc.
The environment is also used as an identifier for remote connection.

- `--healthy-timeout N`: Wait up to N seconds for the container to become healthy before executing. Polls every second and skips the command if the timeout is reached.

| Command                               | Description                                               |

### Examples

```bash
mantis --version
mantis -e local encrypt-env
mantis -e stage build
mantis -e production logs web

# Run multiple commands using + separator
mantis -e stage build + push + deploy
mantis -e stage build web api + push + deploy + status

# Commands with arguments
mantis -e production deploy --dirty
mantis -e production manage migrate
mantis -e production manage --healthy-timeout 60 migrate
mantis -e production pg-dump --data-only --table users

# Single connection mode (no environment needed)
mantis status
mantis deploy
```

Check `mantis --help` for more details, or `mantis COMMAND --help` for command-specific help.

## Flow

### 1. Build

Once you define mantis config for your project and optionally create encryption key, you can build your docker images:

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> build
```

Mantis either uses `docker-compose --build` or `docker build` command depending on build tool defined in your config.
Build image names use '_' as word separator.

### 2. Push

Built images needs to be pushed to your repository defined in compose file (you need to authenticate)

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> push
```

### 3. Deployment

Deployment to your remote server is being executed by calling simple command:

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> deploy
```

Or chain all steps together:

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> build + push + deploy
```

The deployment process consists of multiple steps:

- If using --mode=ssh, mantis uploads mantis config, environment files and compose file to server
- pulling docker images from repositories
- [zero-downtime deployment](https://github.com/PragmaticMates/mantis-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#zero-downtime-deployment) of running containers (if any)
- calling docker compose up to start containers
- removing numeric suffixes from container names (if scale==1)
- reloading webserver (if found suitable extension)
- cleaning docker resources (without volumes)

Docker container names use '-' as word separator (docker compose v2 convention).

### 4. Inspect

Once deployed, you can verify the container status:

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> status
```

list all docker networks:

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> networks
```

and also check all container logs:

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> logs
```

If you need to follow logs of a specific container, you can do it by passing container name to command:

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> logs <container-name>
```

### 5. Another useful commands

Sometimes, instead of calling whole deployment process, you just need to call compose commands directly:

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> up
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> down
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> restart
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> stop
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> kill
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> start
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> clean
```

Commands over a single container:

```bash
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> bash <container-name>
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> sh <container-name>
mantis -e <ENVIRONMENT> run <params>
```

## Zero-downtime deployment

Mantis has own zero-downtime deployment implementation without any third-party dependencies. 
It uses docker compose service scaling and docker health-checks.

Works as follows:

- a new service container starts using scaling
- mantis waits until the new container is healthy by checking its health status. If not health-check is defined, it waits X seconds defined by start period 
- reloads webserver (to proxy requests to new container)
- once container is healthy or start period ends the old container is stopped and removed
- new container is renamed to previous container's name
- webserver is reloaded again

## Release notes

Mantis uses semantic versioning. See more in [changelog](https://github.com/PragmaticMates/mantis-cli/blob/master/CHANGES.md).
