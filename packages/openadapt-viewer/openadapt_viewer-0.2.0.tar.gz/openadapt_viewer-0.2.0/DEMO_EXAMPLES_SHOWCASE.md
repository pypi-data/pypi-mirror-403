This document shows 5 diverse examples from the synthetic demo library, demonstrating different domains and complexity levels.

---

## Example 1: Simple Task - Open Notepad (7 steps)

**Domain:** notepad
**Complexity:** Easy
**Estimated Steps:** 7

```
TASK: Open Notepad
DOMAIN: notepad

STEPS:
1. Click on the Windows Start button to access the application menu
   REASONING: The Start menu provides access to all installed applications and is the primary entry point for launching Notepad
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)

2. Wait for the Start menu to fully open
   REASONING: The system needs time to render the Start menu interface before we can interact with it
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Type "notepad" in the search box to find the Notepad application
   REASONING: Using search is the quickest and most reliable way to locate Notepad among all installed applications
   ACTION: TYPE("notepad")

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: The system needs time to process the search query and display matching applications
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Click on the Notepad application in the search results
   REASONING: This launches the Notepad application which is displayed as the top search result
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.35)

6. Wait for Notepad window to open
   REASONING: The application needs time to initialize and display its main window interface
   ACTION: WAIT(1.5)

7. Verify Notepad is open and ready for use
   REASONING: Confirming the application has successfully launched ensures the task is complete
   ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: Notepad application window should be open and visible on the screen, displaying a blank text editor with the title "Untitled - Notepad" in the window header, ready for text input.
```

**Key Patterns:**
- Start menu → Search → Launch workflow
- Proper wait times for UI transitions
- Normalized coordinates (0.0-1.0 range)
- Clear reasoning for each step

   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

3. Type "paint" to search for the Paint application
   REASONING: Quickly locate Paint application through Windows search functionality
   ACTION: TYPE("paint")

4. Wait for search results to populate
   REASONING: Give the system time to find and display Paint in the search results
   ACTION: WAIT(1.0)

5. Click on Paint application in search results
   REASONING: Launch the Paint application to access drawing tools
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.10, y=0.25)

6. Wait for Paint application to fully load
   REASONING: Ensure Paint interface is completely loaded and ready for interaction
   ACTION: WAIT(2.0)

7. Click on the Shapes tool in the ribbon menu
   REASONING: Access the shapes gallery to select the rectangle drawing tool
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.08)

8. Select the rectangle shape from the shapes dropdown
   REASONING: Choose the rectangle tool specifically from available shape options
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.13, y=0.12)

9. Position cursor at starting point for rectangle
   REASONING: Prepare to draw the rectangle by clicking at the desired top-left corner position on the canvas
   ACTION: CLICK(x=0.30, y=0.35)

10. Draw the rectangle by dragging to create the shape
    REASONING: Create the rectangle by dragging from the starting point to define its width and height
    ACTION: DRAG(start_x=0.30, start_y=0.35, end_x=0.65, end_y=0.65)

11. Task completion
    REASONING: Rectangle has been successfully drawn on the canvas
    ACTION: DONE()

EXPECTED_OUTCOME: A rectangle should be visible on the Paint canvas, drawn from coordinates (0.30, 0.35) to (0.65, 0.65), displaying a clear rectangular shape with the default outline style and fill settings.
```

**Key Patterns:**
- Application launch + tool selection workflow
- Use of DRAG action for drawing

## Common Action Patterns Across Demos

### 1. Application Launch Pattern
```
CLICK(x=0.02, y=0.98)  # Start menu
WAIT(1.0)
TYPE("app_name")
WAIT(1.0)
CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.35)  # First search result
WAIT(1.5)
```

### 2. Save File Pattern
```
HOTKEY("ctrl", "s")
WAIT(0.5)
TYPE("filename.txt")
CLICK(x=0.7, y=0.9)  # Save button
WAIT(0.5)
```

### 3. Menu Navigation Pattern
```
CLICK(x=0.1, y=0.05)  # Menu bar
WAIT(0.3)
CLICK(x=0.15, y=0.15)  # Menu item
WAIT(0.3)
```

### 4. Form Filling Pattern
```
CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.3)  # Field 1
TYPE("value1")
CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.4)  # Field 2
TYPE("value2")

## Coordinate Convention

All demos use normalized coordinates (0.0 to 1.0):

### Common UI Element Positions

| Element | Typical Coordinate | Notes |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| Start Menu Button | `(0.02, 0.98)` | Bottom-left corner |
| First Search Result | `(0.15, 0.35)` | Upper-left area |
| Center of Screen | `(0.5, 0.5)` | Middle |
| Save/OK Button | `(0.7, 0.8)` or `(0.7, 0.9)` | Bottom-right of dialogs |
| Menu Bar | `y=0.05` to `0.1` | Top of window |
| Canvas Center | `(0.5, 0.5)` | Middle of work area |
| System Tray | `x=0.9+, y=0.98` | Bottom-right corner |

### Resolution Independence

Coordinates are normalized so demos work across different screen resolutions:
- **1920x1080**: `CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.5)` → pixel (960, 540)
- **2560x1440**: `CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.5)` → pixel (1280, 720)
- **3840x2160**: `CLICK(x=0.5, y=0.5)` → pixel (1920, 1080)

## Action Type Distribution

Across all 35 synthetic demos:

| Action Type | Approximate % | Use Case |
|-------------|--------------|----------|
| `CLICK` | 60% | Most common interaction |
| `WAIT` | 20% | UI transition delays |
| `TYPE` | 10% | Text input |
| `DONE` | 5% | Task completion |
| `DRAG` | 3% | Drawing, selecting |
| `HOTKEY` | 1% | Keyboard shortcuts |
| `RIGHT_CLICK` | <1% | Context menus |
| `SCROLL` | <1% | Navigation |

## Use in Prompts

Here's how a demo is actually used in an API call:

```python
system_prompt = f"""
You are a Windows automation agent. Here's an example demonstration:

=== EXAMPLE: {demo.task} ===

{demo.content}

=== END EXAMPLE ===

Now, for the current task, follow the same format.
Provide your next action using the exact syntax shown above.
"""

user_prompt = f"""
Task: {current_task}
Screenshot: [base64 encoded image]

What action should you take next?
"""

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt},
    ]
)
```
