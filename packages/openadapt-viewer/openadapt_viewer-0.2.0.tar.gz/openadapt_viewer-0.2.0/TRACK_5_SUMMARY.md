## Key Achievements

### 1. Canonical Pattern Established

The component-based pattern is now the official way to build viewers:

```python
# Canonical pattern
from openadapt_viewer.builders import PageBuilder
from openadapt_viewer.components import metrics_grid, filter_bar

builder = PageBuilder(title="My Viewer")
builder.add_section(metrics_grid([...]))
builder.add_section(filter_bar([...]))
html = builder.render()
```

### 2. Migration Path Documented

Clear path from inline templates to components:

**Before (inline template):**
- 430+ lines of hard-coded HTML
- Duplicated patterns across viewers
- Hard to maintain and test

**After (component-based):**
- ~200 lines using PageBuilder + components
- Reusable components across viewers
- Easy to maintain and test

**Result:** 53% code reduction, better maintainability.

### 3. Complete Reference Available

Developers now have:
- **VIEWER_PATTERNS.md** - How to build new viewers
- **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - How to convert old viewers
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture
- **README.md** - Quick reference

### 4. Anti-Patterns Documented

Clear guidance on what NOT to do:
- ❌ Inline Jinja2 templates
- ❌ Duplicate JavaScript implementations
- ❌ Hard-coded HTML strings
- ❌ Mixing data loading and HTML generation

### 5. Best Practices Codified

9 best practices documented:
1. Use Pydantic models for data
2. Keep files under 500 lines
3. Document with docstrings
4. Provide sample data
5. Use type hints
6. Follow naming conventions
7. Add tests
8. Include CLI command
9. Update documentation

## Examples Provided

### Complete Working Examples

1. **Benchmark viewer** (data.py + generator.py)
2. **Component usage** (all 22 components)
3. **Common patterns** (catalog, search, playback)
4. **Migration** (before/after comparison)

### Updated
3. `/Users/abrichr/oa/src/openadapt-viewer/ARCHITECTURE.md` (added migration section)
4. `/Users/abrichr/oa/src/openadapt-viewer/README.md` (updated components, viewers, docs)

## Next Steps

The canonical pattern is now documented. Future work:

1. **Apply pattern** - Use VIEWER_PATTERNS.md for new viewers
2. **Migrate viewers** - Use MIGRATION_GUIDE.md to convert inline viewers
3. **Update examples** - Ensure examples follow canonical pattern
4. **Train developers** - Share documentation with team
5. **Iterate** - Update docs based on feedback

## References

- Benchmark viewer refactor (Track 1) - Source of canonical pattern
- Component library - 22 reusable components
- PageBuilder API - Fluent API for building pages
- Examples - Reference implementations

## Conclusion

Track 5 successfully documented the canonical viewer pattern that emerged from refactoring work. The documentation provides:

✅ Clear guidance for new viewers (VIEWER_PATTERNS.md)
✅ Migration path for old viewers (MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
✅ Updated architecture docs (ARCHITECTURE.md)
✅ Updated quick reference (README.md)

**Total:** 1,408 lines of comprehensive documentation covering every aspect of viewer development.

The pattern is now the official approach for all new viewers in openadapt-viewer.
