## 23 Repositories to Archive (IMMEDIATE ACTION)

### Category A: Research Forks (17 repos - Archive in Phase 1)

These are forks of external research projects with zero modifications and minimal engagement:

1. whisper
2. ultralytics
3. grok-1
4. Self-Rewarding-Language-Models
5. Prompt-Engineering-Guide
6. prismer
7. active-prompt
8. samapi
9. R1-V
10. Qwen2.5-VL
11. open-r1-multimodal
12. Janus
13. CogVLM
14. Awesome-LLM-Reasoning
15. llama-agentic-system
16. omniparser-api
17. OmniMCP.web

**Action:** Archive immediately with redirect messages to upstream sources.

### Category B: Superseded/Obsolete (5 repos - Archive in Phase 2)

| Repository | Replacement | Migration Required |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **OpenSanitizer** | openadapt-privacy | YES - migration guide needed |
| **OpenReflector** | N/A (experimental) | NO - minimal usage |
| **procdoc** | N/A (inactive) | NO - abandoned |
| **openadapt-gitbook** | openadapt.ai + READMEs | NO - docs migrated |
| **oa.blog** | openadapt.ai | NO - inactive |

**Action:** 30-day deprecation notice, then archive.

### Category C: Under Review (1 repo - Decide in Phase 4)

| Repository | Issue | Options |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **UI-TARS-desktop** | Fork with minimal changes | Archive OR Keep if strategic value identified |

---

## Critical Dependencies (DO NOT ARCHIVE)

These repositories have active dependencies:

| Repository | Used By | Why Keep |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **atomacos** | OpenAdapt (macOS) | macOS automation critical dependency |
| **pynput** | OpenAdapt | Input control critical dependency |
| **openadapt-privacy** | openadapt-capture, openadapt-ml | PII/PHI protection |
| **openadapt-viewer** | openadapt-evals, openadapt-ml | Visualization infrastructure |
| **openadapt-capture** | openadapt-ml, openadapt-evals | Data collection |
| **openadapt-grounding** | openadapt-agent | UI element detection |

---

## Financial Impact

### Current Maintenance Cost (Estimated)

- 49 repositories × 30 min/month average = **24.5 hours/month**
- Research forks with no activity = **8.5 hours/month wasted**
- Obsolete projects with occasional issues = **2 hours/month wasted**

### Post-Cleanup Maintenance Cost

- 24 repositories × 30 min/month average = **12 hours/month**
- **Savings: 12.5 hours/month (51% reduction)**

### One-Time Cleanup Cost

- Phase 1 archival: **3 hours**
- Phase 2 deprecation notices: **4 hours**
- Phase 2 migration guides: **8 hours**
- Phase 3 final archival: **2 hours**
- Phase 4 strategic review: **4 hours**

**Total:** ~21 hours one-time investment for 51% ongoing savings

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|------------|
| Breaking external dependencies | Medium | Low | Archives remain accessible; deprecation period |
| Lost documentation | Medium | Low | Audit before archival; migrate critical docs |
| Community backlash | Low | Low | Clear communication; migration guides |
| Accidentally archive active project | High | Very Low | Multi-person review; dependency checking |

**Overall Risk:** LOW - Well-mitigated with phased approach

- **Action:** Post deprecation notices for 5 repos
- **Time:** 4 hours
- **Risk:** Low

### Phase 3: Month 2 (Final Archival)
- **Action:** Archive Phase 2 repos after 30-day notice
- **Time:** 2 hours
- **Risk:** Low

### Phase 4: Month 3 (Strategic Decisions)
- **Action:** Decide on app, UI-TARS-desktop, fork refreshes
- **Time:** 4 hours
- **Risk:** Medium

**Total Timeline:** 3 months
**Total Effort:** ~21 hours

---

## Key Decisions Required

### Decision 1: app Repository (URGENT)
**Issue:** Created Jan 11, 2025. Only LICENSE file, no code.

**Options:**
- A. Archive immediately (no value)
- B. 30-day development deadline
- C. Transfer to developer

**Recommendation:** B - 30-day deadline

**Rationale:** Recent creation suggests intent, but similar functionality exists in openadapt-tray.

### Decision 2: Fork Maintenance Strategy
**Issue:** atomacos and pynput are 18+ months stale but critical dependencies.

**Options:**
- A. Keep as-is
- B. Sync with upstream
- C. Contribute changes upstream

**Recommendation:** B - Sync with upstream quarterly

**Rationale:** Critical dependencies requiring maintenance.

### Decision 3: Community Projects
**Issue:** OmniMCP (68 stars) has 9 months since last commit.

**Options:**
- A. Archive (inactive)
- B. Keep (community value)
- C. Transfer to community maintainer

**Recommendation:** B - Keep

**Rationale:** Highest community engagement outside main repo.

## Questions for Discussion

1. **app repository:** Archive now or give 30-day deadline?
2. **UI-TARS-desktop:** Archive or identify strategic value?
3. **atomacos/pynput:** Sync with upstream or keep as-is?
4. **Execution timeline:** Start Phase 1 this week or next?
5. **Communication:** Who owns blog post and external communication?

## Conclusion

OpenAdaptAI has evolved from a monolithic repository to a modular ecosystem with 13 active core packages. The organization now contains 49 repositories, with 61% inactive for over 6 months.

**This cleanup will:**
- Focus effort on 24 active/strategic repositories
- Archive 23 inactive/obsolete projects (read-only preservation)
- Reduce maintenance overhead by 51%
- Improve clarity for contributors and users
- Establish governance for future repository management

**Recommendation:** Proceed with phased archival plan.

**Risk:** LOW - Archives remain accessible, deprecation periods provided, migration guides created.

**Timeline:** 3 months total, 21 hours effort

**ROI:** 51% ongoing maintenance reduction for 21-hour investment
