"""Example implementations showing how to use the component library.

These examples demonstrate how different OpenAdapt packages can use
the viewer components to build their own visualizations:

- benchmark_example.py: Benchmark results viewer (openadapt-evals)
- training_example.py: Training dashboard (openadapt-ml)
- capture_example.py: Capture playback viewer (openadapt-capture)
- retrieval_example.py: Retrieval results viewer (openadapt-retrieval)
