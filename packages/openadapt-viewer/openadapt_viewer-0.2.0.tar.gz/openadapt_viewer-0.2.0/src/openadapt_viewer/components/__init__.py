"""Reusable UI components for OpenAdapt viewers.

This module provides building blocks for creating viewer HTML:
- screenshot_display: Screenshot with click/highlight overlays
- playback_controls: Play/pause/speed controls for step playback
- timeline: Progress bar for step navigation
- action_display: Format actions (click, type, scroll, etc.)
- metrics_card/metrics_grid: Statistics display cards
- filter_bar: Filter dropdowns and search
- selectable_list: List with selection support
- badge: Status badges (pass/fail, etc.)
- video_playback: Video playback from screenshot sequences
- action_timeline: Timeline with seek functionality
- comparison_view: Side-by-side comparison
- action_type_filter: Filter by action type
- failure_analysis_panel: Benchmark failure analysis

All components return HTML strings that can be composed together.
