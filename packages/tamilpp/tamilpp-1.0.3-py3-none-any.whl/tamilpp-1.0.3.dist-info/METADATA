# ðŸš€ TamilPP

**TamilPP** is a robust, Python-based programming language that empowers you to write computer programs entirely in **Tamil**.

It is designed to be a direct bridge to Python, supporting modern features like **Loops, Functions, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Error Handling, and External Libraries**. If you know Tamil, you can start coding immediately!

> **(Feature):** Since TamilPP is built on top of Python, you can import and use **any** Python library (like `math`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `random`) directly inside your Tamil code.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

You can install TamilPP globally on your computer using pip:

```bash
pip install tamilpp
