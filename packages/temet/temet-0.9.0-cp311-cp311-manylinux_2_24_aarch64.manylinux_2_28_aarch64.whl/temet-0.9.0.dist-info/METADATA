A python toolkit for the preparation, analysis, and visualization of astrophysical numerical simulations. Specifically, hydrodynamical simulations run with the [AREPO](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~volker/arepo/) moving mesh code, as well as codes producing similarly structured outputs including [GADGET-4](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget4/), [GIZMO](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html) and [SWIFT](http://swift.dur.ac.uk/).

In addition, this codebase is focused on cosmological simulations for large-scale structure and galaxy formation, particularly those processed with a substructure identification algorithm (halo finder) such as `subfind`, including [Illustris](https://www.illustris-project.org), [IllustrisTNG](https://www.tng-project.org/), EAGLE, and so on. Generally speaking, any simulation data available from the TNG public data release platform can be directly analyzed with this toolkit.

Organization
------------

* catalog/ - creation of post-processing catalogs.
* cosmo/ - analysis specific for cosmological/comoving boxes
* data/ - external text data files from the literature
* ICs/ - initial condition generation
* load/ - loading of group catalogs, snapshots, auxcats
* ML/ - machine learning
* obs/ - analysis and data reduction for observations
* plot/ - generalized plotting
* tables/ - large pre-computed datafiles (empty until downloaded)
* tracer/ - Monte Carlo tracer particles
* util/ - helper utilities and general algorithms.
* vis/ - visualization


Reproducing Published Papers
----------------------------

* projects/ - analysis and plots for specific papers/projects

The complete analysis and plot set of published papers can (theoretically) be reproduced with the following entry points 
inside the `projects/` directory. Note that in practice some analyses are costly and would better be done (and were actually 
done) by splitting into many parallel jobs on a cluster. Also note that exact reproduction may require use of an (older) code 
version, tagged on the date near the finalization of the paper.
