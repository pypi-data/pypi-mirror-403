temet toolkit: documentation
============================

Welcome to the documentation for **temet**, a python toolkit for the execution, analysis, and 
visualization of numerical simulations. Specifically, hydrodynamical simulations run with the 
`AREPO <https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~volker/arepo/>`_ moving mesh code, as well as codes 
producing similarly structured outputs including 
`GADGET-4 <https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/gadget4/>`_, 
`GIZMO <http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html>`_ and 
`SWIFT <http://swift.dur.ac.uk/>`_.

In addition, this codebase is focused on cosmological simulations for large-scale structure and 
galaxy formation, particularly those processed with a substructure identification algorithm 
(halo finder) such as ``subfind``, including `Illustris <https://www.illustris-project.org/>`_, 
`IllustrisTNG <https://www.tng-project.org/>`_, EAGLE, and so on. Generally speaking, any 
simulation data available from the TNG public data release platform can be directly analyzed 
with this toolkit.

.. caution::

    This documentation is a work in progress. Please report any issues or suggestions.

    For that matter, the entire **temet** library is a work in progress.

    It may not be the polished, well-documented, or fully-featured library you are expecting.
    Rather than being developed from scratch as a user-facing software package, it is the evolution of 
    various personal research projects, with functionality slowly generalized and expanded over time.
    As a result, it will have many rough edges and incomplete features.

    However, it is being actively developed and improved. You are welcome to play with it and see if it may 
    be useful. Feedback is always welcome!
