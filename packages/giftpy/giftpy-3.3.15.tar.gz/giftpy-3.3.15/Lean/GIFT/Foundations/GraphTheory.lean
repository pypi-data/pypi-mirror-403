## Combinatorial Connection to GIFT

The appearance of 21 = C(7,2) is NOT a coincidence in GIFT:
- K7 manifold has dimension 7
- Its second Betti number b₂ = 21
- 21 = number of edges in K₇

This suggests the TCS (Twisted Connected Sum) construction
preserves combinatorial structure from the base manifolds.

## K₄ in FirstDistinction Context

FirstDistinction uses K₄ to model partition structure.
K₄ has exactly 3 perfect matchings (ways to pair vertices).

A perfect matching in K₄ partitions 4 vertices into 2 pairs.
There are exactly 3 such partitions: {12,34}, {13,24}, {14,23}.

This connects to N_gen = 3!

## Summary: What Graph Theory Provides

1. K₇ edges = 21 = b₂ (non-trivial connection!)
2. K₄ has 3 perfect matchings = N_gen
3. E8 Dynkin has 8 vertices = rank(E8)
4. G2 Dynkin has 2 vertices = rank(G2)

These are STRUCTURAL connections, not just numerical coincidences.
