GIFT G₂ Forms: Hodge Star Operator
=================================

Hodge star ⋆ : Ωᵏ → Ωⁿ⁻ᵏ on oriented Riemannian manifolds.

We work on EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n) with standard metric.
The construction is axiom-free, using abstract structures.

## Hodge Duality Dimensions

Basic dimensional relationships for ⋆.
-/

/-- Hodge duality: k + (n-k) = n -/
theorem hodge_dual_degree (n k : ℕ) (hk : k ≤ n) : k + (n - k) = n := by
  omega

/-- Hodge dual dimensions match: C(n,k) = C(n,n-k) -/
theorem hodge_dual_dim (n k : ℕ) (hk : k ≤ n) :
    Nat.choose n k = Nat.choose n (n - k) := by
  rw [Nat.choose_symm hk]

/-- For n = 7: ⋆(Ω³) = Ω⁴ with same dimension 35 -/
theorem hodge_3_4_R7 : Nat.choose 7 3 = Nat.choose 7 4 := by native_decide

/-- For n = 7: ⋆(Ω²) = Ω⁵ with same dimension 21 -/
theorem hodge_2_5_R7 : Nat.choose 7 2 = Nat.choose 7 5 := by native_decide

## Sign Conventions

The ⋆⋆ involution has sign (-1)^{k(n-k)} which depends on parity.
-/

/-- Sign of ⋆⋆ on k-forms in n dimensions -/
def starStarSign (n k : ℕ) : ℤ := (-1) ^ (k * (n - k))

/-- For 3-forms in 7 dimensions: k(n-k) = 3*4 = 12, so ⋆⋆ = +1 -/
theorem star_star_sign_3_7 : starStarSign 7 3 = 1 := by
  unfold starStarSign
  native_decide

/-- For 2-forms in 7 dimensions: k(n-k) = 2*5 = 10, so ⋆⋆ = +1 -/
theorem star_star_sign_2_7 : starStarSign 7 2 = 1 := by
  unfold starStarSign
  native_decide

/-- For 1-forms in 7 dimensions: k(n-k) = 1*6 = 6, so ⋆⋆ = +1 -/
theorem star_star_sign_1_7 : starStarSign 7 1 = 1 := by
  unfold starStarSign
  native_decide

/-- In 7 dimensions, all ⋆⋆ signs are +1 (since k(7-k) is always even) -/
theorem star_star_sign_7_all_positive (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≤ 7) :
    starStarSign 7 k = 1 ∨ starStarSign 7 k = -1 := by
  unfold starStarSign

  interval_cases k <;> native_decide

## Abstract Hodge Star Structure

We use an abstract structure that avoids dependent type issues.
The key insight: we just need to express that ⋆ maps k-forms to (n-k)-forms.
-/

/-- Abstract Hodge star data using the GradedDiffForms type -/
structure HodgeData (n : ℕ) (Ω : GradedDiffForms n) where
  /-- Hodge star maps k-forms to (n-k)-forms -/
  star : (k : ℕ) → (hk : k ≤ n) → Ω.Form k → Ω.Form (n - k)

/-- Compatibility with the graded structure -/
structure DiffGeomData (n : ℕ) where
  /-- Graded differential forms with d -/
  forms : GradedDiffForms n
  /-- Hodge star -/
  hodge : HodgeData n forms

## Main Goal: Expressing TorsionFree Condition

The torsion-free condition for a G2 structure is:
  dφ = 0  and  d(⋆φ) = 0

where φ is the G2 3-form and ⋆φ is its Hodge dual (a 4-form).
-/

/-- Standard graded forms on ℝ⁷ (constant coefficients) -/
def R7Forms : GradedDiffForms 7 := GradedConstantForms 7

/-!
## Abstract Differential Forms API

The key point of this foundation: we can EXPRESS the torsion-free condition
using the structures above, even if we don't have a complete
concrete implementation for all of ℝ⁷.
-/

/-- Abstract G2 structure data -/
structure G2FormData where
  /-- The underlying 7-dimensional form algebra -/
  forms : GradedDiffForms 7
  /-- The G2 3-form φ -/
  phi : forms.Form 3
  /-- The dual 4-form ψ = ⋆φ -/
  psi : forms.Form 4

/-- Torsion-free condition: dφ = 0 and dψ = 0 -/
def G2FormData.TorsionFree (g : G2FormData) : Prop :=
  g.forms.d 3 g.phi = g.forms.zero 4 ∧
  g.forms.d 4 g.psi = g.forms.zero 5

/-- A closed G2 structure has dφ = 0 -/
def G2FormData.IsClosed (g : G2FormData) : Prop :=
  g.forms.d 3 g.phi = g.forms.zero 4

/-- A coclosed G2 structure has d(⋆φ) = dψ = 0 -/
def G2FormData.IsCoclosed (g : G2FormData) : Prop :=
  g.forms.d 4 g.psi = g.forms.zero 5

/-- Torsion-free = closed + coclosed -/
theorem G2FormData.torsionFree_iff_closed_and_coclosed (g : G2FormData) :
    g.TorsionFree ↔ (g.IsClosed ∧ g.IsCoclosed) := by
  unfold TorsionFree IsClosed IsCoclosed
  rfl
