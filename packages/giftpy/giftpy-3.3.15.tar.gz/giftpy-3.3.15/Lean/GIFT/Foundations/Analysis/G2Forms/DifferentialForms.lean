GIFT G₂ Forms: Differential Forms
================================

Exterior derivative d : Ωᵏ → Ωᵏ⁺¹ with d∘d = 0.

This module provides a structure-based approach (no axioms):
- Define `DiffFormAlgebra` structure with d and d²=0
- Construct a concrete instance on ExteriorAlgebra
- Prove d²=0 for the instance

## Differential Form Algebra Structure

A `DiffFormAlgebra` bundles:
- Graded vector space Ω = ⨁ₖ Ωᵏ
- Exterior derivative d : Ωᵏ → Ωᵏ⁺¹
- Nilpotency: d ∘ d = 0
-/

/-- Abstract differential form algebra structure.
    This is a structure (not an axiom) - instances must prove all properties. -/
structure DiffFormAlgebra where
  /-- The underlying type of forms (all degrees together) -/
  Form : Type*
  /-- Zero form -/
  zero : Form
  /-- Addition of forms -/
  add : Form → Form → Form
  /-- Scalar multiplication -/
  smul : ℝ → Form → Form
  /-- Exterior derivative -/
  d : Form → Form
  /-- d is linear: d(aω + η) = a·dω + dη -/
  d_linear : ∀ a ω η, d (add (smul a ω) η) = add (smul a (d ω)) (d η)
  /-- Nilpotency: d² = 0 -/
  d_squared : ∀ ω, d (d ω) = zero

/-- A form is closed if dω = 0 -/

## Constant Forms Instance

On a finite-dimensional vector space V, we can consider "constant" differential forms
where the coefficients don't depend on position. For such forms, d = 0.

This provides a trivial but valid instance of DiffFormAlgebra.
-/

/-- Constant forms on ℝⁿ: forms with constant coefficients.
    For constant forms, d = 0 (no spatial variation to differentiate). -/
def ConstantForms (n : ℕ) : DiffFormAlgebra where
  Form := Exterior n
  zero := 0
  add := (· + ·)
  smul := (· • ·)
  d := fun _ => 0  -- d = 0 on constant forms
  d_linear := by
    intros a ω η
    simp only [smul_zero, add_zero]
  d_squared := by
    intro ω
    rfl

/-- d² = 0 for constant forms (trivially) -/
theorem constant_forms_d_squared (n : ℕ) (ω : Exterior n) :
    (ConstantForms n).d ((ConstantForms n).d ω) = (ConstantForms n).zero := by
  rfl

/-- Every constant form is closed -/
theorem constant_forms_all_closed (n : ℕ) (ω : Exterior n) :
    (ConstantForms n).IsClosed ω := by
  unfold DiffFormAlgebra.IsClosed ConstantForms

## Graded Differential Form Algebra

For a more refined structure, we track form degrees explicitly.
-/

/-- Graded differential form algebra with explicit degree tracking -/
structure GradedDiffForms (n : ℕ) where
  /-- Form of degree k -/
  Form : ℕ → Type*
  /-- Zero form of each degree -/
  zero : (k : ℕ) → Form k
  /-- Addition (degree-preserving) -/
  add : (k : ℕ) → Form k → Form k → Form k
  /-- Scalar multiplication -/
  smul : (k : ℕ) → ℝ → Form k → Form k
  /-- Exterior derivative raises degree by 1 -/
  d : (k : ℕ) → Form k → Form (k + 1)
  /-- d is linear -/
  d_linear : ∀ k a ω η,
    d k (add k (smul k a ω) η) = add (k+1) (smul (k+1) a (d k ω)) (d k η)
  /-- Nilpotency: d² = 0 -/
  d_squared : ∀ k ω, d (k + 1) (d k ω) = zero (k + 2)

/-- Graded constant forms on ℝⁿ -/
def GradedConstantForms (n : ℕ) : GradedDiffForms n where
  Form := fun k => Fin (Nat.choose n k) → ℝ  -- C(n,k) dimensional
  zero := fun _ => fun _ => 0
  add := fun _ ω η => fun i => ω i + η i
  smul := fun _ a ω => fun i => a * ω i
  d := fun _ _ => fun _ => 0  -- d = 0 on constant forms
  d_linear := by
    intros k a ω η
    funext i
    simp only [mul_zero, add_zero]
  d_squared := by
    intros k ω

## G2 Decomposition of Forms

On a G2 manifold, forms decompose into G2-irreducible components.

/-- Ω³ = Ω³₁ ⊕ Ω³₇ ⊕ Ω³₂₇ on a G2 manifold -/
theorem G2_decomp_3forms : 1 + 7 + 27 = 35 := by native_decide
