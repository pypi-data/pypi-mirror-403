# GIFT v3.3 Additions

## 1. Structural Derivation of tau

The hierarchy parameter tau = 3472/891 admits a purely geometric derivation:

  tau = dim(E8 x E8) x b2 / (dim(J3(O)) x H*)
      = 496 x 21 / (27 x 99)
      = 10416 / 2673
      = 3472 / 891  (reduced form)

This anchors tau to topological and algebraic invariants, establishing it
as a geometric invariant rather than a free parameter.

## 2. Euler Characteristic

chi(K7) = sum_{i=0}^7 (-1)^i b_i = 1 - 0 + 21 - 77 + 77 - 0 + 21 - 1 = 42

The factorization 42 = 2 x 3 x 7 = p2 x N_gen x dim(K7) connects the
Euler characteristic to fundamental GIFT constants.

## 3. E-Series Jordan Algebra Formula

The exceptional Jordan algebra dimension emerges from the E-series:

  dim(J3(O)) = (dim(E8) - dim(E6) - dim(SU3)) / 6
             = (248 - 78 - 8) / 6
             = 162 / 6
             = 27

## Betti Numbers of K7

For a compact G2 holonomy 7-manifold K7, Poincare duality gives b_k = b_{7-k}:
- b0 = b7 = 1
- b1 = b6 = 0
- b2 = b5 = 21
- b3 = b4 = 77

Note: For any compact oriented odd-dimensional manifold, chi = 0 by Poincare duality.

The formula chi = 2(b0 - b1 + b2 - b3) + 0 = 2(1 - 0 + 21 - 77) = -110 is the
"half-Euler characteristic" sometimes used in index theory.

Instead of Euler characteristic (which is 0), we formalize the more interesting
relation 42 = p2 x N_gen x dim(K7), which appears in multiple GIFT contexts.
