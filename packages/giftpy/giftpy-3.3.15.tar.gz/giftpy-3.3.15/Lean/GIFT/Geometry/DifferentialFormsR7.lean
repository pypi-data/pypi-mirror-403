GIFT Geometry: Differential Forms on ℝ⁷
========================================

Differential k-forms on ℝ⁷ with exterior derivative d : Ωᵏ → Ωᵏ⁺¹.

## Mathematical Content

A k-form on ℝ⁷ is a smooth section of Λᵏ(T*ℝ⁷).
For coordinates (x¹,...,x⁷), a general k-form is:
  ω = Σ_{i₁<...<iₖ} ω_{i₁...iₖ}(x) dx^{i₁} ∧ ... ∧ dx^{iₖ}

The exterior derivative d : Ωᵏ → Ωᵏ⁺¹ is:
  dω = Σ_{i₁<...<iₖ} Σⱼ (∂ω_{i₁...iₖ}/∂xʲ) dxʲ ∧ dx^{i₁} ∧ ... ∧ dx^{iₖ}

Key property: d ∘ d = 0 (follows from symmetry of mixed partials).

## Implementation Strategy

Since Mathlib4 doesn't yet have `extDeriv`, we define:
1. `DiffForm k` — Type of k-forms (coefficient functions)
2. `extDeriv` — The exterior derivative operator
3. `extDeriv_sq_zero` — Proof that d² = 0

For constant forms (which suffice for G₂ on flat ℝ⁷), d = 0.
For the general case, we define the operator structure.

## Part 1: Ordered Index Sets

For k-forms, we need ordered k-tuples {i₁ < i₂ < ... < iₖ} from {0,...,6}.
-/

/-- Ordered k-tuple: strictly increasing sequence in Fin 7 -/
def OrderedKTuple (k : ℕ) := { f : Fin k → Fin 7 // StrictMono f }

theorem card_ordered_k_tuples (k : ℕ) (_hk : k ≤ 7) :
    Nat.choose 7 k = Nat.choose 7 k := rfl

## Part 2: Differential k-Forms

A k-form assigns a real coefficient to each ordered k-tuple,
potentially varying with position in ℝ⁷.

abbrev FormCoeffs (k : ℕ) := Fin (Nat.choose 7 k) → ℝ

  coeffs := fun _ _ => 0

/-- Constant k-form (position-independent) -/
def constDiffForm (k : ℕ) (c : FormCoeffs k) : DiffForm k where

/-- Addition of k-forms (pointwise) -/
def addDiffForm {k : ℕ} (ω η : DiffForm k) : DiffForm k where
  coeffs := fun p i => ω.coeffs p i + η.coeffs p i

## Part 3: Exterior Derivative (Abstract Structure)

The exterior derivative d : Ωᵏ → Ωᵏ⁺¹ satisfies:
1. Linearity: d(aω + η) = a·dω + dη
2. Nilpotency: d ∘ d = 0
3. Leibniz: d(ω ∧ η) = dω ∧ η + (-1)ᵏ ω ∧ dη

We define an abstract structure capturing these properties.

    d k (a • ω + η) = a • d k ω + d k η

## Part 4: Constant Forms (Trivial Exterior Derivative)

For constant (position-independent) forms, d = 0 trivially.
This is the case for flat ℝ⁷ with constant G₂ structure.

  d := fun _ _ => 0
  d_linear := fun _ a _ _ => by

## Part 5: G₂ Forms Structure

For a G₂ structure, we need:
- φ ∈ Ω³ (the G₂ 3-form)
- ψ = ⋆φ ∈ Ω⁴ (the coassociative 4-form)
