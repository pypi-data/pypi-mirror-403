## Introduction

`Landscaper` is a comprehensive Python framework designed for exploring the loss landscapes of deep learning models. It integrates three key functionalities:

- **Construction**: Builds detailed loss landscape representations through low and high-dimensional sampling, including Hessian analysis adapted from [PyHessian](https://github.com/amirgholami/PyHessian).
- **Quantification**: Applies advanced metrics, including a novel topological data analysis (TDA) based smoothness metric, enabling new insights into model behavior.
- **Visualization**: Offers intuitive tools to visualize and interpret loss landscapes, providing actionable insights beyond traditional performance metrics.

By uniting these aspects, `Landscaper` empowers users to gain a deeper, more holistic understanding of their model's behavior. More information can be found in the [documentation](https://vis4sciml.github.io/Landscaper/#).

## Quick Start

Check out the [quick start guide](https://vis4sciml.github.io/Landscaper/quickstart/) for a step-by-step introduction to using `Landscaper`.

## Documentation
The full documentation for `Landscaper` is available at [https://vis4sciml.github.io/Landscaper/](https://vis4sciml.github.io/Landscaper/#). It includes detailed instructions on installation, usage, and examples. You can build the docs locally by installing the `docs` extras and then running `mkdocs serve`.

## Installation
`Landscaper` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/landscaper/), making it easy to install and integrate into your projects.

`Landscaper` requires Python `>=3.10,<3.13` and PyTorch `>=2.0.0` and is compatible with both CPU and GPU environments. To install PyTorch, follow the instructions on the [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to select the appropriate version for your system. Then you can install `Landscaper` using pip. 

To install `Landscaper`, run the following command:

```bash
pip install landscaper
```

To install `Landscaper` with all the dependencies to run the examples, use:

```bash
pip install landscaper[examples]
```

### Docker

Additionally, `Landscaper` provides a Docker image that includes all dependencies, based on the official [PyTorch image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/pytorch/pytorch/2.6.0-cuda12.4-cudnn9-runtime/images/sha256-77f17f843507062875ce8be2a6f76aa6aa3df7f9ef1e31d9d7432f4b0f563dee). You can pull the image from the GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/vis4sciml/landscaper:latest
```
