name: Wavefunction Amplitude

# To plot a different band, edit the workflow in the UI:
#   1. Open "Wavefunction Amplitude" subworkflow unit
#   2. Find the "Select Band" assignment (last assignment unit before pp_wfn)
#   3. Change the value for "KBAND_VALUE" to one of:
#      - 'KBAND_VALUE_BELOW_EF' (to plot the highest occupied band)
#      - 'KBAND_VALUE_BELOW_EF+1'  (to plot the lowest unoccupied band)
