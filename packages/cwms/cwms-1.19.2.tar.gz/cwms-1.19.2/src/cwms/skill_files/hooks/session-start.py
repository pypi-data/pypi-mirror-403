"""
SessionStart hook for cwms.

Injects bridge summary after /clear to maintain context continuity.

When Claude executes /clear after an auto-swap, this hook:
1. Detects that the session started due to a clear (source="clear")
2. Reads the bridge summary saved by auto-swap.py
3. Injects it as additionalContext so Claude has awareness of swapped content
4. Cleans up the temporary bridge file

This is part of the automated context management workflow.
