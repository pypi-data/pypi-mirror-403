# Optionally, add custom form fields to all resource reservation webpages. These can be
# validated by defining a custom ReservationRequest (pydantic model) subclass in the
# python script. Individual resource pages can add more fields on top of this.
# The keys shown are required, but any legal html form input element styling key for the
# specified type is also allowed.
# You may not have guessed, but this one defines a password form field.
custom_form_fields:
  - type: password # a valid html form input element type
    name: password # variable name, the ReservationRequest subclass must have this as a field
    label: Password # form label string displayed
    required: True # can't leave it blank

# Optionally, add a contact email address that users can badger about issues with all
# resource reservations. "Contact [email] to report issues (click to copy)." will appear
# at the bottom of all webpages. This can be overridden on a per-resource basis.
