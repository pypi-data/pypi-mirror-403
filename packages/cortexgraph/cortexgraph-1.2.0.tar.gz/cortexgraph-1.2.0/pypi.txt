PyPI Packaging & Publishing (CortexGraph v0.4.0)

1) Verify and edit metadata (pyproject.toml)
- [project]
  - name = "cortexgraph" (if taken, fallback: "cortexgraph-ai" or "cortexgraph-memory")
  - version = "0.4.0"
  - description, readme = "README.md", license = MIT
  - authors, keywords set
  - classifiers added (Python 3.10, MIT, OS independent)
  - urls added: Homepage/Repository/Documentation/Issues
- [tool.hatch.build]
  - exclude = ["marketing/**"] to keep local notes out of the sdist/wheel

2) Build and validate locally (optional)
- python -m pip install --upgrade build twine
- python -m build
- twine check dist/*

3) Publish via CI (recommended)
- A workflow is configured at .github/workflows/publish.yml to publish on tags matching v0.*
- Add a repo secret: PYPI_API_TOKEN (create token on pypi.org, username: __token__, password: pypi-...)
- Tag main to publish:
  - git tag v0.4.1
  - git push origin v0.4.1

4) Manual publish (alternative)
- twine upload dist/*
  - export TWINE_USERNAME="__token__"
  - export TWINE_PASSWORD="pypi-<your-token>"

5) Post-publish checks
- pip install cortexgraph==0.4.1 (or the published version) in a fresh venv
- Verify entry points work:
  - cortexgraph --help
  - cortexgraph-search --help
  - cortexgraph-maintenance --help

Notes
- Pre-1.0 SemVer: use 0.y.z until cross-platform/perf testing and API stability
- If "cortexgraph" name is unavailable on PyPI at publish time, pick "cortexgraph-ai" and update the pyproject name accordingly before tagging.
- Marketing directory is excluded; keep private notes there.
