This sample demonstrates basic video decoding using the native decoder in PyNvVideoCodec.

It shows how to:
1. Create and use a demuxer to extract packets from a video file
2. Set up a basic decoder for hardware-accelerated decoding
3. Process packets and decode frames
4. Write raw decoded frames to a file

Key Learning Outcomes:
1. Basic demuxer usage for extracting video packets
2. Setting up hardware decoder with default configuration
3. Understanding the decode pipeline: Video File -> Demuxer -> Packets -> Decoder -> Raw Frames
4. Working with both device and host memory for frame data
5. Managing frame count and early termination


Usage: python decode.py -i <input_video_file> -o <output_file> -d <use_device_memory>
Example: python decode.py -i input.mp4 -o output.yuv -d 1

Arguments:
  -i: Input video file
  -o: Output raw video file (default: <input_name>.yuv)
  -d: Use device memory (1) or host memory (0) (default: 1)
  -g: GPU ID to use (default: 0)
  -f: Number of frames to decode (optional, default: all frames)

    Function to decode media file and write raw frames into an output file.

    This function demonstrates basic hardware-accelerated video decoding. Here's how it works:
    1. Creates a demuxer that reads the video file and extracts encoded frame packets
    2. Sets up a GPU decoder with default configuration
    3. The demuxer automatically extracts frame packets as you iterate over it
    4. Each packet is sent to the GPU decoder for hardware-accelerated decoding
    5. The decoder outputs raw YUV frames that can be processed or saved

    Parameters:
        gpu_id (int): Ordinal of GPU to use
        enc_file_path (str): Path to file to be decoded
        dec_file_path (str): Path to output file into which raw frames are stored
        use_device_memory (int): If set to 1, output decoded frame is CUDeviceptr wrapped in CUDA Array Interface
        frame_count (int, optional): Maximum number of frames to decode. If None, 0, or negative, decode all frames.

            Example:
            >>> decode(0, "path/to/input/media/file","path/to/output/yuv", 1)
            Function to decode media file and write raw frames into an output file.
