    Executor that runs commands remotely via RPC client.

    This executor implements both synchronous and asynchronous execution interfaces
    by wrapping an RPC client. Commands are submitted to the remote RPC server for
    execution and results are retrieved when complete.

    Attributes:
        client: The RPC client instance for communication with the remote server

    Example:
        ```python
        from clabe.rpc._client import RpcClient, RpcClientSettings

        # Create RPC client
        settings = RpcClientSettings(

        result = executor.run(cmd)
