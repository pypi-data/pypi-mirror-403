loqade is a Python SDK for neutral atom quantum computing. It provides a set of embedded domain-specific languages (eDSLs) for programming neutral atom quantum computers. Bloqade is designed to be a high-level, user-friendly SDK that abstracts away the complexities of neutral atom quantum computing, allowing users to focus on developing quantum algorithms and compilation strategies for neutral atom quantum computers.

Bloqade-lanes provides the core components for compiling neutral atom quantum circuit programs down to moves. It focuses on the physical layout and movement of atoms along fixed lanes in a neutral atom quantum processor.
