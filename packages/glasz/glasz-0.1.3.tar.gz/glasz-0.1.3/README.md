# Installation

This package is installable via `pip`. All one has to do is run

```
$ pip install glasz
```

to install the package into your current environment of choice.

## Development Version

This package uses `pixi` as the default task runner and environment manager. It
is significantly faster than any other competitor on the market (conda,
miniconda, mambda, etc...). To install [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh/latest/), click
on the link and install on your machine. It is very light weight and shouldn't
take long. From there, in this repository run the `pixi install` command and you
will gain a `pixi` environment with this package installed including all of its
dependencies. If you are not familiar with `pixi`, you can use the precomputed
`pixi.lock` file to resolve all dependencies in the creation or modification of
a `conda` environment. You can do this on your machine by running the following
command

```
$ pixi project export conda-explicit-spec conda_env_files --ignore-pypi-errors
```

which will create a directory called `conda_env_files` loaded with 3
`conda_spec.txt` files (similar to a `.yaml` but these have all the dependencies
precomputed and locked). Having the dependency conflicts precomputed is
important as `pyccl` is a monstrous library which takes a very long time to
install via `conda`. Take a look at the files, each one corresponds to a
different operating system: linux, mac-OS intel, mac-OS arm (M-chips). Choose
the file which resembles your machine and run the command

```
$ conda create --name ENV_NAME --file conda_env_files/default_{YOUR_SYSTEM}_conda_spec.txt
```

to create a new `conda` environment titled `ENV_NAME`. This environment is a
standard `conda` environment with a development version of `glasz` installed
alongside the dependencies. We provide a `conda_env_files` directory with
precomputed `conda_spec.txt` files from the current `pixi.lock` file
corresponding to the version on the main branch.
