The purpose of this repo is to create a python library to easily get information using the Apple Business Manager API using Python.

A CLI command is also included, `pyacm-cli`.

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/applebusinessmanagerapi

## Setup
If you want to setup the authentication using envvars, do the following:

You will need to setup 2 environmental variables that are provided
when creating the private key in ABM:

`AXM_CLIENT_ID` and `AXM_KEY_ID`

Place the private key in your home directory inside the `.config/pyaxm` folder
and rename it `key.pem`

This location will be used to store a cached access_token that can be reused
until it expires. While testing I have experienced that requesting too many
access tokens will result in a response with status code 400 when 
trying to get a new token.

Otherwise you will have to pass the client id, key id and private key as arguments
to the client like so:

```python
from pyaxm.client import Client

axm_client = Client(
    axm_client_id="CLIENT_ID",
    axm_key_id="KEY_ID",
    key_path="PRIVATE_KEY",
    token_path="TOKEN_PATH"
)
```
The token path is the location where the access token will be stored.

## Installation:
`pip install pyaxm`

## CLI:
A command-line interface (CLI) tool called `pyaxm-cli` is included for easy access to the API.

### Overview
The CLI provides a convenient way to interact with the Apple Business Manager API directly from your terminal. It includes commands for managing devices, MDM servers, and retrieving device information.

### Detailed Documentation
For comprehensive documentation of all available commands, options, and usage examples, please refer to the [CLI documentation](docs/cli.md).

### Updating Documentation
The CLI documentation is automatically generated from the code. To update it after making changes to the CLI implementation, run:
```bash
typer pyaxm.cli utils docs --name pyaxm-cli --output docs/cli.md
```

A GitHub workflow automatically checks that the documentation stays in sync.

# Client:
Example usage:
```python
from pyaxm.client import Client

axm_client = Client()

devices = axm_client.list_devices()
print(devices)

device = axm_client.get_device(device_id='SERIAL_NUMBER')
print(device)

mdm_servers = axm_client.list_mdm_servers()
print(mdm_servers)

# The MDM server ID can be extracted from listing all mdm servers
mdm_server = axm_client.list_devices_in_mdm_server(server_id="MDM_SERVER_ID")
print(mdm_server)

device_assigned_server = axm_client.list_devices_in_mdm_server(device_id='SERIAL_NUMBER')
print(device_assigned_server)

assignment_result = axm_client.assign_unassign_device_to_mdm_server(
    device_ids=['SERIAL_NUMBER', "ANOTHER_SERIAL_NUMBER"],
    server_id="MDM_SERVER_ID",
    action="ASSIGN_DEVICES"|"UNASSIGN_DEVICES"
)
print(assignment_result)

apple_care_coverage = axm_client.get_apple_care_coverage(device_id='SERIAL_NUMBER')
print(apple_care_coverage)
```

## Issues:
* need to add tests

This is still a work in progress
