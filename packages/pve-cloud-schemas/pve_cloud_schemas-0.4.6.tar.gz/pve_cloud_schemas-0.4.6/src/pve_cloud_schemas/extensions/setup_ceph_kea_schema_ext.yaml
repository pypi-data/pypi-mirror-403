                This dhcp is exclusively for use with a seperate network for ceph frontend communication.
                Ceph monitors are usually static and kubernetes nodes that use the csi driver need to
                be able to communicate them. The interface needs to be named "cephfe" as this is how the
                kea dhcp config is written.

          type: object
