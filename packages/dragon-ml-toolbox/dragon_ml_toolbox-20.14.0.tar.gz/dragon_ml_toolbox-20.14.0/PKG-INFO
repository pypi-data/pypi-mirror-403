# dragon-ml-toolbox

A collection of machine learning pipelines and utilities, structured as modular packages for easy reuse and installation. This package has no base dependencies, allowing for lightweight and customized virtual environments.

### Features:

- Modular scripts for data science workflows, including data exploration, ETL, model training, evaluation, and inference.
- Support for PyTorch-based models, ensemble learning (XGBoost, LightGBM), and MICE imputation.

## Installation

**Python 3.12**

### Via PyPI

Install the latest stable release from PyPI:

Using pip:

```bash
pip install dragon-ml-toolbox
```

Using UV:

```bash
uv add dragon-ml-toolbox
```

### Via conda-forge

Install from the conda-forge channel:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge dragon-ml-toolbox
```

## Modular Installation

This toolbox is designed as a collection of mutually exclusive environments due to conflicting core dependencies.

- Rule: Create a fresh virtual environment for each module to use.
