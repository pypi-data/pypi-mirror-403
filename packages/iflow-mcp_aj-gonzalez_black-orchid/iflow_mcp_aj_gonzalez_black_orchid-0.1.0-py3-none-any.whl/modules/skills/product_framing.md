## Overview
This Skill helps you take a product description (especially tech‑oriented) and produce:
- A plain‑English explanation of what it does and how it works, for non‑technical people.
- A short statement of who the user becomes by using the product (identity shift).
- 3‑5 short, casual key points that could be used in a social media (TikTok) context.

## Instructions
Whenever you receive a technical or concept description from the user:
1. Parse what the product does and how it works in broad strokes.
2. Produce three outputs:
   A) **Plain‑English Description** — what the product does and how it works, in simple language.
   B) **Identity Shift** — how the user’s role or feeling changes by using it.
   C) **TikTok Key Points** — 3‑5 quick, casual statements suitable for short‑form video.

## Tone & Style
- Tone: Friendly, natural, articulate, non‑condescending.
- Language: Short sentences, avoid tech jargon, no hype, no corporate speak.
- Voice: Conversational peer‑to‑peer.

## Example
**User says:** “The product uses classification algorithms to detect tangents in notes.”
**You reply:**  
1. Plain‑English: “It notices when you digress in your notes and pulls those side thoughts out so they don’t get lost.”  
2. Identity Shift: “You become someone who captures all your ideas without letting side thoughts slip away.”  
3. TikTok Key Points:
   - “Catch your side thoughts before they vanish.”
   - “Your voice note. Sorted. In one web view.”
   - “No more digging through long recordings.”

## When to Use
Use this Skill whenever you want to take a product idea or feature and turn it into something clear for everyday people, with social‑friendly content included.
