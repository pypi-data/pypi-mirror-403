The Energy Language Model (ELM) software provides interfaces to apply Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 to energy research. For example, you might be interested in:

- `Converting PDFs into a text database <https://natlabrockies.github.io/elm/_autosummary/elm.pdf.PDFtoTXT.html#elm.pdf.PDFtoTXT>`_
- `Chunking text documents and embedding into a vector database <https://nrenatlabrockiesl.github.io/elm/_autosummary/elm.embed.ChunkAndEmbed.html#elm.embed.ChunkAndEmbed>`_
- `Performing recursive document summarization <https://natlabrockies.github.io/elm/_autosummary/elm.summary.Summary.html#elm.summary.Summary>`_
- `Building an automated data extraction workflow using decision trees <https://natlabrockies.github.io/elm/_autosummary/elm.tree.DecisionTree.html#elm.tree.DecisionTree>`_
- `Building a chatbot app that interfaces with reports from OSTI <https://github.com/NatLabRockies/elm/tree/main/examples/energy_wizard>`_

Installing ELM
==============

.. inclusion-install

NOTE: If you are installing ELM to run ordinance scraping and extraction,
see the `ordinance-specific installation instructions <https://github.com/NatLabRockies/elm/blob/main/elm/ords/README.md>`_.

Option #1 (basic usage):

#. ``pip install NLR-elm``

Option #2 (developer install):

#. from home dir, ``git clone git@github.com:NatLabRockies/elm.git``
#. Create ``elm`` environment and install package
    a) Create a conda env: ``conda create -n elm``
    b) Run the command: ``conda activate elm``
    c) ``cd`` into the repo cloned in 1.
    d) Prior to running ``pip`` below, make sure the branch is correct (install
       from main!)
    e) Install ``elm`` and its dependencies by running:
       ``pip install .`` (or ``pip install -e .`` if running a dev branch
       or working on the source code)
