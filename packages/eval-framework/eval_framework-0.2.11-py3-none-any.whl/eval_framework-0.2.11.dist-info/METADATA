            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Why Choose This Framework?

- **Scalability**: Built for distributed evaluation. Currently providing an integration with Determined AI.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add custom models, benchmarks, and metrics with object-oriented base classes.
- **Comprehensive**: Comes pre-loaded with over 90 tasks covering a broad and diverse range, from reasoning and coding to safety and long-context. Also comes with a comprehensive set of metrics, including LLM-as-a-judge evaluations.

## Other features

- Flexible Model Integration: Supports models loaded via HuggingFace Transformers or custom implementations using the BaseLLM class.
- Custom Benchmarks: Easily add new benchmarks with minimal code using the BaseTask class.
- Custom Metrics: Easily define new metrics using the BaseMetric class.
- Perturbation Testing: Robustness analysis with configurable perturbation types and probabilities.
- Rich Outputs: Generates JSON results, plots, and detailed analysis reports.
- Statistical Analysis: Includes confidence intervals and significance testing for reliable comparisons.
- Docker Support: Pre-configured Dockerfiles for local and distributed setups.

For full documentation, visit our [Docs Page](https://aleph-alpha-research.github.io/eval-framework/).

## Quick Start

The codebase is tested and compatible with Python 3.12 and PyTorch 2.5.
You will also need the appropriate CUDA dependencies and version installed on your system for GPU support. Detailed installation instructions can be found [here](https://aleph-alpha-research.github.io/eval-framework/installation.html).

The easiest way to get started is by installing the library via `pip` and use it as an external dependency.
```
pip install eval_framework
```

There are optional extras available to unlock specific features of the library:
- `api` for inference using the aleph-alpha client.
- `comet` for the COMET metric.
- `determined` for running jobs via determined.
- `mistral` for inference on Mistral models.
- `transformers` for inference using the transformers library.
- `vllm` for inference via VLLM.

As a short hand, the `all` extra installs all of the above.

We use `uv` to better resolve dependencies when downloading the extras. You can install uv with:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
or by follwing the `uv` [installation docs.](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

Now, you can safely install the project with all optional extras:
```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```
or with pip
```bash
uv pip install eval_framework[all]
```

Tip: ensure python is properly installed with uv:
```
uv python install 3.12 --reinstall
```

We provide custom groups to control optional extras.
- `flash_attn`: Install `flash_attn` with correct handling of build isolation

Thus, the following will setup the project with `flash_attn`
```bash
uv sync --all-extras --group flash_attn
```

To evaluate a single benchmark locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
eval_framework \
    --models src/eval_framework/llm/models.py \
    --llm-name Smollm135MInstruct \
    --task-name "MMLU" \
    --task-subjects "abstract_algebra" \
    --output-dir ./eval_results \
    --num-fewshot 5 \
    --num-samples 10
```

For more detailed CLI usage instructions, see the [CLI Usage Guide](https://aleph-alpha-research.github.io/eval-framework/cli_usage.html).

## Getting Started

### Understanding the Evaluation Framework

Eval-Framework provides a unified interface for evaluating language models across diverse benchmarks. The framework follows this interaction model:

1. **Define Your Model** - Specify which model to evaluate (HuggingFace, API, or custom)
2. **Choose Your Task** - Select from 150+ available benchmarks or create custom ones
3. **Configure Evaluation** - Set parameters like few-shot examples, sample count, and output format
4. **Run Evaluation** - Execute locally via CLI/script or distribute via Determined AI
5. **Analyze Results** - Review detailed JSON outputs, metrics, and generated reports

### Core Components

- **Models**: Defined via [`BaseLLM`](https://aleph-alpha-research.github.io/eval-framework/evaluate_huggingface_model.html) interface (HuggingFace, OpenAI, custom APIs)
- **Tasks**: Inherit from [`BaseTask`](https://aleph-alpha-research.github.io/eval-framework/add_new_benchmark_guide.html) (completion, loglikelihood, or LLM-judge based)
- **Metrics**: Automatic scoring via [`BaseMetric`](https://aleph-alpha-research.github.io/eval-framework/benchmarks_and_metrics.html) classes
- **Formatters**: Handle prompt construction and model-specific formatting
- **Results**: Structured outputs with sample-level details and aggregated statistics

### Your First Evaluation

1. **Install the framework** (see Quick Start above)
```
pip install eval_framework[transformers]
```

2. **Create and run your first evaluation using HuggingFace model**:

```python
from functools import partial
from pathlib import Path

from eval_framework.llm.huggingface import HFLLM
from eval_framework.main import main
from eval_framework.tasks.eval_config import EvalConfig
from template_formatting.formatter import HFFormatter

# Define your model
class MyHuggingFaceModel(HFLLM):
    LLM_NAME = "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium"
    DEFAULT_FORMATTER = partial(HFFormatter, "microsoft/DialoGPT-medium")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize your model
    llm = MyHuggingFaceModel()

    # Running evaluation on MMLU abstract algebra task using 5 few-shot examples and 10 samples
    config = EvalConfig(
        output_dir=Path("./eval_results"),
        num_fewshot=5,
        num_samples=10,
        task_name="MMLU",
        task_subjects=["abstract_algebra", "astronomy"],
        llm_class=MyHuggingFaceModel,
    )

    # Run evaluation and get results
    results = main(llm=llm, config=config)
```

3. **Review results** - Check `./eval_results/` for detailed outputs and use our [results guide](https://aleph-alpha-research.github.io/eval-framework/understanding_results_guide.html) to interpret them

### Next Steps
