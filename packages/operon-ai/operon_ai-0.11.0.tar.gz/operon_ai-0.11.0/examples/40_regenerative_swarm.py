Example 40: Regenerative Swarm (Metabolic Self-Healing)
======================================================

Demonstrates the biological Apoptosis + Regeneration pattern where stuck
agents are detected, cleanly terminated, and replaced with fresh workers
that inherit summarized learnings from their predecessors.

Key concepts:
- Entropy monitoring: Detect stuck agents via output repetition
- Clean apoptosis: Preserve useful state before termination
- Memory inheritance: Pass learnings to successor workers
- Adaptive regeneration: New workers avoid known failure modes

Biological parallel:
- Apoptosis: Programmed cell death that removes damaged cells cleanly
- Stem cell regeneration: Replace lost cells while preserving tissue function
- Cellular debris signaling: Dying cells inform neighbors about threats

The key insight: Agent death is not just cleanup - it's information transfer.
The dying agent's experience becomes a lesson for its successor.

Prerequisites:
- Example 37 for metabolic swarm budgeting concepts
- Example 04 for basic ATP budgeting

The Regenerative Swarm demonstrates metabolic healing:

1. Entropy Monitoring: Detect stuck agents via output repetition
2. Clean Apoptosis: Terminate gracefully, preserving useful state
3. Memory Inheritance: Pass learnings to successor workers
4. Adaptive Success: Later generations benefit from earlier failures

Key biological parallel: When cells die via apoptosis, they don't
just disappear - they release signals that inform neighboring cells
about threats and help the tissue adapt.

Key software insight: Agent death is information transfer, not just
cleanup. "Worker_1 died trying strategy X" helps Worker_2 avoid the
same mistake and try something different.
