Core Types: Biological Data Structures
======================================

Biological Analogy:
- Signal: Transcription factor / ligand binding to receptor
- ActionProtein: Expressed protein that performs cellular function
- FoldedProtein: Properly folded (validated) protein structure
- CellState: Current state of the cellular machinery

These types form the categorical foundation - objects in our
biological category with morphisms defined by agent processing.
