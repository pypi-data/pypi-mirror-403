MetaSPN Game Engine - Minimal Core

A pure signal processing engine for building observable games.
Zero game semantics - only typed signals, transformations, and state.

Usage:
    from metaspn_engine import Signal, Pipeline, Engine
    
    # Define your signal type
    @dataclass
    class MySignal(Signal):
        value: float
        
    # Build a pipeline
    pipeline = Pipeline([
        normalize,
        detect_anomalies,
        emit_if_significant
    ])
    
    # Run engine
    engine = Engine(pipeline, initial_state={})
    for signal in signals:
        emissions = engine.process(signal)
