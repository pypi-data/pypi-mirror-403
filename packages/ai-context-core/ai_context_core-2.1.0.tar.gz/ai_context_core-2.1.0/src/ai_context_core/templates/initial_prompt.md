# INITIAL PROJECT ANALYSIS FOR AI

## PROJECT DATA:
- Name: {project_name}
- Type: {project_type}
- Python: 3.8+

## ANALYSIS OBJECTIVE:
[ ] Identify architecture
[ ] Evaluate code quality
[ ] Detect technical debt
[ ] Suggest optimizations
[ ] Create refactoring plan

## SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:

1. **ARCHITECTURE**: What architectural patterns do you detect?
2. **QUALITY**: What are the biggest quality issues?
3. **MAINTAINABILITY**: What would make the code more maintainable?
4. **PERFORMANCE**: Are there obvious optimization opportunities?
5. **REFACTORING**: Where would you start and why?

## REQUIRED RESPONSE FORMAT:
