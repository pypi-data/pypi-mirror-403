              with Collate products or services that provide the Software.
        
              1.2 Conditions.  In consideration of the License, Licensee’s distribution

                 notice below with each copy.
        
                    “This software is made available by Collate, Inc., under the

              Licensee’s modifications.  While redistributing the Software or
              modifications thereof, Licensee may choose to offer, for a fee or free of
              charge, support, warranty, indemnity, or other obligations. Licensee, and
              not Collate, will be responsible for any such obligations.

           2. TERM AND TERMINATION.  This Agreement will continue unless and until
           earlier terminated as set forth herein.  If Licensee breaches any of its
           conditions or obligations under this Agreement, this Agreement will

              accordance with the laws of the state of California, without reference to
              its conflict of laws principles.  If Licensee is located within the
              United States, all disputes arising out of this Agreement are subject to
              the exclusive jurisdiction of courts located in Santa Clara County,
              California. USA.  If Licensee is located outside of the United States,
              any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this
              Agreement will be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in
              accordance with the JAMS International Arbitration Rules.  The tribunal
              will consist of one arbitrator.  The place of arbitration will be Palo

              will be English.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may

              Agreement and all licenses and rights granted hereunder will immediately
              terminate.  Waiver by Collate of a breach of any provision of this

This guide will help you setup the Ingestion framework and connectors
---

![Python version 3.9+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9%2B-blue)

OpenMetadata Ingestion is a simple framework to build connectors and ingest metadata of various systems through OpenMetadata APIs. It could be used in an orchestration framework(e.g. Apache Airflow) to ingest metadata.
**Prerequisites**

- Python &gt;= 3.9.x

### Docs

### TopologyRunner

All the Ingestion Workflows run through the TopologyRunner.

The flow is depicted in the images below.
