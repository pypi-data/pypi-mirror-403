    """Performs cross-validation on the provided networks. It first shuffles the data ``Z`` and ``Y``, then partitions it into fold-count many
    equally sized subsets and then calibrates each network on the data set-minus one subset of the partition. The held out subsets are returned
    for model evaluationl. The fold-count is inferred from the length of ``network``. This implementation assumes that the networks are
    :class:`SupervisedFactorNetworks` that are calibrated using the :py:func:`volatile_factorized_pair_iterator`.

    :param Z: The input to the networks (when in inference mode) of shape [:math:`M`,:math:`N`], where :math:`M` is the total instance count and
        :math:`N` the dimensionality.
    :type Z: :class:`numpy.ndarray`
    :param Y: The factorized targets per instance of shape [:math:`M`. :math:`F`], where :math:`M` is the total instance count and :math:`F` is
        the factor count.
    :type Y: :class:`numpy.ndarray`
    :target_correlations: The desired correlations that x_a and x_b shall have along the different factors. Here, only the actual factors should be included in the list, while the residual factor will be assigned a correlation of zero. The order of entries in `target_correlations` should be aligned with the order of factors in `Y`.
    :type target_correlations: List[float]
    :param networks: The networks to be calibrated. They are assumed to be compiled with an optimizer.
    :type networks: List[:class:`SupervisedFactorNetwork`]
    :param batch_size: The size of batches used during calibration.
    :type batch_size: int
    :param epoch_count: The number of times the iterator shall cycle through the data during calibration of each network.
    :type epoch_count: int
    :param minimum_similarity: A float typically non-negative, that indicates the minimum similarity that instance in a pair need to have in order to be output by the iterator. The lower the value, the more variety there will be among pairs.
    :type minimum_similarity: float, optional, defaults to 0.0
    :param manifold_name: The name of the manifold on which the networks are fitted. Used for the title of the plot.
    :type manifold_name: str
    :param minimum_similarity: The minimum similarity that instances should have to be listed as a pair by the ``volatile_factorized_pair_iterator``.
    :param plot_losses: Indicates whether the loss per epoch shall be plotted for each network.
    :type plot_losses: bool, default False
