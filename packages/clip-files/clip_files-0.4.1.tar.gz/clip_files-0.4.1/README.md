Introducing `clip-files` - a simple yet useful command-line utility to gather files with a specific extension, format them with their full path, and copy their contents to your clipboard with a token count for GPT-4 usage!
Makes it simple to paste in your entire project into e.g., ChatGPT or Claude.ai, now that massive token limits are available.

## :star2: Features

- 📋 Collect files with a specific extension and copy their formatted contents to your clipboard.
- 📁 Surrounds each file with `<file path="...">...</file>` for easy parsing by LLMs.
- 🧮 Calculate and display the total number of tokens used, compatible with GPT-4 tokenization.
- 🔄 Easily handle and process multiple files in various directories.

## :books: Usage

To use `clip-files`, simply provide the directory to search and the file extension you want to collect:

```bash
clip-files --help
```

Shows the help message:

<!-- CODE:BASH:START -->
<!-- echo '```bash' -->
<!-- clip-files --help -->
<!-- echo '```' -->
<!-- CODE:END -->

<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
<!-- ⚠️ This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
```bash
usage: clip-files [-h] [-i INITIAL_FILE] [-f FILES [FILES ...]] [-m MAXDEPTH]
                  [folder] [extension ...]

Collect files with specific extensions or specific files, format them for clipboard, and count tokens.
There are two main ways to use clip-files:
1. Collecting all files with specific extensions in a folder:
   `clip-files FOLDER EXTENSION [EXTENSIONS ...]`
   Examples:
   - `clip-files . .py`  # all Python files in current directory
   - `clip-files . .py .md .txt`  # all Python, Markdown, and text files in current directory
   - `clip-files src .txt`  # all text files in src directory
   - `clip-files docs .md --initial-file instructions.txt`  # with custom instructions
2. Collecting specific files (can be of different types):
   `clip-files --files FILE [FILE ...]`
   Examples:
   - `clip-files --files src/*.py tests/*.py`  # using shell wildcards
   - `clip-files --files src/main.py docs/README.md`  # different file types
   - `clip-files -f src/*.py -i instructions.txt`  # with custom instructions

Options:
  -f, --files        Specify individual files to include
  -i, --initial-file A file containing initial instructions

Note: When using wildcards (e.g., *.py), your shell will expand them before passing to clip-files.

positional arguments:
  folder                The folder to search for files.
  extension             The file extensions to look for (e.g., .py, .txt). If
                        not provided, includes all non-hidden, non-binary
                        files.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i, --initial-file INITIAL_FILE
                        A file containing initial instructions to prepend to
                        the clipboard content. Default is an empty string.
  -f, --files FILES [FILES ...]
                        Specific file paths to include (e.g., --files
                        path/to/file1.py path/to/file2.md). If not provided,
                        all files with the specified extensions are included.
  -m, --maxdepth MAXDEPTH
                        Maximum directory depth to traverse (default: no
                        limit)
```

<!-- OUTPUT:END -->

`clip-files` will traverse the specified folder, gather files with the desired extension, format them with their paths, and copy the results to your clipboard along with the token count.

## :bulb: Examples

> [!TIP]
> Pro-tip! Just use `uv` to run `clip-files` without installing it.
> For example, `uv run clip-files --files *.py` will run `clip-files` in an temporary environment.

There are two main ways to use `clip-files`:

1. Collecting all files with a specific extension in a folder:

```bash
# Collect all Python files in the current directory
clip-files . .py

# Collect all text files in the documents folder
clip-files documents .txt

# Collect all Python files, including custom initial instructions
clip-files src .py --initial-file instructions.txt
```

2. Collecting specific files (can be of different types):

```bash
# Collect specific files
clip-files --files src/main.py tests/test_app.py

# Using shell wildcards to select files
clip-files --files src/*.py tests/*.py

# Mix different file types with wildcards
clip-files --files src/*.py docs/*.md config/*.json

# With custom initial instructions
clip-files --initial-file instructions.txt --files src/*.py
```

Note: When using wildcards (e.g., `*.py`), your shell will expand them before passing to `clip-files`.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

To install `clip-files`, use pip:

```bash
pip install clip-files
```

Alternatively, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/basnijholt/clip-files.git
cd clip-files
pip install .
```

Or download the script directly:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basnijholt/clip-files/main/clip_files.py
```

and run it using:

```bash
python clip_files.py --help
```

## :file_folder: Supported File Types

`clip-files` supports any file type as long as you provide the correct file extension. Common examples include:

- `.py` for Python files
- `.txt` for text files
- `.md` for Markdown files

## :1234: Token Counting

`clip-files` integrates with the `tiktoken` library to calculate tokens as they would be counted in GPT-4. This helps in understanding the cost and feasibility of processing the collected text with GPT-4 models.

The script will display the total token count after copying the formatted content to the clipboard.
