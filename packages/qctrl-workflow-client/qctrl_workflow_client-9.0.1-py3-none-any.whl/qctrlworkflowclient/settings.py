        The router to be used in the core client. Can be either

        no arguments and returns an instance of `BaseRouter`.
    product : Optional[Product]

        access to. Required for any remote execution of workflows
        (e.g. `ApiRouter`).
    organization : Optional[str]
        The organization that a core workflow should run as.
        Required for any remove execution of workflows (e.g.
        `ApiRouter`).
    event_listeners : Optional[list[EventListener]]
        Registry of listener functions where particular events
