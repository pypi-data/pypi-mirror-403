**BitBully** is a high-performance Connect-4 solver implemented in C++ with Python bindings, built around advanced search algorithms and highly optimized bitboard operations. It is designed for efficient game solving and analysis, targeting both developers interested in performance-critical implementations and researchers working on game-tree search.

> BitBully evaluates millions of positions per second in pure C++ and supports
> constant-time opening-book lookups for early-game positions. Even without
> opening databases, it can solve the entire game in under 200 seconds on
> relatively modest hardware.

### 🚀 BitBully: Getting Started with a Jupyter Notebook
<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/MarkusThill/BitBully/blob/master/notebooks/getting_started.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>

This notebook introduces the main building blocks of **BitBully**:

- `Board`: represent and manipulate Connect Four positions
- `BitBully`: analyze positions and choose strong moves

All examples are designed to be copy-pasteable and easy to adapt for your own experiments.

BitBully includes an interactive Connect-4 widget for Jupyter built with ipywidgets + Matplotlib.
`GuiC4` renders a 6x7 board using image sprites, supports move evaluation, provides undo/redo, can trigger a computer move using the BitBully engine (optionally with an opening book database). It's intended for quick experimentation and demos inside notebooks (best with `%matplotlib ipympl`).

Jupyter Notebook: [notebooks/game_widget.ipynb](https://github.com/MarkusThill/BitBully/blob/master/notebooks/game_widget.ipynb)



### High-level Python API (recommended)

#### Empty board + play moves incrementally

```python
import bitbully as bb

board = bb.Board()
assert board.play(3)          # single move (int)
assert board.play([2, 4, 3])  # multiple moves (list)
assert board.play("001122")   # multiple moves (string)

print(board)
```

#### Initialize directly from a move sequence

```python
import bitbully as bb

board_a = bb.Board([3, 3, 3, 1, 1])
board_b = bb.Board("33311")

assert board_a == board_b
print(board_a)
```

#### Create positions (moves, strings, arrays) and round-trip them

```python
import bitbully as bb

# From a move list
b1 = bb.Board([3, 3, 3, 1, 1])

# From a compact move string
b2 = bb.Board("33311")

assert b1 == b2
print(b1)

# From a 2D array (row-major 6x7 or column-major 7x6 both work)
arr = b1.to_array()  # default: column-major 7x6
b3 = bb.Board(arr)

assert b1 == b3
```

#### Legal moves and remaining moves

```python
import bitbully as bb

board = bb.Board("33333111")

print(board.legal_moves())                 # all legal columns
print(board.legal_moves(order_moves=True)) # ordered (center-first)
print("Moves left:", board.moves_left())
print("Tokens:", board.count_tokens())
```

#### Some board utilities

```python
import bitbully as bb

board = bb.Board("332311")
print(board)

print("Can win next (any):", board.can_win_next())
print("Can win next in col 4:", board.can_win_next(4))

assert board.play(4)  # play winning move
print(board)

print("Has win:", board.has_win())
print("Game over:", board.is_game_over())
print("Winner:", board.winner())  # 1
```

#### Solver Quickstart: evaluate a position and pick a move
```python
import bitbully as bb

agent = bb.BitBully()          # loads default opening book ("12-ply-dist")
board = bb.Board()             # empty board

print(board)

scores = agent.score_all_moves(board)
print("Move scores:", scores)

best_col = agent.best_move(board)
print("Best move:", best_col)
```

#### Play a small game loop (agent vs. itself)
```python
import bitbully as bb

agent = bb.BitBully()
board = bb.Board()

while not board.is_game_over():
    col = agent.best_move(board, tie_break="random")
    assert board.play(col)

print(board)
print("Winner:", board.winner())  # 1, 2, or None for draw
```

#### Tie-breaking strategies for `best_move`

```python
import bitbully as bb
import random

agent = bb.BitBully()
board = bb.Board("341")  # arbitrary position

print(board)

print("Center tie-break:", agent.best_move(board, tie_break="center"))
print("Leftmost tie-break:", agent.best_move(board, tie_break="leftmost"))

rng = random.Random(42) # optional own random generator
print("Random tie-break (seeded):", agent.best_move(board, tie_break="random", rng=rng))
```

#### Different Search Algorithms

```python
import bitbully as bb

agent = bb.BitBully()
board, _ = bb.Board.random_board(n_ply=14, forbid_direct_win=True)

s1 = agent.mtdf(board)
s2 = agent.negamax(board)
s3 = agent.null_window(board)

assert s1 == s2 == s3
print("Score:", s1)
```

---

### Low-level C++ bindings (advanced)

Use the `BitBullyCore` and `BoardCore` classes directly in Python:

#### BoardCore Examples

The low-level `BoardCore` API gives you full control over Connect-4 positions:
you can play moves, generate random boards, mirror positions, and query win
conditions or hashes.

##### Create and Print a Board

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board = bbc.BoardCore()
print(board)          # Human-readable 7x6 board
print(board.movesLeft())   # 42 on an empty board
print(board.countTokens()) # 0 on an empty board
```

---

##### Play Moves and Check for Winning Positions

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board = bbc.BoardCore()

# Play a small sequence of moves (columns 0–6)
for col in [3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3]:
    assert board.play(col)

print(board)

# Check if the side to move has an immediate winning move
print(board.canWin())      # False
print(board.hasWin())      # True, since the last move created 4-in-a-row
```

You can also check if a **specific column** is a winning move:

```python
board = bbc.BoardCore()
board.setBoard([3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4])

print(board.canWin())  # True
print(board.canWin(1))  # True  – playing in column 1 wins
print(board.canWin(3))  # False – no win in column 3
```

---

##### Set a Board from a Move List or Array

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board = bbc.BoardCore()

# From a move sequence (recommended)
assert board.setBoard([0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0])

# Convert to 7x6 array (columns × rows)
array = board.toArray()
print(len(array), len(array[0]))  # 7 x 6

# From a 7x6 array of tokens (1 = Yellow, 2 = Red)
array_board = [[0 for _ in range(6)] for _ in range(7)]
array_board[3][0] = 1  # Yellow in center column bottom row
b2 = bbc.BoardCore()
assert b2.setBoard(array_board)
```

---

##### Generate Random Boards

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board, moves = bbc.BoardCore.randomBoard(10, True)

print(board)   # Random, valid board
print(moves)   # List of 10 column indices
print(board.canWin())  # Usually False for random boards in this setup
```

---

##### Mirroring Boards and Symmetry

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board = bbc.BoardCore()
board.setBoard([0, 1, 2])      # Left side

mirrored = board.mirror()      # Mirror around center column
print(board)
print(mirrored)

# Double-mirroring returns the original position
assert board == mirrored.mirror()
```

---

##### Hashing, Equality, and Copies

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

b1 = bbc.BoardCore()
b2 = bbc.BoardCore()

moves = [0, 1, 2, 3]
for m in moves:
    b1.play(m)
    b2.play(m)

assert b1 == b2
assert b1.hash() == b2.hash()
assert b1.uid() == b2.uid()

# Copying a board
b3 = b1.copy()           # or bbc.BoardCore(b1)
assert b3 == b1

b3.play(4)               # Modify the copy
assert b3 != b1
assert b3.hash() != b1.hash()
```

These examples are based on the internal test suite and show typical ways of
interacting with `BoardCore` programmatically.

#### BitBullyCore: Connect-4 Solver Examples

The `BitBullyCore` module provides a high-performance Connect-4 solver written in C++
and exposed to Python. You can evaluate positions, score all legal moves, or run the
full MTD(f) search.

---

##### Solve a Position with MTD(f)

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

# Construct a position: alternate moves into the center column
board = bbc.BoardCore()
for _ in range(6):
    board.play(3)  # Column 3

solver = bbc.BitBullyCore()
score = solver.mtdf(board, first_guess=0)

print("Best score:", score)
```

`mtdf` returns an integer score from the perspective of the **side to move**
(positive = winning, negative = losing).

---

##### Score All Moves in a Position

`scoreMoves(board)` returns a list of 7 integers:
the evaluated score for playing in each column (0–6).
Illegal moves (full columns) are still included in the list.

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board = bbc.BoardCore()
board.setBoard([3, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2])

solver = bbc.BitBullyCore()
scores = solver.scoreMoves(board)

print("Move scores:", scores)
# Example output:
# [-3, -3, 1, -4, 3, -2, -2]
```

---

##### Using the Solver in a Loop (Move Selection)

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc
import time

board = bbc.BoardCore()
solver = bbc.BitBullyCore()

for move in [3, 4, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]:  # Example opening
    board.play(move)

start = time.perf_counter()
scores = solver.scoreMoves(board)
best_move = max(range(7), key=lambda c: scores[c])
print(f"Time: {round(time.perf_counter() - start, 2)} seconds!")
print("Scores:", scores)
print("Best move suggestion:", best_move)
# best move is into column 4
```

---

##### Further Examples using the BitBully Solver

You can initialize a board using an array with shape `(7, 6)` (columns first) and solve it:

```python
from bitbully import bitbully_core

# Define a Connect-4 board as an array (7 columns x 6 rows)
# You may also define the board using a numpy array if numpy is installed
# 0 = Empty, 1 = Yellow, 2 = Red
# Here, the left column represents the bottom row of the board
board_array = [
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
]

# Convert the array to the BoardCore board
board = bitbully_core.BoardCore()
assert board.setBoard(board_array), "Invalid board!"

print(board)

# Solve the position
solver = bitbully_core.BitBullyCore()
score = solver.mtdf(board, first_guess=0)
print(f"Best score for the current board: {score}") # expected score: 1
```

Run the Bitbully solver with an opening book (here: 12-ply opening book with winning distances):

```python
from bitbully import bitbully_core as bbc
import bitbully_databases as bbd
import importlib.resources

db_path = bbd.BitBullyDatabases.get_database_path("12-ply-dist")
bitbully = bbc.BitBullyCore(db_path)
b = bbc.BoardCore()  # Empty board
bitbully.scoreMoves(b)  # expected result: [-2, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, -2]
```

#### Further Usage Examples for BitBully Core

Create all Positions with (up to) `n` tokens starting from Board `b`:

```python
from bitbully import bitbully_core as bbc

b = bbc.BoardCore()  # empty board
board_list_3ply = b.allPositions(3, True)  # All positions with exactly 3 tokens
len(board_list_3ply)  # should be 238 according to https://oeis.org/A212693
```

#### Opening Book Examples

BitBully Databases provide fast lookup tables (opening books) for Connect-4, allowing you to query
evaluated positions, check if a board is known, and retrieve win/loss/distance values.

##### Load an Opening Book

```python
import bitbully_databases as bbd
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

# Load the 8-ply opening book (no distances)
db_path = bbd.BitBullyDatabases.get_database_path("8-ply")
book = bbc.OpeningBookCore(db_path, is_8ply=True, with_distances=False)

print(book.getBookSize())  # e.g., 34515
print(book.getNPly())      # -> 8
```

---

##### Accessing Entries

Each entry consists of `(key, value)` where:
- **key** is the Huffman-encoded board state
- **value** is the evaluation (win/loss/draw or distance)

```python
k, v = book.getEntry(0)
print(k, v)
```

---

##### Evaluating a Board Position

```python
import bitbully.bitbully_core as bbc

board = bbc.BoardCore()
board.setBoard([2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5, 5])  # Sequence of column moves

value = book.getBoardValue(board)
print("Evaluation:", value)
```

---

##### Check Whether a Position Is in the Opening Book

The books only contain one variant for mirror-symmetric positions:

```python
board = bbc.BoardCore()
board.setBoard([1, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 3])

print(book.isInBook(board))              # e.g., False
print(book.isInBook(board.mirror()))     # e.g., True, checks symmetric position
```


## Benchmarking

This section describes how **BitBully** was benchmarked against a strong **[Baseline](https://github.com/PascalPons/connect4)** solver, how the reported numbers were obtained, and how to interpret the reported *p-values*.

### Setup

The benchmark compares **BitBully** against the **Baseline** on identical Connect-4 positions, measuring *wall-clock solve time* per position.

**Position generation**
- For a fixed search depth `nply`, random but *legal* Connect-4 positions are generated.
- Each position is constructed by playing a random sequence of `nply` moves from the empty board (non-trivial positions, meaning that they do not contain a winning position for the player to move next.).
- The same position is evaluated by both solvers.

**Solvers**
- Opening books are deactivated for both solvers.
- **BitBully**: evaluated using its `mtdf` search with transposition tables enabled. Transposition Table size: $2^{20}=1\,048\,576$ entries.
- **Baseline**: evaluated using its standard `solve` routine, with transposition tables enabled. Transposition Table size: $2^{24}=16\,777\,216$ entries.
- For correctness, both solvers must return the *same game-theoretic score*; execution aborts if a mismatch occurs.

**Timing**: Each solver is timed **independently** on the same board.

**Repetitions**
- For each `nply`, the experiment is repeated `nrepeats` times (typically 25–2000, depending on search depth).
- In this case, transposition-table resets are enabled to control caching effects.

### Aggregation & Reported Metrics

From the recorded timings, the following statistics are computed:

- **Mean ± Standard Deviation**: Arithmetic mean and sample standard deviation of solve times (in seconds).
- **Speed-up**: Speed-up = mean(Baseline) / mean(BitBully). Values > 1 indicate that BitBully is faster on average.
- **Paired Statistical Test (p-value)**:A *paired* Wilcoxon signed-rank test is applied to the timing pairs.

### Statistical Significance & p-Value Interpretation

To assess whether observed speed differences are statistically meaningful, a **Wilcoxon signed-rank test** is used:

**Why Wilcoxon?**
- Timing distributions are often non-Gaussian and heavy-tailed.
- Measurements are *paired* (same position, two solvers).
- Wilcoxon is non-parametric and robust to outliers.

**Test definition**
- Null hypothesis (H₀): BitBully is **not faster** than *Baseline*.
- Alternative hypothesis (H₁): BitBully is **faster** than *Baseline*.

**p-value meaning**
- The p-value is the probability of observing the measured (or more extreme) speed advantage **if H₀ were true**.
- Very small p-values indicate overwhelming evidence that BitBully is faster.
- Values ≥ 0.05 indicate that the observed difference is *not statistically significant* at the 5% level.

### Notes & Caveats

- We left the size of the transposition table for **Baseline** as-is, likely giving it a slight advantage over BitBully.
- Benchmarks measure *solve time*, not node count or memory usage.
- Results might depend on compiler optimizations, hardware, and cache behavior.
- Small p-values are expected for large `nrepeats` when even modest speed differences are consistent.

#### Interpretation of the Benchmarking Results

The benchmarking results highlight two distinct performance regimes: **early-game (low ply)** and **mid-to-late-game (higher ply)** positions.

**Early game (0–6 ply).**
Starting from an empty board (`nply = 0`), BitBully requires on average **~198 seconds** solving the whole game, while the Baseline solver needs **~386 seconds**, resulting in an almost **2× speed-up**. This gap remains clearly visible up to about 6 ply, where BitBully consistently outperforms the Baseline, with small p-values indicating strong statistical significance.
This regime corresponds to the hardest positions in Connect-4: the branching factor is maximal and the solver must explore a large fraction of the game tree. Here, BitBully's search strategy, move ordering, and pruning heuristics pay off most.

**Transition region (7–12 ply).**
As more tokens are placed on the board, the average solve time drops rapidly for both solvers—from seconds to tens of milliseconds. BitBully still maintains a consistent advantage (≈ **1.2×–1.5×**), and the differences remain statistically significant. However, the *absolute* time savings shrink quickly: improving from 0.8 s to 0.5 s is far less noticeable than shaving minutes off an empty-board solve.

**Late game (≥14 ply).**
Beyond roughly **14 ply**, solve times become **negligible** (on the order of a few milliseconds or less) for both solvers. In this region, many positions are tactically forced, shallow, or immediately decidable via pruning. Measured differences are dominated by some BitBully overhead and partially by noise, and no statistically significant advantage can be established.
