## Abstract

*midiharmony provides fast, stand‑alone harmony analysis for MIDI files by comparing their chord and note relationships against a high‑quality database of extracted chord quads. This approach enables reliable detection of strong harmonic structure, musically coherent progressions, and potential inconsistencies, making it a practical tool for music‑AI pipelines, composition analysis, and large‑scale MIDI processing.*
