# 1. Open https://game.skport.com/endfield/sign-in and log in
# 2. Open DevTools (F12) > Application tab > Cookies > .skport.com
# 3. Find "ACCOUNT_TOKEN" cookie and copy its value
# 4. Paste it in the "token" field below
#
# Method 2: Get from Network Tab
# --------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Open DevTools (F12) > Network tab
# 2. Refresh the page
# 3. Find the request to "cookie_store/account_token"
# 4. Look at the Response and copy the "content" value
# 5. Paste it in the "token" field below
