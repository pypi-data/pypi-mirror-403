## Typing stubs for jmespath

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`jmespath`](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.py) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `jmespath`. This version of
`types-jmespath` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`jmespath==1.1.*`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/jmespath`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/jmespath)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.19.1
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.408

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`507b51f833850c4cac9e618c968f6b6ff56c26d2`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/507b51f833850c4cac9e618c968f6b6ff56c26d2).
