# User settings
Important: Before running the tests, make sure to set up your user settings.

* The settings file must be located in the subfolder steam_sdk\tests
* The file must be called settings.username.yaml, where username is your user name in the machine on which you are running the analysis.
It is recommended to start by making a copy of the example settings.SYSTEM.yaml file.
* Note: It is not recommended to change other settings files within this project (some files are generated by the software).
