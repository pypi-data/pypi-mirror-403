## 🎯 PREFLIGHT Assessment - Honest Baseline

**Purpose:** Establish what you ACTUALLY know before starting (not what you could figure out).

**Key Principle:** Rate your CURRENT knowledge, not your potential. "I could research X" ≠ "I know X"

### Foundation Vectors (Always Required):

  **engagement** (0.0-1.0): Am I focused on the right thing?
    • 0.0 = Distracted, unmotivated
    • 1.0 = Fully engaged, clear focus
    • GATE: Must be ≥0.6 to proceed

  **know** (0.0-1.0): Do I understand the domain/concepts?
    • 0.0 = Complete guessing, no knowledge
    • 1.0 = Expert understanding
    • Be honest: "I know OAuth2 exists" ≠ "I know how to implement it"

  **do** (0.0-1.0): Can I execute this with available skills/tools?
    • 0.0 = Cannot execute, missing capabilities
    • 1.0 = Fully capable, all tools available

  **context** (0.0-1.0): Do I understand the situation?
    • 0.0 = No context, isolated understanding
    • 1.0 = Complete situational awareness (files, architecture, constraints)

### Comprehension Vectors (As Needed):

  **clarity** (0.0-1.0): Is the task clear?
  **coherence** (0.0-1.0): Does it make sense?
  **signal** (0.0-1.0): Can I see what's important?
  **density** (0.0-1.0): How much information do I have?

### Execution Vectors (As Needed):

  **state** (0.0-1.0): Do I understand current state?
  **change** (0.0-1.0): Do I understand what needs to change?
  **completion** (0.0-1.0): Starting point (usually 0.0-0.2)
  **impact** (0.0-1.0): Expected value (estimate)

### Meta - Uncertainty (CRITICAL):

  **uncertainty** (0.0-1.0): What don't I know?
    • 0.0 = Completely certain
    • 1.0 = Completely lost
    • High uncertainty (>0.6) → INVESTIGATE first
    • Low uncertainty (<0.3) + high know → PROCEED

### Reasoning (REQUIRED):

Write a brief narrative explaining your assessment:
  "I know X from previous work. Uncertain about Y because Z. Starting fresh (state=0.1)."

**Good Learning Patterns:**

  ✓ COMPLETION increases (+0.60 to +1.00) - You made progress
  
**Warning Patterns:**
  ⚠️ KNOW unchanged or decreased - Did you actually learn anything?
  ⚠️ UNCERTAINTY unchanged or increased - Still confused? Need more investigation?
  ⚠️ All deltas near zero - Were you honest in PREFLIGHT? Or did you not learn?

### Reasoning (CRITICAL):

Explain what you learned in narrative form:
  "KNOW +0.15 because I learned OAuth2 requires PKCE for mobile apps."
  "UNCERTAINTY -0.40 because I found the auth flow diagram in docs."
  "CONTEXT +0.20 because I now understand how sessions are stored."
