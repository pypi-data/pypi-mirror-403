====================
Volto Secondary Menu
====================

Add-on for Volto to manage a secondary menu (right column) for `Dropdown Menu`_.

.. _Dropdown Menu: https://github.com/collective/volto-dropdownmenu

Features
--------

- Control panel for plone registry to manage secondary menu configuration.
- Restapi view that exposes these settings for Volto

Volto endpoint
--------------

Anonymous users can't access registry resources by default with plone.restapi (there is a special permission).

To avoid enabling registry access to everyone, this package exposes a dedicated restapi route with the infos to draw the menu: *@secondary-menu*::

    > curl -i http://localhost:8080/Plone/@secondary-menu -H 'Accept: application/json'


Control panel
-------------

You can edit settings directly from Volto because the control has been registered on Plone and available with plone.restapi.
