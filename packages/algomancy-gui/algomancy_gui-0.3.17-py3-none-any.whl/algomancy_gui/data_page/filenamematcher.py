    Calculates the Hamming distance between two strings.

    The Hamming distance is defined as the number of differing characters between
    two strings of equal length. If the strings are of different lengths, it will
    compare them up to the length of the shorter string and count differing
    characters, considering any excess characters in the longer string as
    additional differences.

    A mapping is bijective if every element of the domain is mapped to a unique
    element of the codomain, and every element of the codomain is uniquely

    by verifying that the lengths of the mapping's values and keys are equal
    to the mapping itself.
