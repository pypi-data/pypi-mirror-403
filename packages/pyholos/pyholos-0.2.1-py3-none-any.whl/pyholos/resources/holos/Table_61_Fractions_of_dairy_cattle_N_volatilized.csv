# This table is based on a homonym table provided by the Holos source code:

# For sake of consistency with the official Canadian Provinces abbreviations (https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/tab/index-eng.cfm?ID=t1_8),
# the column "PEI" was renamed to "PE"

# original comment:
# Table 61. Fractions of dairy cattle N volatilized as ammonia resulting from the application of manure N fertilizer,
# from select years, 1990–2020, at a provincial scale
# Implied EF (kg NH3-N volatilized kg-1 manure N applied)
#
# "Source: ECCC (2022). For years other than the select years in the above table,
# the volatilization fraction is determined based on the nearest neighbour approach."
