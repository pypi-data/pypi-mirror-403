# This table is based on a homonym table provided by the Holos source code:
# https://github.com/holos-aafc/Holos/blob/main/H.Content/Resources/Table_62_Fractions_of_swine_N_volatilized.csv
# For sake of consistency with the official Canadian Provinces abbreviations (https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/ref/dict/tab/index-eng.cfm?ID=t1_8),
# the column "PEI" was renamed to "PE"

# original comment:
# "Table 62. Fractions of swine N volatilized as ammonia resulting from the application of manure N fertilizer,
# from select years, 1990–2020, at a provincial scale"
# Implied EF (kg NH3-N volatilized kg-1 manure N applied)
#
# Source: ECCC (2022). For years other than the select years in the above table, the volatilization fraction is
# determined based on the nearest neighbour approach.
