  Pulumi Infrastructure as Code for managing Airbyte's Sentry configuration.

  This project manages:
  - Sentry projects and teams
  - Issue alerts and metric alerts
  - Dashboard configurations
  - Organization settings
  - Fingerprint rules and stack trace grouping rules
  - Ownership rules for alert routing

  SETUP: Before running `pulumi up`, generate the Sentry provider SDK:
    pulumi package add terraform-provider jianyuan/sentry

  This uses the Terraform Sentry provider directly (v0.14.8) which supports
  fingerprinting_rules, grouping_enhancements, and project_ownership on Project resources.

  The SDK is generated locally in sdks/sentry/ and is gitignored.
packages:
  sentry:
    source: terraform-provider
    version: 1.0.2
    parameters:
      - jianyuan/sentry
      - 0.14.8
