A python package for atmospheric depression detection and tracking. The main target is to capture upper tropospheric disturbances such as cutoff lows and blockng highs from their earlier stages of troughs and ridges, respectively, with their seamless transitions of basic variables such as intensity, size, duration, etc..

numpy pandas pytorch scipy xarray netCDF4 h5netcdf matplotlib cartopy  
```

If you use anaconda environment, prepare the dependencies using `conda` in advance and then install `colindex2` using conda's `pip`, as recommended by [anaconda.com](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/using-pip-in-a-conda-environment). Maybe more stable by using conda-forge.

# How to execute
Two ways are available using (1) python functions and (2) command lines

## (1) Python functions

Below examples excecute the detection and tracking with default settings.

```python
# importing
import xarray as xr
from colindex2 import Detect, Track

# load xr.DataArray of a latitude-longitude 2D field
z = xr.open_dataarray("z.nc").sel(level=300)

# execute detection with default options
Detect(z)

# execute tracking with default options
track_times = pd.date_range("yyyy-mm-dd hh", "yyyy-mm-dd hh", freq="6h")
Track(times=track_times, level=300)
```

<details>

<summary> Important default arguments (KH25) </summary>

## (2) Shell commands
Note that python3 and requirements must be installed.  

Add `-h` to see their documets.

- 1. Generate data_settings.py

```bash
gen_data_settings
```

- 2. Edit [data_settings.py](data_settings.py)

- 3. Run detection

```bash
detect z.nc
```

- 4. Run tracking

```bash
track
```

or, you can do doth as follows:

```bash
detect z.nc -track
```

<!--
- Draw maps to check tracking data and AS (netcdf output only)

```bash
$ draw_map z.nc ./d01 L 300 nps
```
-->

- Find and make each tracking data

```
find_track ./d01 L 300 a
```

## Directory structure of outputs

```
current_dir/
|
└── d01/  # default name
    |
    ├── AS/  # 2D averaged slope function
    |   └── AS-{ty}-{yyyymmddhhTT}-{llll}.nc (or .grd)
    |
    ├── V/   # point values after detection, will be used for tracking
    |   └── V-{ty}-{yyyymmddhhTT}-{llll}.csv
    |
    ├── Vt/  # intermediate data (you can remove after all processes are finished)
    |   └── V-{ty}-{yyyymmddhhTT}-{llll}.csv
    |
    ├── Vtc/ # final point values after tracking
    |    └── V-{ty}-{yyyymmddhhTT}-{llll}.csv
    |
    └── ID/  # continuous csv for a specific track whose id is `ID`
         └── {ty}-{l}-{yyyymm}-{ID}.csv
```
where, `ty` is `L` or `H`, `yyyymmddhhTT` is timestep, `llll` is level in 4 digits, and `l` is level.  


# How to use outputs
## How to load outputs in programs

- python3

 point data (`V` and `Vtc`, csv) 
```python3
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv(path_to_V, parse_dates=["time"])

# drawing ro circle
from colindex2 import draw_ro
ax = plt.axes(projection=ccrs.PlateCarree())
ax = draw_ro(ax, df)
```
 mesh data (`AS`, netcdf)
```python3
import xarray
da = xr.open_dataarray(path_to_AS).squeeze()

# drawing shading of AS
ax = plt.axes(projection=ccrs.PlateCarree())
s = ax.contourf(da.longitude,
                da.latitude,
                da,)
plt.colorbar(s)
```

<!--
- julia

 point data (`V` and `Vtc`, csv) 
```julia
using CSV, DataFrames, Dates
df = CSV.read(path_to_V, DataFrame)
df.time = DateTime.(df.time, "yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS")
```
 mesh data (`AS`, netcdf)
```julia
using Datasets
ds = Dataset(path_to_AS)
ar = ds["AS"][:,:]
```

## How to get csv for a specific track

<details>
<summary> Click here </summary>

Please obtain the ID for a specific depressin and its appeared year and month in advance.

Use `find_one` function by importing `Finder`.

```python
from colindex2 import Finder

# set output dir (default:"`./d01`") and timestep of output csv in `Vtc`
F = Finder(odir="./d01", timestep=6)

# set type (`"L"` or `"H"` for low or high detection, respectively), level (e.g., 300 hPa here), and year/month with 6 digits (e.g., 201504) when the feature appeared, and ID for the specific feature (e.g., 333)
# here, the result will be produced at "`./d01/ID/L-300-201504-333.csv`"
F.find_one("L", 300, 201504, 333)

# try below to concatenate the specific track with before splitting from and after merging to other features
F.find_one("L", 300, 201504, 333, before_split=True, after_merge=True)
```

You can use following functions (experimental, welcome bug reports!)

- `count_all(ty, lev)`: Print out count of all tracks on the specific level in the output directory.

- `find_all(ty, lev, all_in_one=False)`: Search all tracks on the specific level in a whole time range and save them as csvs. Recommended only for case studies.

| lat, lon | Central coorditates in latitude and longitude. |
| valV | Value of input field on the center |
| valX | Value of the nearest local minimum (maximum) of input field for a low (high). |
| lonX,latX | Latitude and longitude of the nearest local extremum if any, otherwise this value will be `999.9` |

| XX | Zonal discrete laplacian with a step of `ro` [m/(100 km)**2]. Small value means the feature has weak zonal concavity. `0.5` might be a good value to exclude sub-tropical large ridges. |

| \_ DC | Accumulated duration [timestep] including before split. |
| DU | Duration [hour]. |

<!--
