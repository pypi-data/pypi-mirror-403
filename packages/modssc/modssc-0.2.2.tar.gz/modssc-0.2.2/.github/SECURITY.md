# Security Policy

## Supported versions
Security fixes are provided on the latest released version and on the main branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for security reports.

Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories on the repository.
Alternative: contact the maintainers privately (see CODEOWNERS / repository maintainers).

We will acknowledge receipt and work on a fix as soon as possible.
