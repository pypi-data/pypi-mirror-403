    Any subclass of :class:`Orchestrator` orchestrates the complete pipeline: search,
    deduplication, context extraction, processing (classification), and result collection.

    Abstract methods:
        _collect_results: Collects the results from the given queue_in.
            This function is responsible for collecting and handling the results from the given queue_in. It might
            save the results to a file, a database, or any other storage.

    For each pipeline step :class:`Orchestrator` will deploy a number of async workers to handle the tasks.
    In addition it makes sure to orchestrate the canceling of the workers only after the relevant workload is done.

    For more information on the orchestrating pattern see README.md.
