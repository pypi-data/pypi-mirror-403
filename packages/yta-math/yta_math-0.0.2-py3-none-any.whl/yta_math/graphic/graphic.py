"""
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE CODE:

- First of all, the distance. Imagine the graphic
once it's been plotted. If you go from the origin
to the end, there is a distance you are virtually
drawing. That is the global distance. The distance
from the origin, normalized, is d=1.0. The origin
is d=0.0 and the end is d=1.0.

- As you are using pairs of nodes, there is also a
local distance in between each pair of nodes.
Imagine, for a second, that each pair of nodes is
a graphic by itself. The first node is the d=0.0
and the second node is the d=1.0 (in local distance
terms).

- If you have, for example, 5 pairs of nodes, as
the total global distance is d=1.0, each pair of
nodes will represent a 1/5 of that total global
distance, so each pair of nodes local distance
is a 1/5 = 0.2 of the total global distance.
Knowing that, in order, the pairs of nodes
represent the global distance as follows:
[0.0, 0.2], (0.2, 0.4], (0.4, 0.6], (0.6, 0.8]
and (0.8, 1.0] (for the same example with 5 pairs
of nodes).

- Now that you understand the previous steps, if
you think about a global distance of d=0.3, that
will be in the second pair of nodes (the one that
represents (0.2, 0.4] range. But that d=0.3 is in
terms of global distance, so we need to adapt it
to that pair of nodes local distance. As we
skipped 1 (the first) pair of nodes, we need to
substract its distance representation from our
global distance, so d=0.3 - 0.2 => d=0.1. Now, as
d=0.1 is a global distance value, we need to turn
it into a local distance value. As each pair of
nodes represents a 0.2 of the global distance, we
do this: d=0.1 / 0.2 => d=0.5 and we obtain a
local distance of d=0.5. That is the local
distance within the second pair of nodes (in this
example) we need to look for.

- Once we know the local distance we need to 
look for, as we now the pair of nodes X value of
each of those nodes, we can calculate the
corresponding X value for what that local distance
fits.

As you can see, we go from a global distance to
a local X value to obtain the corresponding Y
of the affected pair of nodes. This class has
been created with the purpose of following
an animation progress, so the distance we are
talking about is actually the amount of that
animation we have done previously so we can obtain
the next value we need to apply to obtain the
animation the graphic describes.
