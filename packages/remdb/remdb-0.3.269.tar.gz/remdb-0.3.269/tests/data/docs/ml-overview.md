# Machine Learning Overview

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming. Key concepts include:

## Supervised Learning
- Classification: Categorizing data into predefined classes
- Regression: Predicting continuous values
- Common algorithms: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks

## Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points
- Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, t-SNE
- Anomaly Detection

## Deep Learning
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data. Popular frameworks include TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Applications
- Computer Vision: Image recognition, object detection
- Natural Language Processing: Text classification, sentiment analysis
- Recommendation Systems: Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering
