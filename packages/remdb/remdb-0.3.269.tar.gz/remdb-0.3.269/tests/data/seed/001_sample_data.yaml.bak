      RESTful API design for the REM query system. Supports LOOKUP, FUZZY, SEARCH, SQL, and TRAVERSE query types.

      ## Query Types

      - LOOKUP: O(1) exact match by ID or label
      - FUZZY: Indexed fuzzy text matching
      - SEARCH: Vector similarity search with pgvector
      - SQL: Direct SQL queries for complex filters
      - TRAVERSE: Graph traversal with multi-hop relationships

      ## Authentication

      OAuth 2.0 with support for Google, Microsoft Entra ID, and custom providers.

      ## Rate Limiting

      Token bucket algorithm with per-tenant limits.

      Team reflection on Q4 achievements and challenges.

      ## Key Wins
      - Shipped REM query system with all 5 query types
      - Improved API latency by 40% through connection pooling
      - Migrated to PostgreSQL 18 with pgvector
      - Achieved 99.9% uptime in production

      ## Challenges
      - Initial performance issues with TRAVERSE queries
      - Learning curve for team on graph concepts
      - OAuth integration complexity

      ## Action Items for Q1

      # REM Query Assistant

      This agent helps users query the REM system using natural language.
      It translates user questions into REM queries (LOOKUP, FUZZY, SEARCH, TRAVERSE)
      and formats the results in a human-friendly way.

      ## Capabilities
      - Natural language to REM query translation
      - Multi-turn iterative retrieval
      - Contextual follow-up questions
      - Result summarization

      ## Example Queries
      - "What documents did Sarah write?"
      - "Find meetings about API design"
      - "Show me coding sessions from last week"
      - "What are the connections between project X and person Y?"
