Attendees: Sarah Chen, Mike Rodriguez, Alice Park, David Kim
Location: Conference Room B / Zoom Hybrid

=== AGENDA ===

1. Q4 Goals Review
2. Resource Allocation
3. Technical Priorities
4. Timeline and Milestones

=== NOTES ===

Q4 GOALS
--------
- Ship REM v2.0 with all 5 query types (LOOKUP, SEARCH, TRAVERSE, SQL, FUZZY)
- Migrate to PostgreSQL 18 with pgvector for embeddings
- Implement semantic caching for LLM queries (30% cost reduction target)
- Achieve 99.9% uptime SLA
- Onboard 10 new enterprise customers

RESOURCE ALLOCATION
-------------------
Engineering Team:
- Backend: Sarah (lead), Mike, David
- Frontend: Alice (lead), 2 contractors
- DevOps: Shared with Platform team

Budget:
- Cloud infrastructure: $15K/month
- LLM API costs: $8K/month (target: $5.6K with caching)
- Third-party services: $3K/month

TECHNICAL PRIORITIES
--------------------
1. Database Migration (Week 1-2)
   - PostgreSQL 18 upgrade
   - pgvector extension setup
   - Data migration scripts
   - Rollback plan
   Owner: Mike Rodriguez
   Status: In progress

2. Semantic Caching (Week 3-4)
   - Cache architecture design
   - Vector similarity matching
   - TTL and invalidation logic
   - Cost tracking metrics
   Owner: Sarah Chen
   Status: Design phase

3. API Rate Limiting (Week 2-3)
   - Token bucket implementation
   - Redis integration
   - Per-tenant limits
   - Monitoring dashboard
   Owner: Mike Rodriguez
   Status: Completed

4. Frontend Refactor (Week 1-6)
   - Component library migration
   - TypeScript strict mode
   - Unit test coverage >80%
   Owner: Alice Park
   Status: In progress

TIMELINE
--------
Week 1-2: Database migration, Frontend kickoff
Week 3-4: Semantic caching, API improvements
Week 5-6: Integration testing, Performance tuning
Week 7-8: Beta testing, Documentation
Week 9-10: Production deployment, Monitoring
Week 11-12: Buffer for issues, Customer onboarding

MILESTONES
----------
✓ Nov 18: API rate limiting shipped
○ Nov 25: Database migration complete
○ Dec 2: Semantic caching MVP
○ Dec 9: Frontend refactor complete
○ Dec 16: Integration testing passed
○ Dec 23: Beta release
○ Jan 6: Production release (post-holidays)

RISKS AND BLOCKERS
------------------
1. Database migration complexity
   - Risk: Data loss or corruption
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing, staged rollout, backups
   - Owner: Mike Rodriguez

2. LLM API cost overruns
   - Risk: Exceeding $8K/month budget
   - Mitigation: Semantic caching implementation
   - Owner: Sarah Chen

3. Holiday season bandwidth
   - Risk: Team availability during Dec 20-Jan 5
   - Mitigation: Code freeze, on-call rotation
   - Owner: Sarah Chen

ACTION ITEMS
------------
[ ] Mike: Complete database migration testing by Nov 25
[ ] Sarah: Design semantic caching architecture by Nov 22
[ ] Alice: Set up component library infrastructure by Nov 20
[ ] David: Create monitoring dashboard for LLM costs by Nov 23
[ ] Sarah: Schedule customer beta testing calls for Dec 16-20
[ ] All: Code freeze Dec 20 - Jan 5 (emergency fixes only)

DECISIONS
---------
✓ Approved: Semantic caching implementation (ROI: 30% cost reduction)
✓ Approved: PostgreSQL 18 migration (required for pgvector)
✓ Approved: Code freeze during holidays (Dec 20 - Jan 5)
✓ Deferred: GraphQL API (push to Q1 2025)
✓ Deferred: Mobile app (push to Q1 2025)

NEXT MEETING
------------
Date: November 22, 2024 at 2:00 PM PT
Agenda: Migration status review, caching design review
