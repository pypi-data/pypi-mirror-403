summary: Noticed significant performance degradation in vector search with large result sets
content: |
  During testing of the semantic search functionality, observed that query performance
  degrades significantly when result sets exceed 1000 vectors.

  Metrics:
  - 100 results: ~50ms
  - 500 results: ~150ms
  - 1000 results: ~400ms
  - 2000 results: ~1200ms (unacceptable)

  Hypothesis: Missing index on embedding column or inefficient distance calculation.

  Potential solutions:
  1. Add HNSW index for faster approximate nearest neighbor search
  2. Implement result pagination to limit batch sizes
  3. Consider pre-filtering strategies to reduce search space

  Need to investigate pgvector configuration and index types.
