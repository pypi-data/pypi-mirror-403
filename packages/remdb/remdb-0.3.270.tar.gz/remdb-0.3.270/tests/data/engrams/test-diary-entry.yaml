summary: Daily reflection on progress with REM system implementation
content: |
  Today made significant progress on the MCP integration. Added plan mode to ask_rem
  which allows agents to analyze graph edges without full traversal. This is going to
  be really useful for multi-turn exploration patterns.

  Also implemented the ingest_file tool with proper tenant-scoped storage. Files now
  go to ~/.rem/fs/{tenant_id}/files/{file_id}/ which keeps everything organized.

  Tomorrow: Focus on schema processing and get the agent ingestion workflow tested
  end-to-end.
