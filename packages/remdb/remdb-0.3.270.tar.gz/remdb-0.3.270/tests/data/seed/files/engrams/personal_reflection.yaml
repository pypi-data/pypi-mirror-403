  Reflecting on this week - felt a bit overwhelmed with the sprint deadlines
  but managed to ship the API rate limiting improvements on time. The team
  collaboration was excellent, especially the pairing session with Mike on
  the token bucket implementation.

  The database migration is taking longer than expected, which is stressful.
  Need to remember that good engineering takes time and rushing leads to bugs.

  Looking forward to the weekend - planning to disconnect completely and spend
  time with family. Need to maintain better work-life boundaries going forward.
  The team is doing great work, and I'm proud of what we're building together.
