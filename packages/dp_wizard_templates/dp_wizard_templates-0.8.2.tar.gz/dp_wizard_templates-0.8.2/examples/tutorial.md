DP Wizard Templates helps you build Python code from templates
which are themselves syntactically valid Python.
Templates can be composed to generate entire notebooks.

DP Wizard Templates relies on code inspection, so real working examples
need to be in code, not in a notebook or a doctest.

DP Wizard Templates was developed for
[DP Wizard](https://github.com/opendp/dp-wizard),
and that codebase remains a good place to look for further examples.


## Motivation

Let's say you want to generate Python code programmatically,
perhaps to demonstrate a workflow with parameters supplied by the user.
One approach would be to use a templating system like Jinja,
but this may be hard to maintain: The template itself is not Python,
so syntax problems will not be obvious until it is filled in.
At the other extreme, constructing code via an AST is very low-level.

DP Wizard Templates is an alternative. The templates are themselves Python code,
and the slots to fill are all-caps. This convention means that the template
itself can be parsed as Python code, so syntax highlighting and linting still work.


## Examples: dp_wizard_templates.code_template

There are two modules in this library. We'll look at `code_template` first.


```python
>>> from dp_wizard_templates.code_template import Template

>>> def conditional_print_template(CONDITION, MESSAGE):
...     if CONDITION:
...         print(MESSAGE)

>>> conditional_print = (
...     Template(conditional_print_template)
...     .fill_expressions(CONDITION="temp_c < 0")
...     .fill_values(MESSAGE="It is freezing!")
...     .finish(reformat=True)
... )

>>> print(conditional_print)
if temp_c < 0:
    print("It is freezing!")

```

Note that `conditional_print_template` is not called: Instead,
the `inspect` package is used to load its source, and the slots
in all-caps are filled. Including a parameter list is optional,
but providing args which match the names of your slots can prevent
lint warnings.

Templates can also be standalone files. If a `root` parameter is provided,
the system will prepend `_` and append `.py` and look for a corresponding file.
(The convention of prepending `_` reminds us that although these files
can be parsed, they should not be imported or executed as-is.)


```python
>>> from pathlib import Path

>>> block_demo = (
...     Template("block_demo", root=Path("examples"))
...     .fill_expressions(FUNCTION_NAME="freeze_warning", PARAMS="temp_c")
...     .fill_blocks(INNER_BLOCK=conditional_print)
...     .finish(reformat=True)
... )

>>> print(block_demo)
def freeze_warning(temp_c):
    """
    This demonstrates how larger blocks of code can be built compositionally.
    """
    if temp_c < 0:
        print("It is freezing!")

```

Finally, plain strings can also be used for templates.


```python
>>> assignment = (
...     Template("VAR = NAME * 2")
...     .fill_expressions(VAR="band")
...     .fill_values(NAME="Duran")
...     .finish()
... )

>>> print(assignment)
band = 'Duran' * 2

```

In addition to slot names as kwargs, `when` can also be used to make the fill
conditional. This can be be more readable than adding ternary expressions
or conditional blocks around the template code.


```python
>>> is_pm = True
>>> greeting = (
...     Template("print('Good TIME!')")
...     .fill_expressions(TIME="morning", when=not is_pm)
...     .fill_expressions(TIME="evening", when=is_pm)
...     .finish()
... )

>>> print(greeting)
print('Good evening!')

```

## Examples: dp_wizard_templates.converters

DP Wizard Templates also includes utilities to convert Python code
to notebooks, and to convert notebooks to HTML. It is a thin wrapper
which provides default settings for `nbconvert` and `jupytext`.

The Python code is converted to a notebook using the
[jupytext light
format](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/formats-scripts.html#the-light-format):
Contiguous comments are coverted to markdown cells,
and contiguous lines of code are converted to code cells.

If the first cell is a JSON object with the key `tagmap`,
it is used to generate a selector which can show or hide cells with particular tags.
The keys under `tagmap` will be used as options,
and the values under them are the tags to show for a particular selection.
(By default, cells with tags will be hidden.)

```python
>>> from dp_wizard_templates.converters import (
...     convert_from_notebook,
...     convert_to_notebook,
... )

>>> def notebook_template(TITLE, BLOCK, FUNCTION_NAME):
...     # {"tagmap":{
...     #   "Both": ["intro", "code"],
...     #   "Introduction": ["intro"],
...     #   "Code": ["code"],
...     #   "Neither": []
...     # }}
...
...     # (Untagged cells will always be shown.)
...
...     # + [markdown] tags=["intro"]
...     # # TITLE
...     #
...     # Comments will be rendered as *Markdown*.
...     # The `+` and `-` below ensure that only one code cell is produced,
...     # even though the lines are not contiguous
...     # -
...
...     # + tags=["code"]
...     BLOCK
...
...     FUNCTION_NAME(-10)
...     # -


>>> title = "Hello World!"
>>> notebook_py = (
...     Template(notebook_template)
...     .fill_blocks(BLOCK=block_demo)
...     .fill_expressions(FUNCTION_NAME="freeze_warning", TITLE=title)
...     .finish()
... )

>>> notebook_dict = convert_to_notebook(notebook_py, title=title, execute=True)
>>> notebook_html = convert_from_notebook(notebook_dict)
>>> expected_html = Path("examples/hello-world.html").read_text()
>>> def clean(html):
...     # Different versions of jupyter produce slightly different HTML.
...     import re
...     return re.sub(r'.*<body', '<body', html, flags=re.DOTALL)
>>> assert clean(notebook_html) == clean(expected_html)

```

The [output](examples/hello-world.html) is short,
but it is an end-to-end demonstration of DP Wizard Templates.

## Last thoughts

Because the templates are valid Python, linters and other tools
will by default include them in their coverage, and this may not be
what you want. The exact configuration tweaks needed will depend
on your tools, but here are some recommendations:

- You might keep template files under `templates/` subdirectories,
  and configure pytest (`--ignore-glob '**/templates/`) and pyright
  (`ignore = ["**/templates/"]`) to ignore them.
- For template functions, you might have a consistent naming
  convention, and configure coverage (`exclude_also = def template_`)
  to exclude them as well, or else use `# pragma: no cover`.
