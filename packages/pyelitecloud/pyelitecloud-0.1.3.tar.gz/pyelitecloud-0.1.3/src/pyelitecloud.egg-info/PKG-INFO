# pyelitecloud

Python library to communicate with Arrowhead Alarm systems via EliteCloud.
This component connects to the remote EliteCloud servers and automatically detects which alarm systems are available there.

Disclaimer: this library is NOT created by Arrowhead Alarm Producs.


# Usage

The library is available from PyPi using:
`pip install pyelitecloud`

See example_api_use.py for an example of usage.


Note that this is still a work in progress with limited (readonly) functionality.
