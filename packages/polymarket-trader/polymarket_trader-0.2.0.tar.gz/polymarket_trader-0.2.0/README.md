# Polymarket Trader CLI

A command-line tool for Polymarket CLOB trading: browse markets, inspect orderbooks, place/cancel orders, and run diagnostics. Built on `py-clob-client`.

Note: this repo contains the CLI/tooling only. Any AI skill definitions live in a separate repo.

## Install

Recommended (uv):
```
uv tool install polymarket-trader
```

Also supported:
```
pipx install polymarket-trader
# or
pip install polymarket-trader
```

## Quick Start (Polymarket UI / Proxy Wallet)

Most Polymarket accounts use a proxy (Safe) wallet that holds funds, while your MetaMask EOA signs orders. The UI shows the proxy address.

Create `~/.polymarket.env`:

```
POLYMARKET_KEY=<your MetaMask private key>
POLYMARKET_SIG_TYPE=2
POLYMARKET_FUNDER=<proxy wallet address shown on Polymarket>
POLYMARKET_SIGNER=<your MetaMask EOA address>
POLYMARKET_RPC=https://polygon-rpc.com
```

Verify:

```
polymarket-trader whoami
polymarket-trader balance --asset-type collateral
```

If allowances are all zero, open Polymarket, click Buy on any market, and approve USDC (Enable trading).

## Commands (examples)

List markets:
```
polymarket-trader markets --sampling --accepting-only --limit 50
```

Include titles:
```
polymarket-trader markets --sampling --with-title --limit 20
```

Orderbook / quote:
```
polymarket-trader orderbook <token_id>
polymarket-trader quote <token_id>
```

Buy with USD cap (best ask by default):
```
polymarket-trader buy-max <token_id> 5
```

Diagnostics:
```
polymarket-trader diagnose --onchain --fix
```

Full command list:
```
