# Rule-based judge example: absence of error patterns.
#
# EXPERIMENTAL: Rule-based judges are experimental and subject to change.
#
# This judge passes when the response does NOT contain error/failure keywords.
# No LLM inference is required - the judgment is based purely on regex matching.
#
# Usage:
#   oumi judge dataset -c regex-no-error-keywords --input data/dataset_examples/judge_input.jsonl
#
