# Rule-based judge example: regex pattern matching.
#
# EXPERIMENTAL: Rule-based judges are experimental and subject to change.
#
# This judge checks if the response contains a phone number pattern (XXX-XXXX).
# No LLM inference is required - the judgment is based purely on regex matching.
#
# Usage:
#   oumi judge dataset -c regex-match-phone --input data/dataset_examples/judge_input.jsonl
