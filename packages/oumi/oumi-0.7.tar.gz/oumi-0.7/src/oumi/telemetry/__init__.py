"""Telemetry module for Oumi usage analytics.

This module provides anonymous usage telemetry to help improve Oumi.
Analytics is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting
the environment variable DO_NOT_TRACK=1.

Use `TelemetryManager.capture_operation()` to track operations with
automatic timing, success/failure, and exception capture.

For more information, see: https://docs.oumi.ai/latest/about/telemetry.html
