    "✅ **DO:**\n",
    "- Be specific about what to reject and what to allow\n",
    "- Use clear, simple language\n",
    "- Provide examples when possible\n",
    "- Focus on behaviors, not keywords\n",
    "    \n",
    "❌ **DON'T:**\n",
    "- Be vague (\"reject bad stuff\")\n",
    "- Make policies too long (>500 words)\n",
    "- Rely only on keyword matching\n",
