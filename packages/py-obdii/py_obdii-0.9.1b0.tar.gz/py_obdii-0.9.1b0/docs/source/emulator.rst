Emulating a Vehicle
===================

Let's be honest, developing OBDII tools directly from your car isn't the most practical setup.
For convenience (and comfort), we use a vehicle emulator during development.
It simulates real car responses at your desk, allowing you to test and build features without constantly connecting to a real vehicle.

This is especially handy when you're iterating quickly, writing tests, or just don't want to sit in the driveway with a laptop balanced on your knees.

.. card:: Prerequisites

    To simulate a vehicle, you can use the `ELM327-Emulator <https://pypi.org/project/ELM327-emulator>`_, a third-party tool included automatically when you install the library with the ``sim`` extra:

    .. code-block:: console

        pip install py-obdii[sim]

    The emulator simulates a vehicle's responses and can be connected to just like a real car through a virtual serial port.

.. tab-set::
    :sync-group: os

    .. tab-item:: Linux
        :sync: linux
    
        Run and use the emulator on Linux.

        #. Install the library with development dependencies

        #. Start the ELM327 Emulator

            .. code-block:: console

                $ python -m elm -s car --baudrate 38400
            
            The emulator will display the virtual port (e.g., /dev/pts/1) to use for connection.

        #. Connect your Python code to the emulator (e.g., /dev/pts/1):

            .. code-block:: python
                :caption: main.py
                :linenos:

                from obdii import Connection

                with Connection("/dev/pts/1", baudrate=38400) as conn:
                    # Your code here

    .. tab-item:: Windows
        :sync: windows

        To run and use the emulator on Windows, you will need to create virtual serial ports.

        #. Install the library with development dependencies

        #. Install a kernel-mode virtual serial port driver like `com0com <https://com0com.sourceforge.net>`_

            .. note::

                On Windows 10 and 11, Secure Boot may block unsigned drivers.
                So make sure you download and install the signed version of com0com.

                - Files: `SourceForge Repository <https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/files/com0com/3.0.0.0>`_
                - Direct Download: `com0com-3.0.0.0-i386-and-x64-signed.zip <https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/files/com0com/3.0.0.0/com0com-3.0.0.0-i386-and-x64-signed.zip/download>`_
                

        #. Create a virtual COM port pair (e.g., COM5 ↔ COM6)

        #. Start the ELM327 Emulator on one end of the virtual connection (e.g., COM6):

            .. code-block:: console

                python -m elm -p COM5 -s car --baudrate 38400

            This command launches the emulator in *car simulation* mode on COM5.

        #. Connect your Python code to the other end of the virtual pair (e.g., COM6):

            .. code-block:: python
                :caption: main.py
                :linenos:

                from obdii import Connection

                with Connection("COM6", baudrate=38400) as conn:
                    # Your code here
