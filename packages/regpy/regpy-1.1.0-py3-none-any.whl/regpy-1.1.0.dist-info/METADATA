`RegPy` is a Python library developed at the [Institute for Numerical and Applied Mathematics](https://num.math.uni-goettingen.de) at the University of Göttingen. It provides tools to implement custom forward models -- both linear and non-linear -- as well as a variety of regularization methods and stopping rules.

This project is currently approaching beta quality state, but remains under active development. As a result, you may run into bugs or partially undocumented features. If you run into any issues we welcome any information on our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/regpy/regpy/issues).

Detailed information and documentation of the current version can be found at <https://num.math.uni-goettingen.de/regpy/>.

## Usage examples

We offer an explanation on how to use `RegPy` [here](./USAGE.md) and our website features several detailed [usage examples](https://num.math.uni-goettingen.de/regpy/examples). These examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks that serve as a tutorial-style introduction to `RegPy`.

For a more comprehensive overview of `RegPy`'s capabilities, we provide numerous examples in the [examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/regpy/regpy-examples). These examples are also part of the docker image provided on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/regpy/regpy) (see in the installation instructions for details). Most examples include both a commented Python script and a Jupyter notebook with more detailed explanations.

## Installation

We provide different installation methods, such installation using `pip`, listed and explained in [INSTALLATION.md](./INSTALLATION.md).

### Dependencies

- `numpy >= 1.14`
- `scipy >= 1.1`

#### Optional dependencies

- [`ngsolve`](https://ngsolve.org/), for some forward operators that require solving PDEs. We provide an optional installation tag `ngsolve` when installing with `pip`.
- `matplotlib` (for some of the examples)
- [`sphinx`](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) (for generating the documentation) further requirements in `doc/sphinx/requirements.txt`
