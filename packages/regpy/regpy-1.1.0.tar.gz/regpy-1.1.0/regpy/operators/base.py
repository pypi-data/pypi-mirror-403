Forward operators
=================

This module provides the basis for defining forward operators, and implements some simple
auxiliary operators. Actual forward problems are implemented in submodules.

The base class is `Operator`.

class Operator:
    r"""Base class for (forward) operators. Both linear and non-linear operators are handled. Operator
    instances are callable, calling them with an array argument evaluates the operator.

    Subclasses implementing non-linear operators should implement the following methods:

        _eval(self, x, differentiate=False)
        _derivative(self, x)
        _adjoint(self, y)

    These methods are not intended for external use, but should be invoked indirectly via calling
    the operator or using the `Operator.linearize` method. They must not modify their argument, and
    should return arrays that can be freely modified by the caller, i.e. should not share data
    with anything. Usually, this means they should allocate a new array for the return value.

    Implementations can assume the arguments to be part of the specified vector spaces, and return
    values will be checked for consistency.

    In some cases a solver only requires the application of the composition of the adjoint with the 
    derivative. When this should be used i.e. in cases when setting up elements in the codomain is 
    not feasible one can implement the `_adjoint_derivative` method and when linearizing can set the
    flag `return_adjoint_eval = True`.

    The mechanism for derivatives and their adjoints is this: whenever a derivative is to be
    computed, `_eval` will be called first with `differentiate=True` or `return_adjoint_eval=True`, 
    and should produce the operator's value and perform any precomputation needed for evaluating 
    the derivative. Any subsequent invocation of `_derivative`, `_adjoint` and `_adjoint_derivative`
    should evaluate the  derivative, its adjoint or their composition at the same point `_eval` was 
    called. The reasoning is this

     * In most cases, the derivative alone is not useful. Rather, one needs a linearization of the
       operator around some point, so the value is almost always needed.
     * Many expensive computations, e.g. assembly and factorization of finite element matrices, need to be carried
       out only once per linearization point, and can be shared between the operator and the
       derivative, so they should only be computed once (in `_eval`).
    
    For callers, this means that since the derivative shares data with the operator, it can't be
    reliably called after the operator has been evaluated somewhere else, since shared data may
    have been overwritten. The `Operator`, `Derivative` and `Adjoint` classes ensure that an
    exception is raised when an invalidated derivative is called.

    If derivatives at multiple points are needed, a copy of the operator should be performed using
    `copy.deepcopy`. For efficiency, subclasses can add the names of attributes that are considered
    as constants and should not be deepcopied to `self._consts` (a `set`). By default, `domain` and
    `codomain` will not be copied, since `regpy.vecsps.VectorSpaceBase` instances should never
    change in-place.

    If no derivative at some point is needed, `_eval` will be called with `differentiate=False`,
    allowing it to save on precomputations. It does not need to ensure that data shared with some
    derivative remains intact; all derivative instances will be invalidated regardless.

    Linear operators should implement

        _eval(self, x)
        _adjoint(self, y)

    Here the logic is simpler, and no sharing of precomputations is needed (unless it applies to the
    operator as a whole, in which case it should be performed in `__init__`).

    Note that the adjoint should be computed with respect to the standard real inner product on the
    domain / codomain, given as

        real(domain.vdot(x, y)) or real(codomain.vdot(x, y))

    Other inner products on vector spaces are independent of both vector spaces and operators,
    and are implemented in the `regpy.hilbert` module.

    Basic operator algebra is supported:

        a * op1 + b * op2    # linear combination
        op1 * op2            # composition
        op * arr             # composition with array multiplication in domain
        op + arr             # operator shifted in codomain
        op + scalar          # dto.

    Parameters
    ----------
    domain, codomain : regpy.vecsps.VectorSpaceBase or None
        The vector space on which the operator's arguments / values are defined. Using `None`
        suppresses some consistency checks and is intended for ease of development, but should 
        not be used except as a temporary measure. Some constructions like direct sums will fail
        if the vector spaces are unknown.
    linear : bool, optional
        Whether the operator is linear. Default: `False`.
