<!-- For future follow structure

## [Unreleased]

### Added: New features or components

### Changed: Changes in existing functionality

### Deprecated: Features soon to be removed

### Removed: Features removed in this version

### Fixed: Bugs that were fixed
-->

## [1.1.0]

### Added

#### Addtions to `regpy.vecsps`

- redesigned curve spaces: Different types of parameterized curves and (where applicable) also general curves can now be used interchangibly in forwarwd operators.

#### New StopRules

- L_curve, QuasiOpt, Lepskii, and Oracle stopping rules added

#### additionas to `regpy.operators`

- In Convolution operations in interpolation mode now not only complex, but also real UniformGridFct spaces can be handled.

#### additions to 'regpy.solvers'

- Added GeneralizedTikhonov solver as an interface to StopRules used for selecting the regularization parameter. 
- More solvers now extract their parameters from setting; dual quardatic Tikhonov regularization works
- Allowed initialization of Settings with exact data and implementated noise generation methods of different types in Setting.

### Changed

- Stooping of TikhonovCG now implemented by internal stoprule, which also do monitoring and allow general logical combinations

## [1.0.0]

### Added

- More test
- custom Error massages
- Random generator is now associated to the Vector spaces and can be globally seeded with a utility function in util

#### Additions to `regpy.operators`

- Operator norm: added `norm` as method to Operator to compute its norm. It uses either the new private method `_power_method` or Lanczos method using SciPy
- Setting constants in an operator:
  - Assuming the domain is a direct sum of components one can use the methods `set_constant(c,index)` to set a constant value at certain locations
  - To reset to the original operator without constants one can use the method `reset_constants()`
  - to get the currently set constants one can use `get_constants()`
- Added `PartOfOperator` as an `operators.Operator`. Making it possible to restrict to components of the codomain. One can simply index an operator by standard indexing using integers tuples, lists or slicing
- Added `Sum` and `Product` which simply take the sum or product respectively of elements in a direct sum of identical summands
- New submodule `operators.graph_operatos` implementing general graphs of operators
  - The new classes are `OperatorNode`, `Edge` and `OperatorGraph` representing nodes, edges and the entire graph respectively
- Added `OuterProduct` operator
- Added `EinSum` operator which has the same functionality as the corresponding numpy function and is capable of most multilinear algebra operations
- Added new ngsolve operator `NgsGradOP`

#### Additions to `regpy.solvers`

- New nonlinear solver `IterativelyRegularizedNewton` which combines linearization of the nonlinear operator with a subsequent linear solver that can be chosen freely from the provided linear solvers

#### Addtions to `regpy.vecsps`

- new ngsolve space `NgsVectorSpaceWithInnerProduct` that includes a mass Matrix into its inner product to allow for easier definition of operators. Note, that only the `L2` Hilbert space supports it.

#### Introducing Ducktyping

- vectors are now not limited to numpy vectors. All operations in general library are not numpy specific thus allowing general vectors.
- As vectors we can consider at its core anything that can be linearly added and supports scalar multiplication and division
- This is now used to define `TupleVectors` that are vectors of the `DirectSum` vector space and also in the ngsolve interface that is build around a custom wrapper `NgsBaseVector` adding some additional functionality and behaviour to the `BaseVector` of ngsolve

### Changed: Changes in existing functionality

- splitting core modules up into `base` or `general` submodules and specific interface modules such as numpy or ngsolve

#### Changes to Operators

- Amended old NgsSolve Operators `ProjectToBoundary`, `SolveSystem`, `LinearForm`, `LinearFormGrad`
- Moved matrix Multiplication in ngsolve to operators and renamed it

#### Changes to Solvers

- `FISTA` revision and choice of step-size by backtracking
- `Landweber` Revised now backtracking for step-size choice available
- added a general `compute_dual` method to reg solver 
- `FISTA` and `PDHG` have now a `compute_dual` method to set the dual variables

#### Changes to Setting

- `TikhonovRegularizationSetting` and `RegularizationSetting` have been combined and are replaced by `Setting` class which still has the same functionality as the previous subclasses. It can additionally extract and save data from data fidelity functionals and manage it

#### Changes to functionals

- data functionals are now identifiable via the flag `is_data_func` and can be generated using the `as_data_func` method
- data functionals have an attribute data that contains its data
- shift can now be done with additional data parameter to shift the data
- Nested `HorizontalShift` functionals are now resolved to single `HorizontalShift` functionals

#### Changes in Utility

- `operator_tests`, Changed functionality from asserts to actual logged information in warnings
- introduced test for affine linearity
- memoized properties like `gram` or `inverse` can be deleted now

#### Changes in stop rules

- The stop rules get now the solver they are applied in and get the things they need directly from the solver
- the `DualityGapStopping` now uses the `compute_dual` to compute the dual only when needed for the stopping rule
- introduced `history_dict` to the stopping rules in there the scalar values used by the stopping rule is saved.
- The stop rule know can be  copied (`copy`) and be reseted to initial state (`reset`). this can be done in one to get a reseted copy (`copy_and_reset`)
