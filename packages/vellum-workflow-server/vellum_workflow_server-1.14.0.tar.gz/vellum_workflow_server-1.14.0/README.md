# Vellum Workflow Runner Server

This package is meant for installing on container images in order to use custom docker images when using Vellum Workflows.

## Example Dockerfile Usage:

```
FROM python:3.13-slim-bookworm

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y \
    build-essential \
    ca-certificates

RUN pip install --upgrade pip

RUN pip --no-cache-dir install vellum-workflow-server==0.13.2

ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1
COPY ./base-image/code_exec_entrypoint.sh .
RUN chmod +x /code_exec_entrypoint.sh

CMD ["vellum_start_server"]
```

## Skipping Publishes

If you wish to automatically skip publishing a new version when merging to main you can add a [skip-publish] to your commit message. This is useful if your changes are not time sensitive and can just go out with the next release. This avoids causing new services being created causing extra cold starts for our customers and also keeps our public versioning more tidy.
