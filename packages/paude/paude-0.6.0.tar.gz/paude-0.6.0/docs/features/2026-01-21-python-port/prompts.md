# Prompt used to generate research and plan

/ralph-loop:ralph-loop "Let's migrate paude from a shell script to Python. I want functionality to be identical generally, although of course the install procedure will be different. We should use Python best practices including code organization, type hinting, linting, and so on. All tests will need to be migrated to Python as well. For this part of the work, we're focused only on researching how to do this and coming up with a plan. Store your research and plan in a docs/features/2026-01-21-python-port/ folder. We'll later use this research and plan to come up with a task list, but for now ONLY focus on gathering whatever research you need about the code or python best practices, write that down, and from that make a comprehensive plan." --max-iterations 7


# Prompt used to generate and refine tasks

/ralph-loop:ralph-loop "We've already done research and planning for the new port of Paude to Python - see those artifacts in the docs/features/2026-01-21-python-port/ folder. Now, we need to come up with a comprehensive list of tasks required to successfully complete this port. You are running in a paude container now (see our paude.json in this repo for details). I may need to change our paude.json before spinning up the next container that will implement our tasks. If I need to do so, include those changes required as the very first set of tasks that need to happen and I will complete those on our host setup to get paude setup for the subsequent tasks. You are not complete until the task list, including any prerequisites needed to happen on my host, are clearly defined with no ambiguity in what to do. The implementation will happen inside a ralph wiggum style claude code loop, so make sure a Sonnet or Opus model is able to follow the task list to finish the entire implementation. We should have python tests covering all major functionality that can be run as unit tests, with no live podman connection required. All these new tests should pass. All relevant docs should be updated, including docs for users, contributors, and coding assistants. We will continue looping this prompt until everything is done, so do not worry about generating the entire task list in the very first iteration. Subsequent iterations can refine and fill in missing details." --max-iterations 15

# Prompt used for implementation and review

/ralph-loop:ralph-loop "Implement the Python port of paude following the task list in docs/features/2026-01-21-python-port/TASKS.md. Read TASKS.md first to understand what needs to be done and check the Progress Tracking section to see which tasks are already complete. Work through tasks in order, marking each as complete in the Progress Tracking section when done. After completing each task, run the relevant tests to verify. When all tasks are complete, run make test, make lint, and make typecheck to verify everything passes. Continue iterating until all tests pass and all tasks are marked complete." --max-iterations 15
