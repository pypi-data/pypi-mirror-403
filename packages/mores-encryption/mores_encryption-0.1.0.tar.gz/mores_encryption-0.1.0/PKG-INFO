Lightweight, production-grade encryption library for Python.

This library provides a simple interface for AES-128 (Fernet) encryption and deterministic hashing (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256), designed for secure data handling in production environments.

## Features

- **AES-128 Encryption**: Uses the Fernet standard for symmetric encryption (AES-128 in CBC mode + HMAC-SHA256).
- **Deterministic Hashing**: Securely hash sensitive data (e.g., emails) for searchability.
- **Production Ready**: Includes proper logging, type hinting, and error handling.
- **Secure Defaults**: Automatic key generation and URL-safe Base64 encoding.

## Installation

```bash
pip install mores-encryption
```

## Configuration

The library uses environment variables for configuration. You can set these in your `.env` file or export them in your shell.

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Base64-encoded 32-byte Fernet key. | No (Auto-generated if missing) | N/A |

### Key & Salt Generation

Run these commands in your terminal to generate secure values for your `.env` file:

**Generate Encryption Key:**
```bash
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print('ENCRYPTION_KEY=' + Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

**Generate Salt (for deterministic hashing):**
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print('EMAIL_SALT=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(16))"
```

**Step-by-Step Setup:**
1. Run the commands above.
2. Copy the output (e.g., `ENCRYPTION_KEY=...`).
3. Paste it into your `.env` file in the project root.

> **Note**: For a complete integration example, refer to `integration.ipynb` (if included in the examples).

## Usage

### Basic Encryption

```python
from mores_encryption.encryption import encryption_service

# Encrypt data
encrypted_text = encryption_service.encrypt("Sensitive Data")
print(f"Encrypted: {encrypted_text}")

# Decrypt data
decrypted_text = encryption_service.decrypt(encrypted_text)
print(f"Decrypted: {decrypted_text}")
```

### Deterministic Hashing

Use this for searching encrypted fields (e.g., finding a user by email without storing the plain email).

```python
from mores_encryption.encryption import encryption_service

email = "user@example.com"
salt = "application_specific_salt_value"

# Generate hash
# Note: Salt must remain constant for the hash to be reproducible.
email_hash = encryption_service.hash(email, salt)
print(f"Hash: {email_hash}")
```

## Security Implementation Details

- **Encryption**: `cryptography.fernet.Fernet` (AES-128 CBC with PKCS7 padding, HMAC-SHA256 for integrity).
- **Hashing**: PBKDF2HMAC-SHA256 with configurable iterations (default: 200,000) and a 32-byte output length.
- **Encoding**: All outputs are URL-safe Base64 encoded strings.
