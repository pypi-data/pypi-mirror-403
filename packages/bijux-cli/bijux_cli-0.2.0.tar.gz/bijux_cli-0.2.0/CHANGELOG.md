## [0.2.0] – 2026-01-26

### Added
- Linear bootstrap flow with explicit phase boundaries and a first-class `CLIIntent`
- Rebuilt E2E suite with domain taxonomy, invariants, and a subprocess harness
- Nightly fuzz and stress suites under `tests/nightly` with dedicated markers
- Expanded regression coverage for bootstrap paths, flags matrix, plugin loader/metadata, and real serializer roundtrips
- Benchmarks with thresholds for startup, discovery (cold/warm), config load, REPL, and help/version fast paths
- API contract gating with stricter schema validation and schemathesis checks
- Docs rebuilt into concepts/guides/reference/examples with section indexes
- API purity guard enabled in CI to prevent IO in API calls

### Changed
- Centralized CLI policy resolution for routing, exit intent, and precedence
- Infra strictness: explicit formats/targets required; no guessing
- Plugin lifecycle contract with explicit states and early metadata validation
- Test organization aligned to `src/` with merged regression suite and nightly rename
- MkDocs generator and nav rebuilt to match the new docs tree

### Fixed
- Help output routing for structured formats
- Exit-policy invariants to detect real Python tracebacks only
- API validation error payloads now JSON-encoded with stable schema

### Removed
- Legacy root docs pages and ADR directory (decisions moved into canonical docs)
- Thin CLI core wrappers (emit/validation) consolidated

## [0.1.3] – 2025-08-20

### Added
* **ADR-0005:** Zero-root-pollution via **Makefile-orchestrated artifact containment** (all generated outputs under `artifacts/`).  
* **Curated release assets:** zipped bundles for **tests (py311/py312/py313)** and for **lint, quality, security, api, docs, sbom, citation, build**, plus consolidated **checksums**.
* **End-to-end automation:** GitHub Actions to **publish to PyPI**, **create a GitHub Release** with curated bundles, and **deploy docs**.

### Changed
* **Makefiles + workflows** brought into **full ADR-0005 compliance**: CI uploads/downloads only `artifacts/**`; docs deploy hydrates from CI artifacts and builds from `artifacts/docs/**`.

## [0.1.2] – 2025-08-17

### Added
* **New Documentation Engine:** Introduced a new modular documentation builder in `scripts/docs_builder/` that replaces the previous helper script.
* **CI Artifact Pages:** The documentation site now automatically generates detailed pages for all CI artifacts, including tests, linting, code quality, security, API tests, SBOMs, and citation files.
* **Release Evidence:** The `publish` workflow now downloads all artifacts from the `CI` run, packages them as `evidence/*.tar.gz` bundles, and attaches them to the GitHub Release for traceability.
* **Build Hygiene:** Makefiles now enforce a "hygienic" build process, ensuring all temporary files, caches, and build outputs are stored under the `artifacts/` directory to prevent root directory pollution.

### Changed
* **CI/CD Overhaul:**
    * The `ci.yml` workflow now uploads each category of artifact separately for better organization and downstream consumption.
    * The `docs.yml` workflow now waits for the main `CI` run to complete, downloads all artifacts, and uses them to build a data-rich documentation site.
    * The `publish.yml` workflow has been streamlined and made more robust, removing the optional "wait for docs" step and improving tag detection.
* **Documentation Content:** All top-level Markdown documents (`README.md`, `USAGE.md`, `TESTS.md`, `TOOLING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, etc.) have been significantly rewritten and expanded with tables of contents, `back-to-top` links, and cross-references to the new artifact pages.
* **Build System:**
    * All `Makefile` modules have been refactored to use the new hygienic `artifacts/` directory structure for outputs and caches.
    * `tox.ini` has been updated to align with the new Makefile targets and to run a comprehensive suite of checks for the `py311` environment, mirroring the full CI validation process.
* **API Schema:** The OpenAPI `schema.yaml` has been improved with stricter validation (`additionalProperties: false`), better descriptions, response links, and more detailed examples.
* **Source Code:** Refactored async handling in `src/bijux_cli/api.py` and improved type safety across multiple modules with clearer casts.

### Fixed
* **Type Safety:** Resolved numerous previously ignored type errors throughout the codebase and test suite.
* **API Endpoint Logic:** Corrected the item update logic in `src/bijux_cli/httpapi.py` by removing a faulty check for duplicate names that was causing incorrect 409 Conflict errors.
* **Test Suite:** Improved the stability and correctness of E2E tests by enhancing golden file comparisons and fixing brittle assertions.

## [0.1.1] – 2025-08-14

### Added
* **Publish pipeline:** GitHub Actions `publish.yml` that publishes via `make publish` only after required checks are green and a tag is present.
* **Project map:** `PROJECT_TREE.md` (and `docs/project_tree.md`) with a curated overview.
* **Developer Tooling page:** `TOOLING.md` (and `docs/tooling.md`) with embedded configs, Makefile snippets, and CI workflows via `include-markdown`.
* **Docs assets:** Community landing page, Plausible analytics partial, and CSS overrides.

### Changed
* **Docs generator (`scripts/docs_builder/mkdocs_manager.py`):**
  * Copies **README**, **USAGE**, **TESTS**, **PROJECT_TREE**, and **TOOLING** into the site with link rewrites and `{#top}` anchors.
  * Generates mkdocstrings pages for all modules under `src/bijux_cli/**`.
  * Builds **one** consolidated **API Reference** with this structure:
    * top: **Api Module**, **Cli Module**, **Httpapi Module**
    * sections (collapsed by default): **Commands**, **Contracts**, **Core**, **Infra**, **Services**
    * nested groups for command subpackages (`config/`, `dev/`, `history/`, `memory/`, `plugins/`) beneath **Commands**.
  * Emits `reference/**/index.md` to power Material’s section indexes.
* **MkDocs config (`mkdocs.yml`):** tightened plugin ordering and settings for `include-markdown`, enabled section indexes, and strict mode; added watch paths for configs and scripts.
* **README / USAGE:** Refined copy; standardized **top anchors** and links to **TESTS.md**/**PROJECT_TREE.md**/**TOOLING.md**.
* **SECURITY.md:** Rewritten with clearer reporting, SLAs, scope, and safe harbor.
* **Makefiles:** macOS-safe env handling; Cairo-less Interrogate wrapper for doc coverage.
* **Config:** Expanded lints/dictionary.

### Fixed
* **Docs build (strict):** resolved broken/unknown links in **TOOLING.md** and removed duplicate **API Reference** sections; left sidebar now stays populated when deep-linking into API pages.
* **Tests:** E2E version fixtures cleaned up.

### Packaging
* **PyPI links corrected:** `project.urls` now points to accurate Homepage/Docs/Changelog/Issues/Discussions.
* **Dynamic versioning from Git tags:** Using `hatch-vcs` with `dynamic = ["version"]`; annotated tags like `v0.1.1` define the release version. `commitizen` tags as `v$version`.
* **Richer PyPI description:** `hatch-fancy-pypi-readme` renders **README.md** + **CHANGELOG.md** on PyPI.
* **Wheel/Sdist layout:** Explicit Hatch build config ensures `py.typed`, licenses, and metadata are included.
