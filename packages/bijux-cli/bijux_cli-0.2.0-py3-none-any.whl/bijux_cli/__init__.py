"""The top-level package for the Bijux CLI application.

This module serves as the main public entry point for the `bijux-cli` package.
It exposes the key components required for both command-line execution and
programmatic integration.

The primary exports are:
    * `entry_point`: The function used by `console_scripts` to start the CLI.
    * `BijuxAPI`: A high-level, synchronous facade for using the CLI's
        functionality within other Python applications.
    * `version` and `api_version`: The application and plugin API versions.
