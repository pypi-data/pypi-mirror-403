"""Defines the `dev` command group for the Bijux CLI.

This module serves as the central entry point for all developer-focused tools
and diagnostics. It aggregates the various subcommands into a single `Typer`
application, creating the `bijux dev` command hierarchy.

The `dev` command, when run without a subcommand, provides a simple status
confirmation.

The available subcommands are:
    * `di`: Displays the dependency injection (DI) container graph.
    * `list-plugins`: Lists all installed CLI plugins.

Exit codes for the subcommands generally follow this pattern:
    * `0`: Success.
    * `1`: An internal or unexpected error occurred.
    * `2`: An invalid argument was provided (e.g., bad format).
    * `3`: An ASCII or encoding error was detected.
