def suno_music_generation_guide() -> str:
    """Guide for choosing the right Suno tool for music generation."""
    return """# Suno Music Generation Guide

When the user wants to generate music, choose the appropriate tool based on their needs:

## Quick Generation (Inspiration Mode)
**Tool:** `suno_generate_music`
**Use when:**
- User gives a simple description: "make me a birthday song"
- User wants Suno to handle lyrics and arrangement
- Quick, low-effort music creation

**Example:** "Create an upbeat pop song about summer"
→ Call `suno_generate_music` with prompt="An upbeat pop song about summer, fun, beach vibes, catchy melody"

## Custom Generation (Full Control)
**Tool:** `suno_generate_custom_music`
**Use when:**
- User provides specific lyrics
- User wants control over title and style
- User specifies vocal gender preference

**Example:** "Here are my lyrics: [Verse] Walking in the rain..."
→ Call `suno_generate_custom_music` with the provided lyrics, a title, and appropriate style

## Extending Songs
**Tool:** `suno_extend_music`
**Use when:**
- User wants to make a song longer
- User wants to add more sections to an existing song
- Building a multi-part composition

**After extending:** Use `suno_concat_music` to merge all segments into one file.

## Creating Covers
**Tool:** `suno_cover_music`
**Use when:**
- User wants a different version of an existing song
- "Make it jazz", "acoustic version", "remix"

## Generating Lyrics Only
**Tool:** `suno_generate_lyrics`
**Use when:**
- User wants lyrics without music yet
- User wants to review/edit lyrics before generating music

## Checking Status
**Tool:** `suno_get_task`
**Use when:**
- Generation takes time and user wants to check if it's ready
- User asks "is my song done?"

## Important Notes:
1. Music generation is async - always return the task_id to the user
2. Default model is chirp-v4-5 (good balance of quality and speed)
3. For longest songs (8 min), use chirp-v5 or chirp-v4-5-plus
4. Vocal gender only works on v4.5+ models

## Style Negative Examples

Use style_negative to exclude:

- "heavy metal, screaming" - for softer songs
- "electronic, synth" - for acoustic sound
- "slow, ballad" - for upbeat songs

## Lyric Section Tips

Each section has a purpose:
- **[Intro]:** Set the mood, can be instrumental
- **[Verse]:** Tell the story, build narrative
- **[Pre-Chorus]:** Build tension before the hook
- **[Chorus]:** The catchiest, most memorable part
- **[Bridge]:** Contrast, often emotional peak
- **[Outro]:** Wind down, resolve the song
