Section Markers (use square brackets):
- [Verse] or [Verse 1], [Verse 2]: Main storytelling sections
- [Chorus]: Repeated catchy section (the hook)
- [Pre-Chorus]: Build-up before chorus
- [Bridge]: Contrasting section, usually near the end
- [Outro]: Ending section
- [Intro]: Opening instrumental or vocals

Example Structure:
```
[Verse 1]
First verse lyrics here
Setting up the story

[Pre-Chorus]
Building anticipation
Leading to the hook

[Chorus]
The main hook goes here
Most memorable part
Repeat this section

[Verse 2]
Second verse continues
The narrative unfolds

[Chorus]
The main hook goes here
Most memorable part
Repeat this section

[Bridge]
Something different here
A twist or climax

[Chorus]
The main hook goes here
Most memorable part
Final repetition

[Outro]
Winding down
Fade out
```

Tips for Best Results:
- Keep lines concise (4-8 words) for better singing flow
- Use simple, clear language that's easy to sing
- Include rhymes for catchiness (especially in chorus)
- Leave some creative freedom for the AI
- Use consistent line lengths within sections
- End verses with a lead-in to the chorus
