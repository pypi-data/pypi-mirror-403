"""
Launch package - commands for starting Claude Code in Docker sandboxes.

This package contains the decomposed launch functionality:
- render.py: Pure output/display functions (no business logic)
- flow.py: Start command logic and interactive flows
- app.py: Thin CLI wrapper for Typer registration

Public API re-exports for backward compatibility.
