    Execute the Docker sandbox with all configurations applied.

    Safety-net policy from org config is extracted and mounted read-only.

        workspace_path: Path to the actual workspace for session recording.
        mount_path: Docker mount path (may differ for worktrees).
        team: Team profile name.

        should_continue_session: Whether to continue existing session.
