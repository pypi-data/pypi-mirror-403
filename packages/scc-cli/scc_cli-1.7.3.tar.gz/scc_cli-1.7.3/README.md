Run [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (Anthropic's AI coding CLI) in Docker sandboxes with organization-managed team profiles and git worktree support.

SCC isolates AI execution in containers, enforces branch safety, and prevents destructive git commands. Organizations distribute plugins through a central config—developers get standardized setups without manual configuration.

> **Plugin Marketplace:** Extend Claude with the [official plugin marketplace](https://github.com/CCimen/sandboxed-code-plugins). Start with [**scc-safety-net**](https://scc-cli.dev/plugins/safety-net/) to block destructive git commands like `push --force`.

## 30-Second Guide

**Requires:** Python 3.10+, Docker Desktop 4.50+, Git 2.30+

```bash
uv tool install scc-cli  # Install (recommended)
scc setup                # Configure (paste your org URL, pick your team)
cd ~/project && scc      # Auto-detect workspace and launch (or scc start ~/project)
```

> **Alternative:** `pip install scc-cli` works if you don't have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

Run `scc doctor` to verify your environment or troubleshoot issues.

### Smart Start Flow

When you run `scc` or `scc start`:
- **Auto-detects workspace** from git repository root or `.scc.yaml` location
- **Shows Quick Resume** if you have recent sessions for this workspace
- **Prints brief context** (workspace root, entry directory, team) before launching
- **Applies personal profile** (if saved) after team config, before workspace overrides
- **Bypass mode enabled**: Permission prompts are skipped by default since the Docker sandbox already provides isolation. This does not prevent access to files inside the mounted workspace. Press `Shift+Tab` inside Claude to toggle permissions back on if needed
- **Safety guard**: Won't auto-launch from suspicious directories (home, `/tmp`). Explicit paths like `scc start ~/` prompt for confirmation

**Keyboard shortcuts in dashboard:**
- `↑↓` — Navigate list
- `Enter` — Open action menu (containers/sessions/worktrees)
- `Tab` — Switch between tabs
- `n` — Start new session
- `t` — Switch team
- `p` — Profile quick menu (save/apply/diff)
- `r` — Refresh
- `s` — Settings & maintenance
- `?` — Help
- `q` — Quit

### Find Your Path

| You are... | Start here |
|------------|------------|
| **Developer** joining a team | [Developer Onboarding](#developer-onboarding) — what you get automatically |
| **Team Lead** setting up your team | [Team Setup](#team-setup) — manage plugins in your own repo |
| **Org Admin** configuring security | [Organization Setup](#organization-setup) — control what's allowed org-wide |
| Exploring **plugins** | [Plugin Marketplace](https://scc-cli.dev/plugins/marketplace/) — official plugins & safety tools |

---

### Developer Onboarding

**New to a team?** After running `scc setup` and `scc start`, you get:

- **Your team's approved plugins and MCP servers** — pre-configured and ready
- **Organization security policies** — applied automatically, no action needed
- **Command guardrails** — block destructive git commands like `push --force` (when scc-safety-net plugin is enabled)
- **Isolated git worktrees** — your main branch stays clean while Claude experiments
- **Personal profiles (optional)** — save your own plugin/MCP preferences per project

**What you never need to do:**
- Edit config files manually
- Download or configure plugins
- Worry about security settings

Your org admin and team lead handle the configuration. You just code.

---

### Who Controls What

| Setting | Org Admin | Team Lead | Developer |
|---------|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Block dangerous plugins/servers | ✅ **Sets** | ❌ Cannot override | ❌ Cannot override |
| Default plugins for all teams | ✅ **Sets** | — | — |
| Team-specific plugins | ✅ Approves | ✅ **Chooses** | — |
| Project-local config (.scc.yaml) | ✅ Can restrict | ✅ Can restrict | ✅ **Extends** |
| Personal profiles (local) | ✅ Governed by security blocks | ✅ Governed by delegation | ✅ **Chooses** |
| Safety-net policy (block/warn) | ✅ **Sets** | ❌ Cannot override | ❌ Cannot override |

Organization security blocks cannot be overridden by teams or developers.

*"Approves" = teams can only select from org-allowed marketplaces; blocks always apply. "Extends" = can add plugins/settings, cannot remove org defaults.*

### Enforcement Scope (v1)

- SCC enforces org-managed plugins and MCP servers at runtime.
- MCP servers in repo `.mcp.json` or plugin bundles are outside SCC enforcement scope (block the plugin to restrict).
- `network_policy` is partially enforced (proxy env injection + MCP suppression under isolated), not a full egress firewall.
- `session.auto_resume` is advisory only in v1.

---

### Organization Setup

Org admins create a single JSON config that controls security for all teams:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0.0",
  "organization": { "name": "Acme Corp", "id": "acme" },
  "marketplaces": {
    "sandboxed-code-official": {
      "source": "github",
      "owner": "CCimen",
      "repo": "sandboxed-code-plugins"
    }
  },
  "security": {
    "blocked_plugins": ["*malicious*"],
    "blocked_mcp_servers": ["*.untrusted.com"],
    "safety_net": { "action": "block" }
  },
  "defaults": {
    "allowed_plugins": ["*"],
    "network_policy": "unrestricted"
  },
  "profiles": {
    "backend": { "additional_plugins": ["scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official"] },
    "frontend": { "additional_plugins": ["scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official"] }
  }
}
```

Host this anywhere: GitHub, GitLab, S3, or any HTTPS URL. Private repos work with token auth.

See [examples/](examples/) for complete org configs and [Governance](https://scc-cli.dev/architecture/governance-model/) for delegation rules.

---

### Team Setup

Teams can manage their plugins **two ways**:

**Option A: Inline (simple)** — Team config lives in the org config file.
```json
"profiles": {
  "backend": {
    "additional_plugins": ["scc-safety-net@sandboxed-code-official"]
  }
}
```

**Option B: Team Repo (GitOps)** — Team maintains their own config repo.
```json
"profiles": {
  "backend": {
    "config_source": {
      "source": "github",
      "owner": "acme",
      "repo": "backend-team-scc-config"
    }
  }
}
```

With Option B, team leads can update plugins via PRs to their own repo—no org admin approval needed for allowed additions.

**Config precedence:** Org defaults → Team profile → Project `.scc.yaml` (additive merge; blocks apply after merge).

---

### Personal Profiles

Want your own plugins or MCP servers without committing anything? Personal profiles are per‑project, stored outside the repo, and auto‑applied on `scc start`.

If you install plugins inside the container and they only show up in sandbox settings, `scc profile save` and `scc profile status` will detect them and offer to import them into `.claude/settings.local.json` before saving.

```bash
# Save current workspace preferences
scc profile save

# Apply or preview
scc profile apply
scc profile apply --preview

# Check status/drift
scc profile status
```

**TUI Integration:** Press `p` in the dashboard or go to **Settings → Profiles** for visual profile management:
- Save/Apply/Diff profiles without CLI commands
- **Sync profiles** overlay for export/import to a local folder
- Import preview shows what will change before applying

**Sync across machines:**

```bash
# Via TUI: Settings → Profiles → Sync profiles
# Or via CLI with git operations:
scc profile export --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles --commit --push
scc profile sync --repo ~/dotfiles/scc-profiles --pull --commit --push
```

> **Note:** TUI sync writes files locally only (no git). Use CLI flags `--commit --push` for git operations.

### Git Worktrees

**Primary method (no shell config needed):**

```bash
scc worktree enter feature-auth   # Opens a subshell in the worktree
# Type 'exit' to return to your previous directory
```

**Power users:** Add this shell wrapper for seamless `cd` switching:

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
wt() {
  local p
  p="$(scc worktree switch "$@")" || return $?
  cd "$p" || return 1
}
```

**Usage examples (both methods):**

```bash
scc worktree enter ^        # Enter main branch worktree
scc worktree enter -        # Enter previous worktree (like cd -)
wt feature-auth             # Switch with shell wrapper
wt scc/feature-x            # Match by full branch name
```

**Note:** Branch names with `/` are sanitized to `-` (e.g., `feature/auth` → `feature-auth`).

**Status indicators in `list -v`:**

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `+N` | N staged files |
| `!N` | N modified files |
| `?N` | N untracked files |
| `.` | Clean worktree |
| `…` | Status timed out |

**Cleanup stale entries:**

```bash
scc worktree prune -n   # Dry-run: show what would be pruned
scc worktree prune      # Actually prune stale entries
```

---

## Configuration

### Setup Modes

**Organization mode** (recommended):
```bash
scc setup
# Enter URL when prompted: https://gitlab.example.org/devops/scc-config.json
```

**Standalone mode** (no org config):
```bash
scc setup --standalone
```

### Project Config

Add `.scc.yaml` to your repository root for project-specific settings:

```yaml
additional_plugins:
  - "project-linter@internal"

session:
  timeout_hours: 4
```

### File Locations

```
~/.config/scc/config.json    # Org URL, team, preferences
~/.cache/scc/                # Cache (safe to delete)
<repo>/.scc.yaml             # Project-specific config
```

Run `scc config paths` to see all locations with sizes and permissions.

---

## Troubleshooting

Run `scc doctor` to diagnose issues.

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Docker not reachable | Start Docker Desktop |
| Organization config fetch failed | Check URL and token |
| Plugin blocked | Check `scc config explain` for security blocks |

See [Troubleshooting Guide](https://scc-cli.dev/troubleshooting/) for more solutions.

## Automation & CI

SCC supports non-interactive operation for CI/CD pipelines and scripting.

```bash
# CI pipeline example
scc start --non-interactive --team backend ~/project

# Preview configuration as JSON
scc start --dry-run --json

# Full automation mode
scc start --dry-run --json --non-interactive ~/project
```

**Key flags:**
- `--non-interactive` — Fail fast instead of prompting
- `--json` — Machine-readable output with standardized envelope
- `--dry-run` — Preview configuration without launching

**Exit codes:** 0 (success), 2 (usage error), 3 (config error), 4 (tool error), 5 (prerequisites), 6 (governance block), 130 (cancelled)

See [CLI Reference → Exit Codes](https://scc-cli.dev/reference/cli/overview/#exit-codes) for complete documentation.
