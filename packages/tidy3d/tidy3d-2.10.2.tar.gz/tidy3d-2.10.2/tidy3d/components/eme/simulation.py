    Notes
    -----

        EME is a frequency-domain method for propagating the electromagnetic field along a
        specified axis. The method is well-suited for propagation of guided waves.
        The electromagnetic fields are expanded locally in the basis of eigenmodes of the
        waveguide; they are then propagated by imposing continuity conditions in this basis.

        The EME simulation is performed along the propagation axis ``axis`` at frequencies ``freqs``.
        The simulation is divided into cells along the propagation axis, as defined by
        ``eme_grid_spec``. Mode solving is performed at cell centers, and boundary conditions are
        imposed between cells. The EME ports are defined to be the boundaries of the first and last
        cell in the EME grid. These can be moved using ``port_offsets``.

        An EME simulation always computes the full scattering matrix of the structure.
        Additional data can be recorded by adding 'monitors' to the simulation.

        **Other Bases**

        By default, the scattering matrix is expressed in the basis of EME modes at the two ports. It is sometimes useful to use alternative bases. For example, in a waveguide splitter, we might want the scattering matrix in the basis of modes of the individual waveguides. The functions `smatrix_in_basis` and `field_in_basis` in :class:`.EMESimulationData` can be used for this purpose after the simulation has been run.

        **Frequency Sweeps**

        Frequency sweeps are supported by including multiple frequencies in the `freqs` field. To avoid recomputing the modes at each frequency, the modes are interpolated according to the `EMEModeSpec.interp_spec` in the cells `eme_grid_spec`. By setting this `interp_spec`, the interpolation can be changed or disabled (repeating the solve at each frequency, which can be slow).

        **Passivity and Unitarity Constraints**

        Passivity and unitarity constraints can be imposed via the `constraint` field. These constraints are imposed at interfaces between cells, possibly at the expense of field continuity. Passivity means that the interface can only dissipate energy, and unitarity means the interface will conserve energy (energy may still be dissipated inside cells when the propagation constant is complex). Adding constraints can slow down the simulation significantly, especially for a large number of modes (more than 30 or 40).

        **Too Many Modes**

        It is important to use enough modes to capture the physics of the device and to ensure that the results have converged (see below). However, using too many modes can slow down the simulation and result in numerical issues. If too many modes are used, it is common to see a warning about invalid modes in the simulation log. While these modes are not included in the EME propagation, this can indicate some other issue with the setup, especially if the results have not converged. In this case, extending the simulation size in the transverse directions and increasing the grid resolution may help by creating more valid modes that can be used in convergence testing.

        **Mode Convergence Sweeps**

        It is a good idea to check that the number of modes is large enough by running a mode convergence sweep. This can be done using :class:`.EMEModeSweep`.

    >>> waveguide_size = (lambda0/2, lambda0, inf)
    >>> waveguide = Structure(
    ...     geometry=Box(center=(0,0,0), size=waveguide_size),

        Same as in :class:`.AbstractYeeGridSimulation`, except also restricting EME grid.

        Parameters
        ----------
        region : :class:`.Box`
            New simulation domain.
        grid_spec : :class:`.GridSpec` = None
            New grid specification. If ``None``, then it is inherited from the original
            simulation. If ``identical``, then the original grid is transferred directly as a
            :class:`.CustomGrid`. Note that in the latter case the region of the new simulation is
            snapped to the original grid lines.
        eme_grid_spec: :class:`.EMEGridSpec` = None
            New EME grid specification. If ``None``, then it is inherited from the original
            simulation. If ``identical``, then the original grid is transferred directly as a
            :class:`.EMEExplicitGrid`. Noe that in the latter case the region of the new simulation
            is expanded to contain full EME cells.
        symmetry : Tuple[Literal[0, -1, 1], Literal[0, -1, 1], Literal[0, -1, 1]] = None
            New simulation symmetry. If ``None``, then it is inherited from the original
            simulation. Note that in this case the size and placement of new simulation domain
            must be commensurate with the original symmetry.
        warn_symmetry_expansion : bool = True
            Whether to warn when the subsection is expanded to preserve symmetry.
        monitors : Tuple[MonitorType, ...] = None
            New list of monitors. If ``None``, then the monitors intersecting the new simulation
            domain are inherited from the original simulation.
        remove_outside_structures : bool = True
            Remove structures outside of the new simulation domain.
        remove_outside_custom_mediums : bool = True
            Remove custom medium data outside of the new simulation domain.
        **kwargs
            Other arguments passed to new simulation instance.
