    Notes
    -----
        Useful for simulating long periodic structures like Bragg gratings,
        as it allows the EME solver to reuse the modes and cell interface
        scattering matrices.

        Compared to setting ``num_reps`` directly in the ``eme_grid_spec``,
        this sweep spec allows varying the number of repetitions,
        effectively simulating multiple structures in a single EME simulation.

    Example
    -------
    >>> n_list = [1, 50, 100]
    >>> sweep_spec = EMEPeriodicitySweep(num_reps=[{"unit_cell": n} for n in n_list])
