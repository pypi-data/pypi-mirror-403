     Notes
     -----

        For the injection to work as expected (i.e. to reproduce the required ``E`` and ``H`` fields),
        the field data must decay by the edges of the source plane, or the source plane must span the entire
        simulation domain and the fields must match the simulation boundary conditions.

        The equivalent source currents are fully defined by the field components tangential to the
        source plane. For e.g. source normal along ``z``, the normal components (``Ez`` and ``Hz``)
        can be provided but will have no effect on the results, and at least one of the tangential
        components has to be in the dataset, i.e. at least one of ``Ex``, ``Ey``, ``Hx``, and ``Hy``.

        .. TODO add image here

        ..
            TODO is this generic? Only the field components tangential to the custom source plane are needed and used
            in the simulation. Due to the equivalence principle, these fully define the currents that need to be
            injected. This is not to say that the normal components of the data (:math:`E_x`, :math:`H_x` in our example)
            is lost or not injected. It is merely not needed as it can be uniquely obtained using the tangential components.

        ..
            TODO add example for this standalone
            Source data can be imported from file just as shown here, after the data is imported as a numpy array using
            standard numpy functions like loadtxt.

        If the data is not coming from a ``tidy3d`` simulation, the normalization is likely going to be arbitrary and
        the directionality of the source will likely not be perfect, even if both the ``E`` and ``H`` fields are
        provided. An empty normalizing run may be needed to accurately normalize results.

        To create this empty simulation it is recommended that users create a simulation with no structures but just a flux
        monitor (``tidy3D.FluxMonitor``) next to the custom source, ensuring that the flux monitor is at least one grid cell
        away from the source. Moreover, for accurate normalization, users must ensure that the same grid is used to run
        the original simulation as well as the empty simulation. The total flux calculated at the flux monitor of the empty
        simulation can then be used for proper normalization of results after ``tidy3d`` simulation.

        The coordinates of all provided fields are assumed to be relative to the source center.
        If only the ``E`` or only the ``H`` fields are provided, the source will not be directional,
        but will inject equal power in both directions instead.

    Notes
    -----

        Using this mode source, it is possible selectively excite one of the guided modes of a waveguide. This can be
        computed in our eigenmode solver :class:`tidy3d.plugins.mode.ModeSolver` and implement the mode simulation in
        FDTD.

        Mode sources are normalized to inject exactly 1W of power at the central frequency.

        The modal source allows you to do directional excitation. Illustrated
        by the image below, the field is perfectly launched to the right of the source and there's zero field to the
        left of the source. Now you can contrast the behavior of the modal source with that of a dipole source. If
        you just put a dipole into the waveguide, well, you see quite a bit different in the field distribution.
        First of all, the dipole source is not directional launching. It launches waves in both directions. The
        second is that the polarization of the dipole is set to selectively excite a TE mode. But it takes some
        propagation distance before the mode settles into a perfect TE mode profile. During this process,
        there is radiation into the substrate.

class TFSF(AngledFieldSource, VolumeSource, BroadbandSource):
    """Total-field scattered-field (TFSF) source that can inject a plane wave in a finite region.

    Notes
    -----

        The TFSF source injects :math:`1 W` of power per :math:`\\mu m^2` of source area along the :attr:`injection_axis`.
        Hence, the normalization for the incident field is :math:`|E_0|^2 = \\frac{2}{c\\epsilon_0}`, for any source size.
        Note that in the case of angled incidence, the same power is injected along the source's :attr:`injection_axis`,
        and not the propagation direction. This allows computing scattering and absorption cross-sections
        without the need for additional normalization.

        The TFSF source allows specifying a box region into which a plane wave is injected. Fields inside this region
        can be interpreted as the superposition of the incident field and the scattered field due to any scatterers
        present in the simulation domain. The fields at the edges of the TFSF box are modified at each time step such
        that the incident field is cancelled out, so that all fields outside the TFSF box are scattered fields only.
        This is useful in scenarios where one is interested in computing scattered fields only, for example when
        computing scattered cross-sections of various objects.

        It is important to note that when a non-uniform grid is used in the directions transverse to the
        :attr:`injection_axis` of the TFSF source, the suppression of the incident field outside the TFSF box may not be as
        close to zero as in the case of a uniform grid. Because of this, a warning may be issued when nonuniform grid
        TFSF setup is detected. In some cases, however, the accuracy may be only weakly affected, and the warnings
        can be ignored.
