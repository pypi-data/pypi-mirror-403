# You can use these placeholders in the "location" of each item:
# $HOME: the home directory
# $CONFIG_DIR: refers to "$HOME/.config/"
# $SHARE_DIR: refers to "$HOME/.local/share"
# $BIN_DIR: refers to "$HOME/.local/bin"
# ${ENDS_WITH="text"}: for folders with different names on different computers whose names end with the same thing.
# The best example for this is the "*.default-release" folder of firefox.
# ${BEGINS_WITH="text"}: for folders with different names on different computers whose names start with the same thing.
