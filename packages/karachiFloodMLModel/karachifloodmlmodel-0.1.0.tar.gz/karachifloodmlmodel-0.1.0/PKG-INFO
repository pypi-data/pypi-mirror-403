This project was a product of the Youth Innovation Challenge: Code for Climate, at the IPN Summit in Houston in 2025. 
Here, I have designed a Random Forest machine-learning model that takes weather data for the last three months,
as well as from the flooding in Karachi in 2025 to make predictions on if there is a live risk of flooding. This
is possible because of the OpenMeteo API, which provides hourly conditions. Our predictions are made based on atmospheric pressure,
precipitation, and humidity trends.
