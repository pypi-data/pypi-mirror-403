[project.scripts]
# For a set of tools, you have two main options:
# 1. Organize them as subcommands under the main 'pymcce' CLI umbrella (recommended for related functionality).
#    This keeps everything accessible via 'pymcce <tool>', using Typer or Click for subcommand routing.
# 2. Register each tool as an independent script in [project.scripts], e.g.:
#    tool1 = "pymcce.tools.tool1:app"
#    tool2 = "pymcce.tools.tool2:app"
#    This makes each tool available as a separate command.
#
# Choose based on user experience and how tightly integrated the tools are.
