# Python Framework for DSGE Models
 
## Authors: Alexei Goumilevski and James Otterson
 
## What it is:
This Framework is designed to assist economists in the development and execution of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models within a Python environment.

## Installation:

Users are advised to create a virtual environment in Python to isolate this installation and its packages from the system-wide Python installation and other virtual environments. There are three options to install the “Snowdrop” package:

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local drive. Then install the necessary packages and libraries for this project.
   The following commands illustrate an example: <br />
   cd to_your_working_directory <br />
   git clone https:/github.com/gumilevskij/Framework.git <br />
   python -m venv env <br />
   source env/bin/activate <br />
   pip install -r Framework/requirements.txt
3. Run the command: pip install snowdrop-1.0.6-py3-none-any.whl --user
4. Install *Snowdrop* via pip installer: pip install pysnowdrop --upgrade
 
 ## How to run:
 - Create or modify existing YAML model file in the supplements/models folder.
 - Open tests/test_toy_models.py file and set *fname* to the name of the model file.
 - Run simulations in the Spyder IDE by double-clicking the run button or execute the Python script in a command prompt.

## Content:
 - Sample model file (see `<supplements/models/Toy/JLMP98.yaml>`)
 - Documentation (see `<supplements/docs/UserGuide.pdf>`)

## Highlights:
- The Framework is written in Python and utilizes only Python libraries available through the Anaconda distribution.
- It is versatile in parsing model files written in human-readable YAML format, Sirius XML format, as well as simple IRIS and DYNARE model files.
- Prototype model files are available for both non-linear and linear perfect-foresight models.
- The Framework can be executed as a batch process, in a Jupyter notebook, or within a Spyder interactive development environment (Scientific Python Development environment).
- It parses the model file, checks syntax for errors, and generates source code for Python functions, computing the Jacobian up to the third order in symbolic form.
- Non-linear equations are solved iteratively using Newton's method. Two algorithms are implemented: ABLR stacked matrices method and LBJ forward-backward substitution method.
- Linear models are solved using Binder and Pesaran's method, Anderson and More's method, and two generalized Schur methods that replicate calculations used in Dynare and Iris.
- Non-linear models can be executed with time-dependent parameters.
- The Framework can be employed to calibrate models to identify model parameters. Calibration can be performed for both linear and non-linear models, applying a Bayesian approach to maximize the likelihood function that incorporates prior beliefs about parameters and the model's goodness of fit to the data.
- It can sample model parameters using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo affine invariant ensemble sampler algorithm developed by Jonathan Goodman.
- The Framework utilizes the Scientific Python Sparse package for algebra with large matrices.
- Several filters have been implemented, including Kalman (for linear and non-linear models), Unscented Kalman, LRX, HP, Bandpass, and Particle filters. Multiple versions of Kalman filter and smoother algorithms have been developed, including diffuse and non-diffuse, as well as multivariate and univariate filters and smoothers.
- As a result of the runs, the Framework generates one- and two-dimensional plots and saves data in Excel files and in a Python SQLite database.
