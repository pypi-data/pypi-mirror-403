## Modern Python framework for functional programming with structured concurrency

Haiway brings functional programming principles to Python's async ecosystem, providing a robust
foundation for building scalable, maintainable applications with immutable state management and
automatic resource cleanup.

## Why Haiway?

Building concurrent Python applications often involves complex state management, dependency
injection frameworks, and careful resource handling. Haiway simplifies these challenges through:

### 🔒 **Immutability First**

Type-safe data structures that prevent race conditions and ensure predictable behavior in concurrent
environments

### ⚡ **Zero-Config DI**

Context-based dependency injection without decorators, containers, or complex frameworks

### 🎯 **Functional Design**

Pure functions and explicit data flow make code easier to understand, test, and maintain

### 🔄 **Structured Concurrency**

Automatic task lifecycle management with guaranteed cleanup, even in error cases

## Core Principles

### 🎯 **Type Safety Throughout**

Full type checking with modern Python features - unions, generics, protocols. Runtime validation
ensures data integrity.

### 🧩 **Composable Building Blocks**

Small, focused components that combine into larger systems. No framework lock-in or magic.

### 🔄 **Explicit Over Implicit**

Dependencies are visible in type signatures. No hidden global state or surprising side effects.

### 🎭 **Async-Native**

Built for Python's async/await from the ground up. Includes utilities for retries, timeouts, and
concurrent operations.

## 🖥️ Install

With pip:

```bash
pip install haiway
```
