    The function splits text at sentence boundaries (periods, question marks, exclamation points)
    to create natural-sounding chunks. If a sentence is too long, it falls back to
    splitting at commas, then spaces.

    Args:
        text: The text to split.
        max_length: Maximum character length for each chunk (default 4000 to provide buffer).

    Returns:
        List of text chunks, each below the maximum length.
