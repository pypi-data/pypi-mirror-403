INSTRUCTION="Find and update the changelog file to add version $VERSION. Here are the commits since the last release:

$COMMITS

Please:
1. Locate the changelog file (it might be CHANGELOG.md, CHANGELOG.rst, HISTORY.md, or similar)
2. Add a new entry at the top of the changelog for version $VERSION dated $CURRENT_DATE. Note that changelog header should be of format: ## [MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH] - YYYY-MM-DD. There should be an empty line before and after the version header.
3. Group the commits into appropriate sections (Added, Fixed, Improved, Infrastructure, etc.) based on their content. These should all be ### headers.
4. Clean up and standardize the commit messages to be more readable
5. Maintain the existing changelog format

Do NOT remove any existing entries.

Note that not all housekeeping updates need to be mentioned. Only those changes that a user would be interested in should be included.

Elements that should be more included and described:
- API endpoints
- Changes in memory behavior
- User facing improvements
- Major documentation updates

When describing these, think about why a user might care about the change, what they might expect as a result of the change.

Elements that should be excluded:
- Housekeeping items, minor documentation improvements
- Blog posts (these are released to docs ahead of release)
- pre-commit changes
