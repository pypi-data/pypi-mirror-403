## Elroy from your terminal

![Remember Command](images/remember_command.gif)

Elroy runs in your terminal helps you with reminders while maintaining memory of your interactions. As you chat with Elroy, it automatically:

1. **Creates memories** of important information
2. **Recalls relevant context** when needed
3. **Tracks reminders** you set together
4. **Consolidates redundant information** to keep context clean

## Quickstart

Run the install script:
```
curl -LsSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elroy-bot/elroy/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Ensure your env has `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY` or whatever model provider token you wish to use is set.

```bash
# Start the chat interface
elroy

# Run with a specific model
elroy --chat-model "gemini/gemini-2.0-flash"

# To see more detailed CLI options
elroy --help
```

## Slash Commands

![Slash Commands](images/slash_commands.gif)

Elroy's CLI supports slash commands for quick actions. Some examples (run `/help` to see the full list):

```bash
# Create a memory
/create_memory This is important information I want to save

# Create a reminder
/create_reminder Learn how to use Elroy effectively

# Process a single message and exit
elroy message "Say hello world"

# Force use of a specific tool
elroy message "Create a reminder" --tool create_reminder
```

## Scripting with Elroy

Elroy can be used in scripts and automated workflows:

```python
from elroy import Elroy

ai = Elroy()

# Create a memory
ai.remember("Important project context")

# Process a message with memory augmentation
response = ai.message("What should I do next on the project?")
print(response)
```

## Supported Models

Elroy works with:

- **OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1, o1-mini
- **Anthropic**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus
- **Google**: Gemini
- Any OpenAI-compatible API

Under the hood, Elroy uses [LiteLLM](https://www.litellm.ai/) to interface with model providers.
