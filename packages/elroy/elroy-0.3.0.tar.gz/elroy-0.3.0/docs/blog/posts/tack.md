title: Tack - Reminders powered by local AI

I'm working on an iPhone app called Tack. I have a terrible time remembering things, and have resorted to a patchwork of emails to myself and disorganized notes. I find reminder apps frustrating, the pre-AI ones aren't smart enough, and the AI ones treat every input like an invitation to have a conversation. Tack shoots for a middle ground:

I get the _ick_ from divulging personal details to LLM providers, so Tack uses local AI models (using Apple's on device Apple Intelligence).

The project is ready for test users! If you're interested in trying it out, please fill out the form below!
