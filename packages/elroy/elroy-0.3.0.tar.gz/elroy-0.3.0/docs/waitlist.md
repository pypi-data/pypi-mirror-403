Tack is a new iPhone app for reminders powered by local AI. It uses Apple's on-device Apple Intelligence to help you remember things without sending your personal information to cloud services.

## About Tack

I have a terrible time remembering things, and have resorted to a patchwork of emails to myself and disorganized notes. I find reminder apps frustrating - the pre-AI ones aren't smart enough, and the AI ones treat every input like an invitation to have a conversation. Tack shoots for a middle ground: smart enough to understand natural language, but focused on just creating reminders quickly.

The project is ready for test users! If you're interested in trying it out, please fill out the form below.
