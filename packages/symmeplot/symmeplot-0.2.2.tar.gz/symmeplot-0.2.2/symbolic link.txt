Played around a bit today with setting up a python project, thought I quickly share some nice tutorial posts:

- [A huge recent tutorial on setting up a python project](https://johschmidt42.medium.com/setting-up-python-projects-part-i-408603868c08), inspired by [hypermodern python](https://medium.com/@cjolowicz/hypermodern-python-d44485d9d769) and [Best practices for a New Project in 2021](https://medium.com/@cjolowicz/hypermodern-python-d44485d9d769). It unfortunately does not use `Ruff` yet.
- [A documentation tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/advanced-code-documentation-beyond-comments-and-docstrings-2cc5b2ace28a) has a few nice things especially in the second part.
- [Short tutorial which combines `Ruff` and `Black`](http://blog.pamelafox.org/2022/09/how-i-setup-python-project.html)
- [Tutorial if you want to automate your API documentation](https://bylr.info/articles/2022/05/10/api-doc-with-sphinx-autoapi/). Personally I'm not using this as it is probably really good if you understand it, but it is too much automation (not sure how to say it).
