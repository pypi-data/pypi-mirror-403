# Gonzo Card Games

Library to create virtualizations of card games with a standard deck 52 card deck(s).

## Background

The creation of this library was done as a learning exercise and as such is in an alpha state. The modules currently avaiable are intended to
be the core modules needed to expand this library to include many different card games. The CardDeck module has all functionality required to
manipulate/create individual playing cards and full card decks. The RatScrew module is an example of what virtualization of a card game can look like.
Lastly, the Templates module was added to give a starting a point of adding new modules for other card games, where each card game module would have the
same API calls for getting a games rules, controls, and for initiating play.

## Installation

python -m pip install gonzo-card-games
