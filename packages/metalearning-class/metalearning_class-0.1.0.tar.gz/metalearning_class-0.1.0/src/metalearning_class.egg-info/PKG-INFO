        - shall be governed byfollow the challenges rules or terms and conditions of Sofon platform.
        
        7.4. Any model whose **weights, metadata, or architecture** that are submitted to Panaceia\
        must follow the challenges rules or terms and conditions of Sofon platform upon submission or upload.

        - third-party meta-learning servers,
        - AutoML frameworks with backend components,
        - other model selection or model marketplace systems.
        
        8.2. The Library may be used with other ML libraries **only locally**, and only if not used to feed or integrate another meta-learning backend.
        
        ---
        
        # 9. Termination
        
        Violation of any clause automatically terminates this License.\

# Metalearning Library

## Project Purpose and Goals

This project provides a Python library for metalearning, focusing on developing and applying advanced machine learning techniques that learn how to learn. The primary goal is to offer a robust and extensible framework for building metalearning models, particularly those leveraging neural networks and transformer architectures, to solve complex regression and classification problems more efficiently and generalize better across various tasks.

The library aims to:
*   Facilitate the development of metalearning algorithms.
*   Provide implementations of key metalearning components (e.g., meta-learners, task encoders).
*   Enable rapid experimentation with different metalearning approaches.
*   Support diverse applications by providing flexible model structures.


## Basic Usage Examples

Here's a simple example of how you might use a hypothetical `MetalearningModel` class:

```python

import metalearning_class as mtl
import pandas as pd
# Other imports

# Import data from a Sofon challenge
train_data = ml.subscribe_and_get_task("taskname")

# Example: simple feature and target separation
x = df.drop(columns=['Target_id'])
y = df['Target_id']

# Initialize the metalearning model
ml = mtl.Metalearning(gpu=False)

# Login and get token with your Sofon account
ml.login("username", "password")

# Train the model (this is highly dependent on the actual implementation)

[...]


```


## Contribution
We soon will become open-source, and welcome contributions to the Metalearning Library!
