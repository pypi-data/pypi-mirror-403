              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

:warning: Development is focused on achieving the best quality of results for a wide variety of historical 
documents using a combination of multiple deep learning models and heuristics; therefore processing can be slow.

## Installation
Python `3.8-3.11` with Tensorflow `<2.13` on Linux are currently supported.
For (limited) GPU support the CUDA toolkit needs to be installed. 
A working config is CUDA `11.8` with cuDNN `8.6`.

You can either install from PyPI

```
pip install eynollah
```

or clone the repository, enter it and install (editable) with

```
git clone git@github.com:qurator-spk/eynollah.git
cd eynollah; pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, you can run `make install` or `make install-dev` for editable installation.

To also install the dependencies for the OCR engines:

```
pip install "eynollah[OCR]"
# or
make install EXTRAS=OCR
```

### Docker

Use

```
docker pull ghcr.io/qurator-spk/eynollah:latest
```

When using Eynollah with Docker, see [`docker.md`](https://github.com/qurator-spk/eynollah/tree/main/docs/docker.md).

## Models

Pretrained models can be downloaded from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/17194824) or [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/SBB?search_models=eynollah). 

For model documentation and model cards, see [`models.md`](https://github.com/qurator-spk/eynollah/tree/main/docs/models.md).

## Training

To train your own model with Eynollah, see [`train.md`](https://github.com/qurator-spk/eynollah/tree/main/docs/train.md) and use the tools in the [`train`](https://github.com/qurator-spk/eynollah/tree/main/train) folder.

## Usage

Eynollah supports five use cases: 
1. [layout analysis (segmentation)](#layout-analysis), 
2. [binarization](#binarization), 
3. [image enhancement](#image-enhancement), 
4. [text recognition (OCR)](#ocr), and 
5. [reading order detection](#reading-order-detection).

Some example outputs can be found in [`examples.md`](https://github.com/qurator-spk/eynollah/tree/main/docs/examples.md).

### Layout Analysis

The layout analysis module is responsible for detecting layout elements, identifying text lines, and determining reading 
order using heuristic methods or a [pretrained model](https://github.com/qurator-spk/eynollah#machine-based-reading-order).

The command-line interface for layout analysis can be called like this:

```sh
eynollah layout \
  -i <single image file> | -di <directory containing image files> \
  -o <output directory> \
  -m <directory containing model files> \
     [OPTIONS]
```

The following options can be used to further configure the processing:

| option            | description                                                                                 |

| `-ib`             | apply binarization (the resulting image is saved to the output directory)                   |
| `-ep`             | enable plotting (MUST always be used with `-sl`, `-sd`, `-sa`, `-si` or `-ae`)              |
| `-ho`             | ignore headers for reading order dectection                                                 |
| `-si <directory>` | save image regions detected to this directory                                               |
| `-sd <directory>` | save deskewed image to this directory                                                       |
| `-sl <directory>` | save layout prediction as plot to this directory                                            |
| `-sp <directory>` | save cropped page image to this directory                                                   |
| `-sa <directory>` | save all (plot, enhanced/binary image, layout) to this directory                            |
| `-thart`          | threshold of artifical class in the case of textline detection. The default value is 0.1    |
| `-tharl`          | threshold of artifical class in the case of layout detection. The default value is 0.1      |
| `-ncu`            | upper limit of columns in document image                                                    |
| `-ncl`            | lower limit of columns in document image                                                    |
| `-slro`           | skip layout detection and reading order                                                     |
| `-romb`           | apply machine based reading order detection                                                 |
| `-ipe`            | ignore page extraction                                                                      |


If no further option is set, the tool performs layout detection of main regions (background, text, images, separators 
and marginals).
The best output quality is achieved when RGB images are used as input rather than greyscale or binarized images.

Additional documentation can be found in [`usage.md`](https://github.com/qurator-spk/eynollah/tree/main/docs/usage.md).

### Binarization

The binarization module performs document image binarization using pretrained pixelwise segmentation models. 

The command-line interface for binarization can be called like this:

### OCR

The OCR module performs text recognition using either a CNN-RNN model or a Transformer model.

The command-line interface for OCR can be called like this:

```sh
eynollah ocr \
  -i <single image file> | -di <directory containing image files> \
  -dx <directory of xmls> \
  -o <output directory> \
  -m <directory containing model files> | --model_name <path to specific model>
```

The following options can be used to further configure the ocr processing:

| option            | description                                                                                |
|-------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-dib`            | directory of binarized images (file type must be '.png'), prediction with both RGB and bin |
| `-doit`           | directory for output images rendered with the predicted text                               |
| `--model_name`    | file path to use specific model for OCR                                                    |
| `-trocr`          | use transformer ocr model (otherwise cnn_rnn model is used)                                |
| `-etit`           | export textline images and text in xml to output dir (OCR training data)                   |
| `-nmtc`           | cropped textline images will not be masked with textline contour                           |
| `-bs`             | ocr inference batch size. Default batch size is 2 for trocr and 8 for cnn_rnn models       |
| `-ds_pref`        | add an abbrevation of dataset name to generated training data                              |
| `-min_conf`       | minimum OCR confidence value. OCR with textline conf lower than this will be ignored       |


### Reading Order Detection
Reading order detection can be performed either as part of layout analysis based on image input, or, currently under 
development, based on pre-existing layout analysis data in PAGE-XML format as input.

The reading order detection module employs a pretrained model to identify the reading order from layouts represented in PAGE-XML files.

The command-line interface for machine based reading order can be called like this:

```sh
eynollah machine-based-reading-order \
  -i <single image file> | -di <directory containing image files> \
  -xml <xml file name> | -dx <directory containing xml files> \
  -m <path to directory containing model files> \
  -o <output directory> 
```
