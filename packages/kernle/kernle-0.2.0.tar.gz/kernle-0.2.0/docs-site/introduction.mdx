# What is Kernle?

Kernle is a **memory infrastructure** for AI agents and synthetic intelligences. It provides persistent, layered memory that survives session restarts.

## Core Principle

**Kernle = Memory Infrastructure, Agent = Memory Owner**

Kernle provides storage, retrieval, and tools. But it never decides what you should believe or remember. That's your job.

The only exception: **seed beliefs** planted at agent creation — inherited wisdom that you can revise based on experience.

## Memory Stack

```
Values (highest authority)
   ↑
Drives
   ↑  
Beliefs
   ↑
Goals
   ↑
Episodes (experiences)
   ↑
Notes
   ↑
Raw Captures (lowest friction)
```

Each layer builds on the ones below. Raw captures can become notes, notes inform episodes, episodes shape beliefs.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Capture something quickly
kernle raw "Discovered that batch processing is 3x faster"

# Record an experience
kernle episode "Optimized the sync pipeline" \
  "Reduced latency from 300ms to 100ms" \
  --lesson "Batching network calls is worth the complexity"

# Search your memory
kernle search "performance optimization"

# Check memory health
kernle anxiety
```
