# Claude Desktop Integration

Claude Desktop supports MCP servers through a configuration file. This guide shows you how to add Kernle as a memory tool.

## Configuration File Location

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    ```
    ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```
    %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Linux">
    ```
    ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

Add Kernle to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kernle": {
      "command": "kernle",
      "args": ["mcp", "--agent", "claude"]
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
Replace `claude` with your preferred agent ID. This ID identifies your memory store.
</Warning>

### Full Configuration Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kernle": {
      "command": "kernle",
      "args": ["mcp", "--agent", "claude-desktop"]
    }
  }
}
```

### With Python Path (if needed)

If Kernle was installed via pip in a specific environment:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kernle": {
      "command": "/path/to/python",
      "args": ["-m", "kernle", "mcp", "--agent", "claude"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or with pipx:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kernle": {
      "command": "/Users/you/.local/bin/kernle",
      "args": ["mcp", "--agent", "claude"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Apply Configuration

1. Save the configuration file
2. **Completely quit Claude Desktop** (not just close the window)
3. Restart Claude Desktop

## Verify Installation

After restarting, you should see memory tools available. Try asking Claude:

> "Can you check my memory status?"

Claude should call the `memory_status` tool and return your memory overview.

## Available Tools

Once connected, Claude Desktop has access to:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| `memory_load` | Restore working memory at conversation start |
| `memory_checkpoint_save` | Save current state |
| `memory_episode` | Record an experience with lessons |
| `memory_note` | Capture notes, decisions, insights |
| `memory_raw` | Quick capture for later processing |
| `memory_search` | Search across all memory types |
| `memory_anxiety` | Check memory health |

## Recommended Workflow

### Starting a Conversation

Ask Claude to load memory first:

> "Please load your memory before we start."

This restores context from previous conversations.

### During Conversation

Claude can capture learnings as you work:

> "Remember that the API rate limit is 100 requests per minute."

### Ending a Conversation

Ask Claude to save state:

> "Please save a checkpoint before we wrap up."

## Troubleshooting

### Tools Not Showing

1. Check config file syntax (valid JSON)
2. Verify file location is correct
3. Ensure Kernle is in PATH: `which kernle`
4. Fully restart Claude Desktop

### "Command not found"

Use the full path to Kernle:

```bash
# Find the path
which kernle
```

Then use that path in the config.

### Permission Denied

Make sure the Kernle data directory exists and is writable:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kernle
chmod 755 ~/.kernle
```

### Checking Logs

Claude Desktop logs may show MCP connection errors:

    ```bash
    tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp.log

  <Tab title="Windows">
    Check Event Viewer or `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs`
  </Tab>
