## Upgrade Process

Kernle handles database migrations automatically when you upgrade. However, there are a few things to be aware of.

### Basic Upgrade

```bash
pip install --upgrade kernle
```

### pyenv Users

If you use pyenv to manage Python versions, you **must** rehash after upgrading:

```bash
pip install --upgrade kernle
pyenv rehash
```

Without `pyenv rehash`, your shell will continue using stale console script shims that point to the old version. You'll see symptoms like:
- New CLI flags not being recognized (e.g., `--budget`)
- `kernle --version` showing the old version even after upgrade
- `python -c "import kernle; print(kernle.__version__)"` showing the correct version

### Verifying the Upgrade

After upgrading, verify both the module and CLI are updated:

```bash
# Check module version
python -c "import kernle; print(kernle.__version__)"

# Check CLI version
kernle --version

# Both should show the same version
```

## Database Migrations

Kernle automatically migrates your local SQLite database when you run any command after upgrading. Migrations are non-destructive and preserve all existing data.

### 0.1.x → 0.2.0 Migration

The 0.2.0 release includes a significant raw layer refactor that changes how raw entries are stored:

| Old Schema (0.1.x) | New Schema (0.2.0) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `content` field | `blob` field (primary) |
| `timestamp` field | `captured_at` field |
| `tags` JSON array | Included in `blob` text |

**What happens automatically:**
1. The `blob` and `captured_at` columns are added to `raw_entries`
2. Existing `content` is migrated to `blob` with natural language formatting
3. Tags are appended to the blob text (e.g., `[tags: work, planning]`)
4. FTS5 full-text search index is created for fast keyword search

**Migration warning you might see:**

```
WARNING:kernle.storage.sqlite:Raw blob migration check failed: no such column: blob
```

This warning appears when the migration is in progress or needs to be triggered. It's non-blocking - Kernle will continue to work, but you should run a command to complete the migration.

### Triggering Migrations Manually

Migrations run automatically on any Kernle command. To explicitly trigger them:

```bash
# Any command will trigger migrations
kernle status

# Or check your agent's memory
kernle -a your_agent load
```

### Verifying Migration Success

After migration, the warning should disappear. You can also verify the raw layer is working:

```bash
# Test raw capture
kernle raw capture "test entry after migration"

# Test FTS5 search (new in 0.2.0)
kernle raw search "test"
```

## Troubleshooting Migration Issues

### "no such column: blob" Warning Persists

If the warning persists after running commands:

1. **Check SQLite version**: FTS5 requires SQLite 3.9.0+
   ```bash
   python -c "import sqlite3; print(sqlite3.sqlite_version)"
   ```

2. **Force schema recreation** (safe - won't delete data):
   ```bash
   # Backup first
   cp ~/.kernle/your_agent/memory.db ~/.kernle/your_agent/memory.db.backup

   # Run any command to re-trigger migrations
   kernle -a your_agent status
   ```

3. **Check file permissions**: Ensure the database file is writable
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.kernle/your_agent/memory.db
   ```

### FTS5 Search Not Working

If `kernle raw search` returns no results but you have raw entries:

1. The FTS5 index may need rebuilding. This happens automatically, but you can force it:
   ```bash
   kernle -a your_agent raw search "."  # Any search triggers index check
   ```

2. On older SQLite versions without FTS5, search falls back to LIKE queries (slower but functional).

### Rollback (Emergency Only)

If you need to rollback to a previous version:

```bash
pip install kernle==0.1.0
pyenv rehash  # if using pyenv
```

<Note>
Rollback is safe for data but new features won't be available. The database schema is backwards-compatible - old versions can read data created by new versions.
</Note>

| Version | Key Migration Changes |
