 Shaped API

 Welcome to Shaped's API reference docs. These provide a  detailed view of the endpoints and CLI commands that Shaped provides and brief  explanations of how they should be used.  The Shaped API has four main endpoints:  **Tables** - Provision and manage batch and real-time data connectors.   **Views** - Configure SQL transformations and AI enrichment on your input data. Use SQL to combine multiple data sources or use an LLM to add new categories, extract specific attributes from descriptions, etc.  **Engines** - Deploy and manage your relevance engines. The Engine API exposes configuration for indexing logic, input datasets, externam embeddings, and more.  **Query** - Execute queries against your engines, to return data based on an input query or rerank an existing list. The Query API exposes the retrieve, filter, score, and ranking steps of the 4-stage ranking architecture.  The base URL for each endpoint is: `https://api.shaped.ai/v2`
