<h1 align="center">jaxtyping</h1>

A library providing type annotations **and runtime type-checking** for the shape and dtype of JAX/PyTorch/NumPy/MLX/TensorFlow arrays and tensors.

_The name 'jax'typing is now historical, we support all of the above and have no JAX dependency!_

```python
from jaxtyping import Float
from torch import Tensor

# Accepts floating-point 2D arrays with matching axes
def matrix_multiply(x: Float[Tensor, "dim1 dim2"],
                    y: Float[Tensor, "dim2 dim3"]
                  ) -> Float[Tensor, "dim1 dim3"]:
    ...
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install jaxtyping
```

Requires Python 3.10+.

The annotations provided by jaxtyping are compatible with runtime type-checking packages, so it is common to also install one of these. The two most popular are [typeguard](https://github.com/agronholm/typeguard) (which exhaustively checks every argument) and [beartype](https://github.com/beartype/beartype) (which checks random pieces of arguments).
