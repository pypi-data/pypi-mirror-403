explanation: |
  This module has two modes: response and direct
  If in direct mode it will directly calculate the power spectra
  If in response mode it will calcualte the reponse of the hm to different power spectra with respect to P_mm
  and multiply that to an input P_mm to estimate the desired power, for example:
  res_gg = P^hm_gg/P^hm_mm
  res_gm = P^hm_gm/P^hm_mm
  Then uses these in combination with input matter power spectra, P_mm, to create 3D power for P_gg and P_gm
  P_gg = res_gg P_mm
  P_gm = res_gm P_mm

  The following exaplains how P^hm_xy are calculated.
  Calculates 3D power spectra using the halo model approach:
  See section 2 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08752.pdf for details

  P_uv = P^2h_uv + P^1h_uv  (1)
  P^1h_uv (k) = int_0^infty dM Wu(M, k) Wv(M, k) n(M)  (2)
  P^2h_uv (k) = int_0^infty int_0^infty dM1 dM2 Phh(M1, M2, k) Wu(M1, k) Wv(M2, k) n(M1) n(M2)  (3)

  Wx are the profile of the fields, u and v, showing how they fit into haloes.
  n(M) is the halo mass function, quantifying the number of haloes of each mass, M.
  Integrals are taken over halo mass.

  The halo-halo power spectrum can be written as,
  Phh(M1,M2,k) = b(M1) b(M2) P^lin_mm(k) (1 + beta_nl(M1,M2,k)) (4)

  In the vanilla halo model the 2-halo term is usually simplified by assuming that haloes are linearly biased with respect to matter.
  This sets beta_nl to zero and effectively decouples the integrals in (3). Here we allow for both options to be calculated.

  Linear matter power spectrum needs to be provided as well.

  Current power spectra that we predict are
  mm: matter-matter
  gg: galaxy-galaxy
  gm: galaxy-matter

  II: intrinsic-intrinsic alignments
  gI: galaxy-intrinsic alignment
  mI: matter-intrinsic alignment
