  # GitHub does not provide a "all status checks must pass" option
  # in branch protection settings. Instead, you have to specify exactly
  # what status checks want to require to pass before merging. However,
  # naming each individual check would be effectively impossible.
  # Therefore, by creating this stage in every repo in the org we can
  # require "Report Result" to pass before merging and this stage can
  # represent the result of the other checks where it only passes if
  # all the other checks pass.
