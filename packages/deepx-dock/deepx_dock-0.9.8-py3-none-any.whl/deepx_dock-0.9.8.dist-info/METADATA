*Modular, extensible bridge between first-principles calculations and the DeepH method*
</div>

*DeepH-dock* is a modular, extensible interface platform for quantum materials calculations, dedicated to building efficient and reliable bridges between first-principles calculations and the *DeepH (deep learning Hamiltonian) method*. This platform integrates multiple density functional theory (DFT) software interfaces, supports DeepH predictions, and provides standardized data processing. **It also functions independently as a post-processing tool for DFT calculations.**

At the core of *DeepH-dock* is **a unified and flexible interface layer that seamlessly connects mainstream DFT packages with the DeepH workflow**, enabling users to generate and utilize deep learning-based Hamiltonians with minimal effort. DeepH-dock offers first-class support for heterogeneous computational environments, allowing researchers to orchestrate complex multi-software workflows through a consistent Python API.

*DeepH-dock* also establishes [a unified data format tailored for machine learning in materials science](https://docs.deeph-pack.com/deeph-dock/en/latest/key_concepts.html), facilitating efficient implementations of both force fields and electronic structure methods.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community! To ensure a consistent and maintainable codebase, please follow the structured workflow below when adding new functionality.

### Development Workflow for Contributors

A brief summary is provided below. Complete documentation can be found in the [Development Guide](https://docs.deeph-pack.com/deeph-dock/en/latest/for_developers/development_guide.html).

1. **Identify the Target Module**

    First, determine which major module your contribution belongs to, based on the project architecture (e.g., `analyze`, `compute`, `convert`, `design`).

2. **Create Your Submodule**

    Create a new folder for your submodule within the corresponding parent module. For example, if you are implementing an interface between FHI-aims and DeepH, create it under `deepx_dock/convert/fhi_aims/`.

3. **Implement Your Functionality**

    Package the core logic you wish to add as a well-defined Python class or function. This makes the code reusable and easier to test.

4. **Register a Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

    **This is the most important step.** To expose your functionality through the main `dock` command, you must register your function inside the `_cli.py` file within your submodule directory.

    In this file, define your CLI command using the `click` library and the provided `@register` decorator.

**Example:**
If you create `deepx_dock/convert/fhi_aims/_cli.py` with the following content:

```python
import click
from pathlib import Path
from deepx_dock._cli.registry import register

@register(
    cli_name="my-func",
    cli_help="A brief description of what my-func does.",
    cli_args=[
        click.argument('fhiaims_dir', type=click.Path()),
        click.argument('deeph_dir', type=click.Path()),
        click.option(
            '--parallel-num', '-p', type=int, default=-1,
            help="The parallel processing number, -1 for using all of the cores."
        ),
    ],
)
def my_func(fhiaims_dir: Path, deeph_dir: Path, parallel_num: int):
    # Your implementation logic here
    from .my_wanderful_function import my_real_func
    my_real_func(fhiaims_dir, deeph_dir, parallel_num)
```

Then, on the user end, a new command will be available:

```bash
dock convert fhi-aims my-func
```

The command's usage (arguments, options, help text) is entirely defined by the `click` decorators specified in `cli_args`. Please refer to the [official click documentation](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) for details on defining arguments and options.
