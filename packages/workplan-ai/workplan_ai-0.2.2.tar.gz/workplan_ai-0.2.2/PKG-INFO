## 📘 Complete Command Guide

### 1. Planning your Week

    Shows your current goal, task statuses, total points, and Focus Score.

    Instantly revert to a previous plan from an automatic backup.

### 2. Daily Execution
*   **`workplan task <ID>` (Alias: `inspect`)**: 
    View full details, including **Daily Microtasks**.
*   **`workplan decompose <ID>`**:
    Uses AI to break a big task into 3-5 actionable daily steps.

## 💎 The "Corporate Rhythm" Philosophy
- **High Intent, Low Ceremony**: Spend 2 minutes planning on Monday, let the AI and Git hooks handle the tracking, and export your report on Friday.
- **Outcome Driven**: Every task generated is designed to result in a tangible technical artifact.
- **Professional Transparency**: Use the `Risk` and `Carryover` signals to manage expectations with your team before deadlines hit.
