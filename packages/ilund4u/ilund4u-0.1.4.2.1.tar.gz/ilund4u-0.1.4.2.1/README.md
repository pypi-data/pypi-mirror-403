**Programming language:** Python3   
**OS:** MacOS, Linux  
**Python dependencies:** biopython, bcbio-gff, scipy, configs, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, progess, leidanalg, igraph. pyhmmer, msa4u, lovis4u    
**Python version:** >= 3.8  
**OS-level dependencies:** MMseqs2 (included in the package)  
**License:** WTFPL  
**Version:** 0.1.4.2 (Jan 2026)

## Installation 

- iLund4u can be installed directly from pypi:

```
python3 -m pip install ilund4u
```

- The development version is available at github :

```
git clone https://github.com/art-egorov/ilund4u.git
cd ilund4u
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install setuptools wheel
python3 setup.py sdist
python3 -m pip install  .
```

**!** If you're a linux user, run `ilund4u --linux` post-install command once to update paths in the premade config files that set by default for MacOS users.

## Databases

<img src="docs/img/ilund4u_dbs_wo_header.png" align="right" width="400" max-width="100%" />

iLund4u has two precomputed databases of hotspots built on phage and plasmid sequences.  
The database of phages was built based on running hotspot annotation mode on all available [PhageScope database](https://phagescope.deepomics.org) sequences (~870K genomes, version of September 2024). For plasmids database we took [IMG/PR database of plasmids](https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/portal/IMG_PR/IMG_PR.home.html) (~700K sequences, version of June 2024).  


To download iLund4u database from [our server](https://data-sharing.atkinson-lab.com/iLund4u/) you can use the following argument: `--database <phages|plasmids>`. For example, to get plasmids database you need to run:  
```
ilund4u --database plasmids
```

**Database sizes (compressed):** Phages: 6.8GB; Plasmids: 1.3GB
