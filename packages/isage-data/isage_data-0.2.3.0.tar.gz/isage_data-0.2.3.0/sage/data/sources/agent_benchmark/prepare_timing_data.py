Prepare Timing Judgment Dataset

Generates synthetic data for timing detection benchmark:
- 500+ samples where tool calling IS needed (real-time info, actions, etc.)
- 500+ samples where tool calling is NOT needed (factual, conversational, etc.)

Output format: JSONL with fields:
- sample_id: Unique identifier
- message: User message text
- should_call_tool: Boolean ground truth
- direct_answer: Optional answer if no tool needed
- context: Optional conversation context
- category: Category for analysis

Default output: .sage/benchmark/data/timing_judgment/

Usage:
    python prepare_timing_data.py
    python prepare_timing_data.py --output /path/to/data --num-tool-needed 1000
