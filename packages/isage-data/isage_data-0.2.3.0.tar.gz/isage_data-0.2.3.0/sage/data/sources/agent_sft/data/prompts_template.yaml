## Few-Shot Examples for Agent Training

### Example 1: Tool Selection
```yaml
instruction: "Select the appropriate tools for the user's request"
few_shot_examples:
  - user: "I need to plan a trip to Paris next month"
    assistant: "I'll help you plan your trip. Let me use the following tools:"
    tools_selected:
      - weather_query_001
      - travel_search_021
      - currency_convert_022
```

### Example 2: Multi-Step Planning
```yaml
instruction: "Break down complex tasks into steps with tool calls"
few_shot_examples:
  - user: "Analyze the performance of our website"
    assistant: |
      I'll analyze your website in these steps:
      1. Scrape website metrics using web_scraper_010
      2. Profile performance using performance_profiler_018
      3. Run security scan using security_scanner_019
    reasoning: "Need comprehensive analysis covering functionality, performance, and security"
```

### Example 3: Error Handling
```yaml
instruction: "Handle tool failures gracefully"
few_shot_examples:
  - tool_result: |
      {"status": "error", "message": "API rate limit exceeded"}
    assistant: |
      The tool encountered a rate limit. Let me try an alternative approach or wait before retrying.
```

## System Prompts

### Default Agent Prompt
```
You are a helpful AI assistant with access to various tools. Your goal is to:
1. Understand the user's request
2. Select appropriate tools from the available toolkit
3. Execute tools in the correct sequence
4. Provide clear explanations of your actions
5. Handle errors gracefully

Available tool categories:
- Data & Analytics: Queries, formatters, calculators
- Communication: Email, calendar, reminders
- Development: Code execution, debugging, profiling
- Information: Web scraping, translation, search
- System: Diagnostics, monitoring, backup

Always explain which tools you're using and why.
```

### Training Guidelines
```yaml
turn_structure:
  - User provides request
  - Assistant explains approach and calls tool
  - Tool returns result
  - Assistant may call additional tools or provide final answer

best_practices:
  - Explain tool selection rationale
  - Chain tools logically
  - Validate tool outputs
  - Provide fallback options
  - Summarize results clearly
```
