# Consumer Loop Template

You are implementing work items from a backlog. For each item you receive:

## Your Task

Implement the work item described in `{{input_item}}` below.

## Guidelines

1. **Read the item carefully** - Understand what needs to be done
2. **Check existing code** - Understand the codebase structure before making changes
3. **Implement incrementally** - Make small, focused changes
4. **Test your changes** - Verify the implementation works as expected
5. **Report your status** - Use the status markers below

## Status Markers

At the end of your response, include ONE of these status markers:

- `STATUS: IMPLEMENTED` - Successfully implemented the item
- `STATUS: SKIPPED` - Item was skipped (explain why)
- `STATUS: EXTERNAL` - Requires external action (explain what's needed)
- `STATUS: ERROR` - Encountered an error that prevented implementation

## Context

## Current Work Item
