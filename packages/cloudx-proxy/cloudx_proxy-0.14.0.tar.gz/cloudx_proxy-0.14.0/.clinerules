# cloudX-proxy

For detailed context, please refer to the `.ai/context/` directory:
- [Project Overview](.ai/context/project-overview.md)
- [Architecture](.ai/context/architecture.md)
- [Development & Contributing](.ai/context/development.md)

## Core Rules

1. **Context First**: Always consult the files in `.ai/context/` before starting a task to understand the project structure, architecture, and development standards.
2. **Update Context**: If you make significant changes to the architecture, project structure, or development processes, update the corresponding files in `.ai/context/`.
3. **Roadmap**: Check `.ai/roadmap/` for planned improvements and known issues.

## Quick Reference

CloudX is a development environment consisting of:
- A local VSCode installation
- A remote development server (EC2 instance) running with auto-shutdown

The cloudX-proxy is a tool that allows you to access the remote development server from your local VSCode installation over an ssh connection established by the cloudX-proxy.

### Operating Modes

- **setup**: Establishes config files and directories.
- **connect**: Establishes the actual connection (used as ProxyCommand).

### Future Considerations

[Potential Breaking Change] Replacing all default values from 'vscode' to 'cloudx' would align the naming but would be a breaking change. This would affect default profile names, SSH key names, and configuration directories.
