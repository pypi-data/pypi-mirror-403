"""Package init for compiled list ops

This module provides the compiled (Cython/C++) function implementations as
convenience re-exports at the package level. The build process creates a
compiled extension named `function_definitions`, so we import all public
symbols from it into the package namespace for compatibility with code that
imports directly from `opteryx.compiled.list_ops`.
