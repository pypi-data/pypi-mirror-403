Filter utilities for traversing and selecting objects in nested structures.

This module provides a flexible filtering system for working with nested data
structures in BrainState. It offers various filter classes and utilities to
select, match, and transform objects based on their properties, types, or
positions within a hierarchical structure.

Key Features
------------
- **Type-based filtering**: Select objects by their type or inheritance
- **Tag-based filtering**: Filter objects that have specific tags
- **Path-based filtering**: Select based on object paths in nested structures
- **Logical operations**: Combine filters with AND, OR, and NOT operations
- **Flexible conversion**: Convert various inputs to predicate functions

Filter Types
------------
The module provides several built-in filter classes:

- :class:`WithTag`: Filters objects with specific tags
- :class:`PathContains`: Filters based on path contents
- :class:`OfType`: Filters by object type
- :class:`Any`: Logical OR combination of filters
- :class:`All`: Logical AND combination of filters
- :class:`Not`: Logical negation of a filter
- :class:`Everything`: Matches all objects
- :class:`Nothing`: Matches no objects

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import brainstate as bs
    >>> from brainstate.util.filter import WithTag, OfType, Any, All, Not
    >>>
    >>> # Filter objects with a specific tag
    >>> tag_filter = WithTag('trainable')
    >>>
    >>> # Filter objects of a specific type
    >>> type_filter = OfType(bs.nn.Linear)
    >>>
    >>> # Combine filters with logical operations
    >>> combined_filter = All(
    ...     WithTag('trainable'),
    ...     OfType(bs.nn.Linear)
    ... )
    >>>
    >>> # Negate a filter
    >>> not_trainable = Not(WithTag('trainable'))
    >>>
    >>> # Use Any for OR operations
    >>> any_filter = Any(
    ...     OfType(bs.nn.Linear),
    ...     OfType(bs.nn.Conv)
    ... )

Using Filters with Tree Operations
-----------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import brainstate as bs
    >>> import jax.tree_util as tree
    >>> from brainstate.util.filter import to_predicate, WithTag
    >>>
    >>> # Create a model with tagged parameters
    >>> class Model(bs.Module):
    ...     def __init__(self):
    ...         super().__init__()
    ...         self.layer1 = bs.nn.Linear(10, 20)
    ...         self.layer1.tag = 'trainable'
    ...         self.layer2 = bs.nn.Linear(20, 10)
    ...         self.layer2.tag = 'frozen'
    >>>
    >>> model = Model()
    >>>
    >>> # Filter trainable parameters
    >>> trainable_filter = to_predicate('trainable')
    >>>
    >>> # Apply filter in tree operations
    >>> def get_trainable_params(model):
    ...     return tree.tree_map_with_path(
    ...         lambda path, x: x if trainable_filter(path, x) else None,
    ...         model
    ...     )

Notes
-----
This module is adapted from the Flax library and provides similar functionality
for filtering and selecting components in neural network models and other
hierarchical data structures.

    --------
    .. code-block:: python
