    Calculate time-varying loudness using Zwicker method (ISO 532-1:2017).

    This operation computes the loudness of non-stationary signals according to
    the Zwicker method, as specified in ISO 532-1:2017. It uses the MoSQITo library's
    implementation of the standardized loudness calculation.

    The loudness is calculated in sones, a unit of perceived loudness where a doubling
    of sones corresponds to a doubling of perceived loudness.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sampling_rate : float
        Sampling rate in Hz. The signal should be sampled at a rate appropriate
        for the analysis (typically 44100 Hz or 48000 Hz for audio).
    field_type : str, default="free"
        Type of sound field. Options:
        - 'free': Free field (sound arriving from a specific direction)
        - 'diffuse': Diffuse field (sound arriving uniformly from all directions)

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        Operation name: "loudness_zwtv"
    field_type : str
        The sound field type used for calculation

    Examples
    --------
    Calculate loudness for a signal:
    >>> import wandas as wd
    >>> signal = wd.read_wav("audio.wav")
    >>> loudness = signal.loudness_zwtv(field_type="free")

    Notes
    -----
    - The output contains time-varying loudness values in sones
    - For mono signals, the loudness is calculated directly
    - For multi-channel signals, loudness is calculated per channel
    - The method follows ISO 532-1:2017 standard for time-varying loudness
    - Typical loudness values: 1 sone ≈ 40 phon (loudness level)

    This operation computes the roughness of audio signals according to
    the Daniel and Weber (1997) method. It uses the MoSQITo library's
    implementation of the standardized roughness calculation.

    Roughness is a psychoacoustic metric that quantifies the perceived
    harshness or roughness of a sound. The unit is asper, where higher
    values indicate rougher sounds.

    The calculation follows the standard formula:
    R = 0.25 * sum(R'_i) for i=1 to 47 Bark bands

    Parameters
    ----------
    sampling_rate : float
        Sampling rate in Hz. The signal should be sampled at a rate appropriate
        for the analysis (typically 44100 Hz or 48000 Hz for audio).
    overlap : float, default=0.5
        Overlapping coefficient for the analysis windows (0.0 to 1.0).
        The analysis uses 200ms windows:
        - overlap=0.5: 100ms hop size → ~10 Hz output sampling rate
        - overlap=0.0: 200ms hop size → ~5 Hz output sampling rate

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        Operation name: "roughness_dw"
    overlap : float

    Examples

    Calculate roughness for a signal:

    >>> roughness = signal.roughness_dw(overlap=0.5)
    >>> print(f"Mean roughness: {roughness.data.mean():.2f} asper")

    Notes
    -----
    - The output contains time-varying roughness values in asper
    - For mono signals, the roughness is calculated directly
    - For multi-channel signals, roughness is calculated per channel
    - The method follows Daniel & Weber (1997) standard

    Calculate time-varying sharpness using DIN 45692 method.

    This operation computes the sharpness of audio signals according to

    Sharpness quantifies the perceived sharpness of a sound, with units
    in acum (acum = 1 when the sound has the same sharpness as a
    2 kHz narrow-band noise with a level of 60 dB).

    Parameters
    ----------
    sampling_rate : float
        Sampling rate in Hz. The signal should be sampled at a rate appropriate
        for the analysis (typically 44100 Hz or 48000 Hz for audio).
    weighting : str, default="din"
        Weighting function used for the sharpness computation. Options:
        - 'din': DIN 45692 method
        - 'aures': Aures method
        - 'bismarck': Bismarck method
        - 'fastl': Fastl method
    field_type : str, default="free"
        Type of sound field. Options:
        - 'free': Free field (sound arriving from a specific direction)
        - 'diffuse': Diffuse field (sound arriving uniformly from all directions)

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        Operation name: "sharpness_din"
    weighting : str
        The weighting function used for sharpness calculation
    field_type : str
        The sound field type used for calculation

    Examples
    --------
    Calculate sharpness for a signal:
    >>> import wandas as wd
    >>> signal = wd.read_wav("sharp_sound.wav")
    >>> sharpness = signal.sharpness_din(weighting="din", field_type="free")
    >>> print(f"Mean sharpness: {sharpness.data.mean():.2f} acum")

    Notes
    -----
    - The output contains time-varying sharpness values in acum
    - For mono signals, the sharpness is calculated directly
    - For multi-channel signals, sharpness is calculated per channel
    - The method follows DIN 45692 standard
    - Typical sharpness values: 0-5 acum for most sounds

        Parameters
        ----------
        input_shape : tuple
            Input data shape (channels, samples)

        Returns
        -------

            Output data shape: (channels, 1) - one sharpness value per channel

        Process array to calculate steady-state sharpness.

        This method calculates the steady-state sharpness for each channel
        of the input signal using the DIN 45692 method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : NDArrayReal
            Input signal array with shape (channels, samples) or (samples,)
