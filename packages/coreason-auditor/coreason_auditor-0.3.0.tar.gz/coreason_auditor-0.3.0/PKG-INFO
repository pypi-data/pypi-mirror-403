**"If it isn't documented in a PDF, it didn't happen. Turn logs into Law."**

`coreason-auditor` is the automated reporting engine for the CoReason ecosystem. It bridges the gap between "Technical Logging" (JSON streams) and "Regulatory Submission" (Human-readable documents) by generating cryptographically signed Audit Packages.

## Features

Based on the [Product Requirements](docs/product_requirements.md):

*   **Traceability Engine:** Maps Requirements $\to$ Tests $\to$ Results (RTM). Fails generation if critical requirements are uncovered.
*   **AI-BOM Generator:** Creates Software Bill of Materials (CycloneDX Standard) for models, data lineage, and dependencies.
*   **Session Replayer:** Forensic tool that reconstructs user sessions, displaying hidden "Thought Chains" and "Tool Calls" alongside user input.
*   **21 CFR Part 11 Signer:** Applies digital signatures to exported reports for immutability and authenticity.
*   **Deviation Reporting:** Prioritizes failures and interventions (Exception-First Reporting).
*   **Service C Microservice:** Asynchronous REST API for high-volume audit generation (FastAPI + Uvicorn).

## Installation

```bash
pip install coreason-auditor
```
