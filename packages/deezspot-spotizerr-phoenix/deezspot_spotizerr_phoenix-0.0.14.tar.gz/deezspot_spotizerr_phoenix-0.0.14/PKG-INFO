## Installation

(Provide instructions on how to install the library, e.g., using pip)

```bash
pip install deezspot-spotizerr
```

## Usage

### Initialization

**For Deezer:**

```python
from deezspot import DeeLogin

# Using ARL cookie (recommended)
deezer_downloader = DeeLogin(arl="YOUR_DEEZER_ARL_COOKIE")

# Or using email and password (less secure, might be deprecated by Deezer)
# deezer_downloader = DeeLogin(email="your_email", password="your_password")
```

**For Spotify:**

```python
from deezspot.spotloader import SpoLogin # Corrected import path

# You need Spotify API credentials (client_id, client_secret)
# and a credentials.json file for librespot-spotizerr-phoenix.
spotify_downloader = SpoLogin(
    credentials_path="path/to/your/credentials.json",
    spotify_client_id="YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID",
    spotify_client_secret="YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET"
)
```

### Downloading Content

**Deezer Examples:**

```python
# Download a track from Deezer
track_link_dee = "https://www.deezer.com/track/TRACK_ID"
downloaded_track = deezer_downloader.download_trackdee(
    link_track=track_link_dee,
    output_dir="./music_downloads",
    quality_download="FLAC", # or "MP3_320"
    convert_to="mp3-320" # Optional: convert to mp3 at 320kbps
)
print(f"Downloaded Deezer track: {downloaded_track.song_path}")

# Download an album from Deezer
album_link_dee = "https://www.deezer.com/album/ALBUM_ID"
downloaded_album = deezer_downloader.download_albumdee(
    link_album=album_link_dee,
    output_dir="./music_downloads",
    make_zip=True
)
print(f"Downloaded Deezer album: {downloaded_album.album_name}")
if downloaded_album.zip_path:
    print(f"Album ZIP created at: {downloaded_album.zip_path}")


# Download a playlist from Deezer
playlist_link_dee = "https://www.deezer.com/playlist/PLAYLIST_ID"
downloaded_playlist = deezer_downloader.download_playlistdee(
    link_playlist=playlist_link_dee,
    output_dir="./music_downloads"
)
print(f"Downloaded Deezer playlist: {len(downloaded_playlist.tracks)} tracks")

# Download an episode from Deezer
episode_link_dee = "https://www.deezer.com/episode/EPISODE_ID"
downloaded_episode = deezer_downloader.download_episode(
    link_episode=episode_link_dee,
    output_dir="./podcast_downloads"
)
print(f"Downloaded Deezer episode: {downloaded_episode.episode_path}")
```

**Spotify Examples:**

```python
# Download a track from Spotify
track_link_spo = "https://open.spotify.com/track/TRACK_ID"
downloaded_track_spo = spotify_downloader.download_track(
    link_track=track_link_spo,
    output_dir="./music_downloads_spotify",
    quality_download="VERY_HIGH", # or "HIGH", "NORMAL"
    convert_to="flac" # Optional: convert to FLAC
)
print(f"Downloaded Spotify track: {downloaded_track_spo.song_path}")

# Download an album from Spotify
album_link_spo = "https://open.spotify.com/album/ALBUM_ID"
downloaded_album_spo = spotify_downloader.download_album(
    link_album=album_link_spo,
    output_dir="./music_downloads_spotify",
    make_zip=True
)
print(f"Downloaded Spotify album: {downloaded_album_spo.album_name}")

# Download a playlist from Spotify
playlist_link_spo = "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/PLAYLIST_ID"
downloaded_playlist_spo = spotify_downloader.download_playlist(
    link_playlist=playlist_link_spo,
    output_dir="./music_downloads_spotify"
)
print(f"Downloaded Spotify playlist: {len(downloaded_playlist_spo.tracks)} tracks")

# Download an episode from Spotify
episode_link_spo = "https://open.spotify.com/episode/EPISODE_ID"
downloaded_episode_spo = spotify_downloader.download_episode(
    link_episode=episode_link_spo,
    output_dir="./podcast_downloads_spotify"
)
print(f"Downloaded Spotify episode: {downloaded_episode_spo.episode_path}")
```

**Smart Downloader (Deezer only for now):**

The smart downloader automatically detects the content type (track, album, playlist) from the URL.

```python
smart_link_dee = "https://www.deezer.com/album/ALBUM_ID_OR_TRACK_ID_OR_PLAYLIST_ID"
smart_download_result = deezer_downloader.download_smart(
    link=smart_link_dee,
    output_dir="./smart_downloads"
)
print(f"Smart download type: {smart_download_result.type}")
if smart_download_result.type == "track":
    print(f"Downloaded track: {smart_download_result.track.song_path}")
elif smart_download_result.type == "album":
    print(f"Downloaded album: {smart_download_result.album.album_name}")
# ... and so on for playlist
```

### Customizing Output Paths

You can customize the directory structure and track filenames using `custom_dir_format` and `custom_track_format` parameters available in most download methods. These parameters accept strings with placeholders that will be replaced with metadata.

**Available placeholders:**

- `%artist%`
- `%albumartist%`
- `%album%`
- `%title%`
- `%tracknumber%` (can be padded with `pad_tracks=True/False`)
- `%discnumber%`
- `%year%`
- `%genre%`
- `%isrc%`
- `%upc%` (for albums)
- `%quality%` (e.g., "FLAC", "320")
- `%explicit%` (e.g. "Explicit" or empty string)
- `%showname%` (for episodes)
- `%episodetitle%` (for episodes)
- `%podcastgenre%` (for episodes)
- `%playlist%` (for playlist downloads: playlist name)
- `%playlistnum%` (for playlist downloads: 1-based index of the track within the playlist; respects `pad_tracks`)

**Example:**

```python
# For Deezer
deezer_downloader.download_trackdee(
    link_track="some_track_link",
    output_dir="./custom_music",
    custom_dir_format="%artist%/%album% (%year%)",
    custom_track_format="%tracknumber%. %title% [%quality%]",
    pad_tracks=True # Results in "01. Song Title [FLAC]"
)

# For Spotify
spotify_downloader.download_track(
    link_track="some_spotify_track_link",
    output_dir="./custom_music_spotify",
    custom_dir_format="%artist% - %album%",
    custom_track_format="%title% - %artist%",
    pad_tracks=False
)
```

### Progress Reporting

You can provide a callback function during initialization to receive progress updates.

```python
def my_progress_callback(progress_data):
    # progress_data is a dictionary with information about the download progress
    # Example keys: "type", "status", "song", "artist", "progress", "total_tracks", "current_track", "parent", etc.
    print(f"Progress: {progress_data}")

# For Deezer
# deezer_downloader = DeeLogin(arl="YOUR_ARL", progress_callback=my_progress_callback)

# For Spotify
# spotify_downloader = SpoLogin(
#     credentials_path="path/to/credentials.json",
#     spotify_client_id="YOUR_ID",
#     spotify_client_secret="YOUR_SECRET",
#     progress_callback=my_progress_callback
# )
```

## Configuration

### Deezer

- **ARL Cookie:** The primary method for Deezer authentication. You can obtain this from your browser's developer tools when logged into Deezer.
- **Email/Password:** Can be used but is less secure and may have limitations.

### Spotify

- **Spotify API Credentials:** You'll need a Client ID and Client Secret from the Spotify Developer Dashboard.
- **`credentials.json`:** This file is used by the underlying `librespot-spotizerr-phoenix` library for session management. The `SpoLogin` class requires the path to this file. If it doesn't exist, `librespot-spotizerr-phoenix` might attempt to create it or guide you through an authentication flow (behavior depends on `librespot-spotizerr-phoenix`).

## Logging

The library uses Python's standard `logging` module. You can configure the logging level and output:

```python
import logging
from deezspot import set_log_level, enable_file_logging, disable_logging

# Set logging level (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, WARNING)
set_log_level(logging.DEBUG)

# Enable logging to a file
# enable_file_logging("deezspot.log", level=logging.INFO)

# Disable all logging
# disable_logging()
```
