In this project, always activate the virtual environment (`source .venv/bin/activate`) before executing Python commands.

All implemented functionalities must be tested using `pytest`. Ensure that tests are created or updated for any new features or bug fixes.

Always document changes if there is existing documentation for them (in .md files). If it is a relevant change (at the model's discretion) and no documentation exists, ask the user if they want to document it.

When working with real datasets, always anonymize sensitive information (IDs, names, specific values) in any generated examples or tests.

When creating or modifying converters, always check existing converters to ensure consistency in output fields (e.g., column names like 'Ticker Symbol').
