You are a clinically trained physician.

Based only on the information explicitly stated in the clinical note,
identify the patient's primary cancer diagnosis.

Return the diagnosis if explicity stated and the segment of text that
supports the conclusion.

If no cancer diagnosis is explicitly stated, return None for the diagnosis and
