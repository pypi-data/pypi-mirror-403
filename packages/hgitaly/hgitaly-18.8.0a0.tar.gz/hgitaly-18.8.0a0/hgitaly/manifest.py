"""High level utilities for Mercurial manifest handling.

The purpose is both to provide exactly what the HGitaly services need
and to abstract away from the actual manifest implementation: we might
at some point switch to some version of Tree Manifest if one appears that
fills our basic needs (namely to be a peer implementation detail, having no
effect on changeset IDs).

The module is meant to harbour several classes, according to the
underlying Mercurial core implementations. The dispatching is done by
the :func:`miner` fatory function.

It is legitimate to optimize each class according to the (stable) properties
of the core manifest object it works on.

        Implementation for the standard Mercurial manifest has of course
        to be very different, since it lists full paths to leaf
        (non-directory) files. In particular, there are no empty directories.

        The interpretation  is that the "flat path" is the longest
        common directory ancestor of all file entries that are inside the
        considered directory entry. Here is a proof (can certainly be much
        simplified in a direct reasoning not involving reductio at absurdum,
        but writing it down was enough to convince ourselves).

        0. Assumptions and conventions:

           + there is no empty directory (guaranteed by the manifest data
             structure in the Mercurial case).
           + by X≤Y, we mean that Y is a path ancestor of X (inclusive)
           + let E be the considered directory entry and Fp its flat path
             as computed by the Golang implementation

        1. Fp is a common directory ancestor of all file entries f such that
           f≤E

           Let G be the greatest common ancestor of Fp and f.
           The crawling performed by the implementation went through G,
           since Fp≤G, so let's see what happened then.
           If f is a direct child of G, then Fp=G. If not, then let h be the
           direct child of G such that f≤h. h cannot be the only directory
           child of g: otherwise we would have Fp≤h, and h would be a greater
           common ancestor of Fp and f. Therefore the crawling stopped at G,
           hence Fp=G.

        2. Let G be the greatest common directory ancestor of all file entries
           f such that f≤E are ancestors of Fp.

           By derinition of "greatest", G≤Fp because Fp is a common directory
           ancestor.
           Let's see what the crawling implementation did at G if G≠Fp:

           Because of the halting condition of the implementation,
           either Fp has a file child and is therefore the greatest common
           directory ancestor, or Fp has at least two distinct directory
           children. Obviously, Only one of those can be an ancestor of G.
           So let h be a child of Fp such that G≤h is false. There is at least
           a file entry k such that k≤h, because directory entries cannot be
           empty. G is not an ancestor of k, contradicting its definition,
           so G must be equal to Fp.

        This implementation relies on manifest to emit paths in sorted manner.
