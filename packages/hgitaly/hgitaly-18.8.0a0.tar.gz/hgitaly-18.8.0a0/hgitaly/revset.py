    In many cases, `revision` arguments to Gitaly gRPC methods can be
    any valid Git revision specifications (revspecs), since they often are
    simply forwarded to an actual Git subprocess.

    At this point, we only support most common Git revision ranges, and
    the case of a single revision.

    No symbolic name like bookmarks, GitLab branches or tags are in the
    resulting revset: there are only operators and revnos or node ids.
    Hence it is appropriate (and often needed) to use it on unfiltered
    repositories.

    The resulting revset includes the sorting directive to make it consistent
    with the default `git log` ordering.

       the resulting revset with additional following of copy tracking. In

       to iterate quadratically on them (ancestors of each ancestor), which
       can exhaust all system resources on large repositories (hgitaly#117).
