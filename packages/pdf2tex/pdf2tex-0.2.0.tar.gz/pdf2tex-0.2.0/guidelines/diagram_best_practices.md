Software diagram best practices focus on clarity, audience relevance, and consistency, emphasizing simplicity, standardized notations (like UML or C4), clear labeling, and tailoring detail to the audience, while using legends and maintaining up-to-date, centrally stored diagrams to effectively communicate system structure and interactions. Key practices include defining purpose, choosing the right diagram type, showing different views (context, component, operational), and iterating with stakeholder feedback. 
Core Principles

    Know Your Audience: Tailor complexity to who's reading it (e.g., business vs. developers).
    Define Purpose: Clearly state what the diagram aims to explain (e.g., data flow, infrastructure).
    Simplicity & Clarity: Avoid clutter; focus on essential components and interactions.
    Consistency: Use standard symbols (UML, C4) and maintain a uniform look across diagrams.
    Keep it Updated: Diagrams must reflect the current system; store them centrally. 

Practical Steps

    Start High-Level: Begin with context diagrams (system & external users) before drilling down.
    Choose the Right View: Create conceptual (user value), component (interactions), and operational (infra) views.
    Use Standard Notations: Stick to conventions like C4 Model (Context, Containers, Components, Code) or UML.
    Label Clearly: Use unambiguous names and avoid unnecessary jargon.
    Add Detail (Sensibly): Use legends, color-coding, and logical groupings for better readability.
    Show Data/Flow: Visualize data movement and interactions, especially for event-driven systems.
    Complement with Text: Add descriptions for complex parts, but let diagrams tell the main story.
    Collaborate: Get feedback from stakeholders and iterate to ensure alignment. 

Common Pitfalls to Avoid

    Information Overload: Don't cram too much into one diagram.
    Stale Diagrams: Outdated diagrams are misleading.
    Language Barriers: Use simple, shared language.
    Fragmented Storage: Keep diagrams in a single, authoritative source.
