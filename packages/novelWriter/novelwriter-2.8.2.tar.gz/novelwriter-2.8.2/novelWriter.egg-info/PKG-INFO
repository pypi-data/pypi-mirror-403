novelWriter is a plain text editor designed for writing novels assembled from many smaller text
documents. It uses a minimal formatting syntax inspired by Markdown, and adds a meta data syntax
for comments, synopsis, and cross-referencing. It's designed to be a simple text editor that allows
for easy organisation of text and notes, using human readable text files as storage for robustness.

The project storage is suitable for version control software, and also well suited for file
synchronisation tools. All text is saved as plain text files with a meta data header, the core
project structure is stored in a single project XML file, and other meta data is primarily saved as
JSON files.

The application is written with Python 3 using Qt6 and PyQt6. It is developed on Linux, but should
in principle work fine on other operating systems as well as long as dependencies are met. It is
regularly tested on Debian and Ubuntu Linux, Windows, and MacOS.

novelWriter is developed and maintained by [Veronica Berglyd Olsen](https://github.com/vkbo).
