# 🛡️ PQC-Hero: Eradicate Your Quantum Debt

**PQC-Hero** is the world's first automated remediation engine for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Don't just find vulnerabilities—fix them in seconds.



## 🚀 Why PQC-Hero?
Today's encrypted data is being harvested by adversaries to be decrypted as soon as a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) exists. This is the **"Store Now, Decrypt Later"** threat.

## 🛠️ Features
* **Zero-Knowledge Scanning:** Your code never leaves your local machine.
* **Auto-Remediation:** One-click migration from RSA/ECC to NIST-approved $ML-KEM$ (Kyber).
* **Audit Reports:** Instantly calculate your "Quantum Debt" in USD.

## 📦 Quick Start
```bash
pip install pqc-hero
pqc-hero scan .
