## Claude Code Skill Installation

This CLI can be used as a [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill, allowing Claude to make phone calls on your behalf.

### Method 1: One-Line Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Install CLI globally
pip install kallyai-cli

# Create skills directory and download skill file
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/kallyai-api
curl -o ~/.claude/skills/kallyai-api/SKILL.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sltelitsyn/kallyai-cli/main/skill/SKILL.md
```

### Method 2: Install from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/sltelitsyn/kallyai-cli.git
cd kallyai-cli

# Install CLI
pip install -e .

# Copy skill to Claude Code
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/kallyai-api
cp skill/SKILL.md ~/.claude/skills/kallyai-api/
```

### Method 3: User Settings (Alternative)

Add to your Claude Code settings file (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "kallyai-api": {
      "path": "/path/to/kallyai-cli/skill"
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage in Claude Code

Once installed, Claude will automatically use the skill when you mention:
- "call", "phone call", "make a call"
- "reservation", "book a table"
- "appointment", "schedule"
- "KallyAI"

**Example prompts:**
- "Call +15551234567 and ask about their store hours"
- "Make a reservation at Italian Bistro for 4 people at 8pm"
- "Check my KallyAI usage"
- "Show my recent calls"

## Security

- **Token storage**: `~/.kallyai_token.json` with 0600 permissions
- **CSRF protection**: State parameter validation
- **Localhost only**: OAuth redirects only to localhost/127.0.0.1
- **Auto-refresh**: Tokens refresh automatically when expired
