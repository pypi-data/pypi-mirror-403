title: "Reply Wizard"
subtitle: "Reply Wizard is an end-to-end agentic workflow that transforms an incoming email into a high-quality, polished response. The process starts with Reply Context Wizard, which extracts intent, key points, tone, and urgency from the original message. Reply Draft Wizard then composes the initial draft based on this structured context. Reply Critique Wizard reviews the draft and provides actionable improvement points, which Reply Polish Wizard uses to refine and deliver a professional, engaging, and ready-to-send email."
