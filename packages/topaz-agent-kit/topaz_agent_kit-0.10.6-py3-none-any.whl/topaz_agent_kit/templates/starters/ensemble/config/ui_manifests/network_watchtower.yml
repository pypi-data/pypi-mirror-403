title: "Network Watchtower"
subtitle: "Network Watchtower is an end-to-end agentic workflow that automates network incident triage, root cause analysis, and resolution recommendations for network outages and performance issues. The process starts with a parser agent that extracts structured information from incident descriptions, followed by parallel execution of mock network data generation and severity classification. A root cause analyzer examines the generated network data to identify the likely cause of the incident. A resolution recommender then suggests actions with impact analysis. For high or critical severity incidents, a conditional selection gate allows users to decide whether to create a detailed change plan. If selected, a change planner generates a step-by-step change plan. Finally, a final response agent combines all recommendations and change plans (if applicable) into a complete incident response package."
