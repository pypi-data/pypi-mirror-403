title: "Argus"
subtitle: "Argus is an anomaly detection pipeline for financial journal entries that acts as an all-seeing watchman for financial irregularities. Like the mythological Argus who had a hundred eyes, this pipeline scans journal entries for anomalies before posting, detects Capital/Revenue and Lease/ROU misclassifications, suggests corrections, and routes entries to async human review or straight-through processing. Async human reviews can be viewed and acted upon in the Operations Center, ensuring only valid journal entries proceed while catching anomalies before they impact the financial records."
