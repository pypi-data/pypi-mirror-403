subtitle: "Focused agentic workflows with three specialized pipelines (Aegis, Argus, Covenant) plus independent agents. Aegis provides automated invoice processing and validation. Argus detects financial anomalies in journal entries. Covenant manages enterprise contract lifecycle intelligence. Includes independent agents for content analysis, RAG queries, content extraction, image extraction, and web search."
