     - Recommended resolution actions with priority
     - Change plan (if available) with steps and rollback procedures
     - Estimated resolution time
     - Clear separation between immediate actions and detailed change plans

2. Structure the final package:
   - **Incident Summary**: Location, symptoms, severity, impact
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: Primary root cause, details, confidence
   - **Resolution Recommendations**: Prioritized actions with impact, risk, and effort
   - **Change Plan** (if present): Step-by-step implementation plan with rollback procedures
   - **Timeline**: Estimated resolution time

3. Format for clarity:
   - Use clear headings and sections
   - Highlight priority actions
   - Include risk and effort information
