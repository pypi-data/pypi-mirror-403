title: "JD Architect"
subtitle: "JD Architect is an end-to-end agentic workflow that generates detailed job descriptions and competitive salary ranges based on job roles. The process starts with a parser agent that extracts structured information from user input, followed by a conditional selection gate for job level if not provided. A research agent then gathers current market data on salaries, skills, and qualifications. An analysis agent synthesizes this research into structured requirements and salary ranges. Finally, a generation agent creates a comprehensive job description in markdown format with embedded salary information."
