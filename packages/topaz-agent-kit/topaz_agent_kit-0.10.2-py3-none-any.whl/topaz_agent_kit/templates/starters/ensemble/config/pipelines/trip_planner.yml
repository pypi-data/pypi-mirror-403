pattern:
  type: sequential
  name: "Trip Planning and Coordination Flow"

    ## Trip Planning and Coordination Flow
    
    This sequential pattern orchestrates the complete trip planning workflow:
    1. **Requester** parses the trip request and determines which domains are needed
    2. **Clarification Loop** (conditional) collects additional details if needed
    3. **Parallel Domain Experts** run flights, hotels, and activities experts concurrently with conditional execution
    4. **Aggregator** combines all selections into a final trip summary
    
    The parallel pattern uses conditional execution to only run relevant domain experts based on the trip requirements, with each expert followed by an immediate selection gate for user approval.
  steps:
    # 1) Coordinator parses request and computes flags/slots
    - node: trip_requester
    # 2) Conversational clarification loop (single gate)
    - gate: collect_clarification
      condition: "trip_requester.clarification_needed == true"
      on_submit: retry_node
      retry_target: trip_requester
      max_retries: 5
      on_cancel: stop

    # 3) EAGER: Parallel execution where each domain (expert + gate) runs independently
    # Each gate appears as soon as its expert finishes (no waiting for all experts)
    - type: parallel
      name: "Parallel Domain Expert Execution"
      description: |
        ## Concurrent Domain Processing
        
        This parallel pattern runs domain experts concurrently with eager gate execution:
        - **Flights Expert** (conditional) finds flight options if flights are needed
        - **Hotels Expert** (conditional) finds hotel options if hotels are needed
        - **Activities Expert** (conditional) finds activity options if activities are needed
        
        Each expert is followed immediately by a selection gate that appears as soon as the expert finishes, allowing users to approve selections without waiting for all experts to complete. Only domains marked as ready in the trip request are executed.
      steps:
        # Flights domain: Expert → Gate (appears immediately when expert finishes)
        - type: sequential
          name: "Flights Domain Flow"
          description: |
            ## Flights Selection Process
            
            This conditional sequential pattern handles flight selection:
            1. **Flights Expert** searches for flight options matching the trip requirements
            2. **Selection Gate** appears immediately when expert finishes, allowing user to choose preferred flights
            
            Only executes if flights are required for the trip.
          condition: "trip_requester.flights_ready == true"
          steps:
            - node: trip_flights_expert
            - gate: select_flights
              condition: "trip_flights_expert.has_flights == true"
              on_submit: continue
              on_cancel: stop

        # Hotels domain: Expert → Gate (appears immediately when expert finishes)
        - type: sequential
          name: "Hotels Domain Flow"
          description: |
            ## Hotels Selection Process
            
            This conditional sequential pattern handles hotel selection:
            1. **Hotels Expert** searches for hotel options matching the trip requirements
            2. **Selection Gate** appears immediately when expert finishes, allowing user to choose preferred hotels
            
            Only executes if hotels are required for the trip.
          condition: "trip_requester.hotels_ready == true"
          steps:
            - node: trip_hotels_expert
            - gate: select_hotels
              condition: "trip_hotels_expert.has_hotels == true"
              on_submit: continue
              on_cancel: stop

        # Activities domain: Expert → Gate (appears immediately when expert finishes)
        - type: sequential
          name: "Activities Domain Flow"
          description: |
            ## Activities Selection Process
            
            This conditional sequential pattern handles activity selection:
            1. **Activities Expert** searches for activity options matching the trip requirements
            2. **Selection Gate** appears immediately when expert finishes, allowing user to choose preferred activities
            
            Only executes if activities are required for the trip.
          condition: "trip_requester.activities_ready == true"
          steps:
            - node: trip_activities_expert
            - gate: select_activities
              condition: "trip_activities_expert.has_activities == true"
              on_submit: continue
