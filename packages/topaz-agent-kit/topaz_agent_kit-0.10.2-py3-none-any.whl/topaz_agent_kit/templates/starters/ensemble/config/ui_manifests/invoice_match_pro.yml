title: "Invoice Match Pro"
subtitle: "Invoice Match Pro is an end-to-end agentic workflow that automates three-way matching of invoices against Purchase Orders (POs) and Statements of Work (SOWs). The process scans a folder for unprocessed PDF invoices, extracts invoice data, performs parallel lookups for matching PO and SOW records, executes a three-way match analysis, handles human-in-the-loop decisions for invoices needing clarification, moves files to appropriate folders (approved/declined/clarification), and generates a final processing summary report."
