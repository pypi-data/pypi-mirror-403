  - id: "rate_case_data_summarizer"
    title: "Data Summarizer"
    subtitle: "Validates database schema, summarizes customer usage data, demographics, existing rates, and voice-of-customer feedback. Creates pipeline run tracking entry and ensures data quality for downstream analysis."
    icon: "assets/rate_case_data_summarizer.svg"
  
  - id: "rate_case_rate_designer"
    title: "Rate Designer"
    subtitle: "Designs 5-10 comprehensive rate structure options (flat, tiered, time-of-use) and program options (demand response, EV programs, income-qualified programs) with detailed parameters, assumptions, and design rationale based on customer segments and elasticity data."

  - id: "rate_case_option_validator"
    title: "Option Validator"
    subtitle: "Validates rate design options by running quick simulations to estimate revenue and bill impacts. Options are validated if revenue change is within ±5 percentage points of the specified revenue growth target (e.g., if target is 8%, revenue should be between 3% and 13%) and average bill change is within ±10% to ensure realistic and acceptable rate proposals."
    icon: "assets/rate_case_option_validator.svg"
  
  - id: "rate_case_scenario_simulator"
    title: "Scenario Simulator"
    subtitle: "Runs deterministic financial and load simulations for each rate option, calculating total revenue, average bill changes, peak load impacts, and customer winners/losers using actual customer usage data to quantify real-world impacts."
    icon: "assets/rate_case_scenario_simulator.svg"
  
  - id: "rate_case_equity_assessor"
    title: "Equity Assessor"
    subtitle: "Evaluates fairness and equity impacts by analyzing bill changes across demographic groups (income, seniors, housing burden), identifies customers at hardship risk, and calculates an equity score (0-100) to ensure rate options protect vulnerable populations."

  - id: "rate_case_state_comparator"
    title: "State Comparator"
    subtitle: "Benchmarks each rate option against existing rates in the target state and competitive benchmark states, calculating a competitiveness score (0-100) and providing market positioning context to ensure proposals are competitive and defensible."

  - id: "rate_case_recommender"
    title: "Recommender"
    subtitle: "Synthesizes all analysis results to perform weighted multi-objective scoring across revenue, equity, load management, competitiveness, and customer satisfaction. Ranks all options, identifies key tradeoffs, and recommends the best-balanced option with confidence scoring."
    icon: "assets/rate_case_recommender.svg"
  
  - id: "rate_case_narrative_generator"
    title: "Narrative Generator"
    subtitle: "Creates comprehensive regulatory narrative that explains the selected rate structure in regulator-friendly language, incorporates customer feedback themes, provides detailed impact analysis and equity justifications, and anticipates common regulatory questions with prepared responses."

  - id: "rate_case_filing_artifacts_generator"
    title: "Filing Artifacts Generator"
    subtitle: "Generates the final consolidated filing-ready document with executive summary, detailed rate structure tables, impact exhibits, equity analysis, state comparisons, and comprehensive appendix. Creates browser-viewable markdown report and completes pipeline run tracking."
