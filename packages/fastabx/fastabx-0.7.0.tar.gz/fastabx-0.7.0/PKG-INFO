# Fast ABX evaluation

**fastabx** is a Python package for efficient computation of ABX discriminability.

The ABX discriminability measures how well categories of interest are separated in the representation space by
determining whether tokens from the same category are closer to each other than to those from a different category.
While ABX has been mostly used to evaluate speech representations, it is a generic framework that can be applied
to other domains of representation learning.

This package provides a simple interface that can be adapted to any ABX conditions, and to any input modality.

## Install

Install the pre-built package in your environment:

```bash
pip install fastabx
```

It requires Python 3.12 or later, and depends on PyTorch 2.10.0 or later, NumPy, Polars, tqdm, and [torchdtw](https://github.com/bootphon/torchdtw).
