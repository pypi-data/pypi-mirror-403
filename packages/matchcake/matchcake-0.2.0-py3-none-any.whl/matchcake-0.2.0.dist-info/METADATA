              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Description

MatchCake is a Python package that provides a new PennyLane device for simulating a specific class of quantum 
circuits called Matchgate circuits or matchcircuits. These circuits are made with matchgates, a class of restricted 
quantum unitaries that are parity-preserving and operate on nearest-neighbor qubits. These constraints lead to 
matchgates being classically simulable in polynomial time.

Additionally, this package provides quantum kernels made with [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) API allowing the 
use matchcircuits as kernels in quantum machine learning algorithms. One way to use these kernels could be in a Support Vector 
Machine (SVM).

Note that this package is built on PennyLane and PyTorch. This means that only the NumPy and PyTorch backends are compatible.
Other backends provided by Autoray, such as JAX and TensorFlow, are not supported.
We highly recommend using PyTorch as the backend when working with MatchCake.

import pennylane as qml
import numpy as np
from pennylane.ops.qubit.observables import BasisStateProjector

# Create a Non-Interacting Fermionic Device
nif_device = mc.NonInteractingFermionicDevice(wires=4)
initial_state = np.zeros(len(nif_device.wires), dtype=int)

# Define a quantum circuit
def circuit(params, wires, initial_state=None):
    qml.BasisState(initial_state, wires=wires)
    for i, even_wire in enumerate(wires[:-1:2]):
        idx = list(wires).index(even_wire)
        curr_wires = [wires[idx], wires[idx + 1]]
        mc.operations.CompRxRx(params, wires=curr_wires)
        mc.operations.CompRyRy(params, wires=curr_wires)
        mc.operations.CompRzRz(params, wires=curr_wires)
    for i, odd_wire in enumerate(wires[1:-1:2]):
        idx = list(wires).index(odd_wire)
        mc.operations.fSWAP(wires=[wires[idx], wires[idx + 1]])
    projector: BasisStateProjector = qml.Projector(initial_state, wires=wires)
    return qml.expval(projector)

# Create a QNode
nif_qnode = qml.QNode(circuit, nif_device)
qml.draw_mpl(nif_qnode)(np.array([0.1, 0.2]), wires=nif_device.wires, initial_state=initial_state)

# Evaluate the QNode
expval = nif_qnode(np.random.random(2), wires=nif_device.wires, initial_state=initial_state)
print(f"Expectation value: {expval}")
```

## Data Classification with MatchCake

```python
from matchcake.ml.kernels import FermionicPQCKernel
from matchcake.ml.visualisation import ClassificationVisualizer
from sklearn import datasets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Load the iris dataset
X, y = datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Create and fit the model
pipline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))),
    ('kernel', FermionicPQCKernel(n_qubits=4, rotations="X,Z").freeze()),
    ('classifier', SVC(kernel='precomputed')),
])
pipline.fit(x_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
test_accuracy = pipline.score(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

# Visualize the classification
viz = ClassificationVisualizer(x=X, n_pts=1_000)
viz.plot_2d_decision_boundaries(model=pipline, y=y, show=True)

## Fermionic Machine Learning Paper

[Fermionic Machine Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10821385) is a work presented at the 2024 IEEE 
International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE). The paper compares unconstrained quantum kernel 
methods with constraint-based kernels derived from matchgate (free-fermionic) circuits, and benchmarks their 
performance on supervised classification tasks. All free-fermionic kernels considered in this work were simulated 
using MatchCake.
