# pyproject-patcher

This Python package is an attempt to make it a little easier to
patch `pyproject.toml` in place.

It is mainly useful for maintainers of system packages.  
If you’re not a maintainer of system packages, or if you don’t know
what that means, then `pyproject-patcher` is probably not for you.

## Features

- Hard code a version number into `project.version`

- Disable all invocations of the dynamic version generator
  `setuptools-git-versioning`

- Remove dependency to `setuptools-git-versioning` from
  `build-system.requires`

- Configure `setuptools-git-versioning` to use a version template
  without a `.dirty` suffix

## Installation
