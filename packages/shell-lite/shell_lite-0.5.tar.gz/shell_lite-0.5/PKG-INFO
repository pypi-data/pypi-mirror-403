# ShellLite: The English-Like Programming Language
# By Shrey Naithani
ShellLite is a modern, interpreted programming language designed to prioritize human readability. It replaces complex syntax with natural English commands, making software development accessible and maintainable.

## Version 0.04.0 (Polaris Update)

This release transforms ShellLite from a scripting tool into a comprehensive platform with three major pillars:
1. **The Bridge**: Import and use any Python library (pandas, requests, etc.) natively.
2. **The Canvas**: Build native desktop GUI applications with declarative syntax.
3. **The Universe**: Integrated package management for project dependencies.

## Installation

### Via PyPI (Recommended)
You can install ShellLite directly from PyPI:
```bash
pip install shell-lite
```

### Windows Installer
Download the latest `shl.exe` from the Releases page.

## Compilation

To compile ShellLite code to native machine code (LLVM IR):

```bash
shl compile script.shl
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Hello World
Save this as `hello.shl`:
```shell-lite
say "Hello, World"
```
Run it:
```bash
shl hello.shl
```
## Project Management

Initialize a new project:
```bash
shl init
```

Install dependencies defined in `shell-lite.toml`:
```bash
shl install
```
