# Docker cagent

**Agent Builder and Runtime by Docker Engineering**

Docker cagent lets you build, orchestrate, and share AI agents that work together as a team.

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Agent System**: Intelligent task delegation between multiple agents
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Rich tool ecosystem via MCP integration
- **Multiple Interfaces**: CLI, TUI, API server, and MCP server modes
- **Share & Distribute**: Package and share agents to Docker Hub as OCI artifacts

## Agent Client Protocol Support

cagent supports ACP, enabling integration with ACP-compatible editors and development environments.

## Installation

The easiest way to get cagent is to install Docker Desktop version 4.49 or later, which includes cagent.

## Distribution

Agent configurations can be packaged and shared using the `cagent push` command, treating agents as reproducible OCI artifacts.
