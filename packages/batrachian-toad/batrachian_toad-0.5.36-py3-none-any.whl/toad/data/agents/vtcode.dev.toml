  - Tree-sitter integration for syntax-aware analysis
  - ast-grep integration for semantic search
  - Advanced token budget tracking
- **Multi-LLM Support**: Works with multiple LLM providers with automatic failover
- **Rich Terminal UI**: Real-time streaming in a beautiful TUI
- **Editor Integration**: Native support for Zed IDE via ACP
- **Security**: Defense-in-depth security model

## Smart Tools

- Built-in code analysis and refactoring
- File operations with semantic understanding
- Terminal command execution
- Lifecycle hooks for custom shell commands

## Agent Client Protocol (ACP)

VT Code integrates natively with Zed IDE and other ACP-compatible editors. The ACP standardizes communication between code editors and coding agents.

## Context Management

Efficient context curation with:
- Semantic search capabilities
- Token budget tracking
- Smart context window management
