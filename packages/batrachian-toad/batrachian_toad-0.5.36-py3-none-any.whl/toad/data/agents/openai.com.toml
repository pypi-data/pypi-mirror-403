# Codex CLI

**Lightweight coding agent that runs in your terminal**

Codex CLI is OpenAI's terminal-based coding agent with built-in support for the Agent Client Protocol.

## Features

- **Agent Client Protocol (ACP)**: Native ACP support for seamless editor integration
- **Zed Integration**: Built-in support in Zed IDE (v0.208+)
- **Terminal-First**: Designed for developers who live in the command line

## ACP Integration

Codex works out-of-the-box with ACP-compatible editors:
- Zed: Open agent panel (cmd-?/ctrl-?) and start a new Codex thread
- Other ACP clients: Use the `codex-acp` command

## Installation

Install globally via npm or Homebrew:
- npm: `npm i -g @openai/codex`
- Homebrew: `brew install --cask codex`

For ACP adapter (used by editors): Install from https://github.com/zed-industries/codex-acp/releases
