clean_architecture:
  - Dependencies point inward only
  - Inner layers never import from outer layers
  - Domain logic has no external dependencies

solid:
  - "Single Responsibility: Each module has one reason to change"
  - "Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification"
  - "Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions"

general:
  - "Maximum function length: 30 lines"
  - "Maximum file length: 300 lines"
  - Prefer composition over inheritance
