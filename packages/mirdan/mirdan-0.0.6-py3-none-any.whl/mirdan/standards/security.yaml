authentication:
  - Never store passwords in plain text - use bcrypt with cost 12+
  - Use constant-time comparison for secret verification
  - Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
  - "Use HTTP-only, secure cookies for session tokens"

input_validation:
  - Validate all user inputs at API boundaries
  - Use allowlists over denylists for input validation
  - Sanitize data before database operations

data_handling:
  - "Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)"
  - Use parameterized queries exclusively - never string concatenation
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
