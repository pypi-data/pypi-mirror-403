# Planning Quality Standards
# Standards for creating implementation plans executable by less capable models

principles:
  - Every file reference must be verified with Read or Glob
  - Every line number must be exact after reading the file
  - Every API reference must be verified with context7
  - Each step must be atomic - one tool action only
  - All implicit requirements must be explicit (imports, exports, tests, types)

research_requirements:
  - Glob project structure before referencing directories
  - Read all files that will be modified
  - Read dependency manifest (pyproject.toml, package.json)
  - Query context7 for all external library APIs
  - Query enyal for project conventions and patterns

step_format:
  required_fields:
    - "File: exact path verified via Read"
    - "Action: specific tool name"
    - "Details: line numbers and exact changes"
    - "Depends On: prerequisite step numbers"
    - "Verify: how to confirm success"
    - "Grounding: which tool verified the facts"

anti_slop:
  forbidden_words:
    - should
    - probably
    - likely
    - maybe
    - around
    - somewhere
    - assume
    - might
    - possibly
  forbidden_patterns:
    - "around line"
    - "I think"
    - "I believe"
    - "standard practice"
  compound_step_indicators:
    - "and then"
    - "then also"
    - "first...then"
