principles:
  - Use Depends() with Annotated for type-safe dependency injection
  - Define Pydantic models for all request bodies and response schemas
  - Use async def for route handlers to enable concurrent request handling
  - Apply HTTPException with appropriate status codes for error responses
  - Use Security() dependencies for authentication and authorization
  - Use lifespan context manager for startup/shutdown lifecycle events
  - Organize routes with APIRouter for modular, maintainable code structure

forbidden:
  - Synchronous blocking I/O in async route handlers
  - Raw dicts instead of Pydantic models for request/response bodies
  - Global mutable state instead of proper dependency injection
  - Missing type hints on path and query parameters
  - Using deprecated @app.on_event decorators instead of lifespan

patterns:
  dependency_injection: "Annotated[Type, Depends(callable)] for clean, testable DI"
  validation: "Pydantic Field() with constraints for detailed input validation"
  router_organization: "APIRouter(prefix='/api/v1', tags=['feature']) for modular routes"
