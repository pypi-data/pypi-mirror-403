              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# 🧠 KonfAI
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vboussot/KonfAI/main/logo.png" alt="KonfAI Logo" width="250" align="right"/>

**KonfAI** is a flexible and extensible deep learning framework built on PyTorch, designed for **fully YAML-driven configuration**.  
It provides a clean separation between configuration and implementation, allowing users to orchestrate entire workflows, from data loading to evaluation, with no hardcoded logic.

KonfAI natively supports **multi-model training**, **patch-based learning**, **test-time augmentation**, and **loss scheduling**, making it ideal for medical imaging research and large-scale experimentation.

**KonfAI** has been used in several top-performing challenge projects:  
[🔗 SynthRAD2025 – Task 1](https://github.com/vboussot/Synthrad2025_Task_1) •  
[🔗 SynthRAD2025 – Task 2](https://github.com/vboussot/Synthrad2025_Task_2) •  
[🔗 CURVAS PDACVI 2025](https://github.com/vboussot/CurvasPDACVI) •  
[🔗 TrackRAD 2025](https://github.com/vboussot/TrackRAD2025) •  
[🔗 Panther](https://github.com/vboussot/Panther) •  
[🔗 CURVAS](https://github.com/vboussot/CURVAS) •

---

## 🚀 Installation

### From PyPI

Install KonfAI from PyPI:

```
pip install konfai
```

This will install the command-line tools:

```
konfai --help
konfai-cluster --help
```

---

### From GitHub

Clone the repository and install:

```
git clone https://github.com/vboussot/KonfAI.git
cd KonfAI
pip install -e .
```

---

## 🧪 Usage

```bash
konfai TRAIN --gpu 0
konfai PREDICTION --models checkpoint.pt --gpu 0
konfai EVALUATION
```

---

## 📦 KonfAI Apps

A **KonfAI App** is a self-contained workflow package built with KonfAI.  
It defines how a model is executed, how outputs are generated, and how optional evaluation or uncertainty workflows are performed.

Several ready-to-use KonfAI Apps are available directly in the repository under the [`apps/`](https://github.com/vboussot/KonfAI/tree/main/apps) directory.

They can be executed **identically** from:

| Interface | Command |
|----------|---------|
| 🖥️ CLI | `konfai-apps infer / eval / uncertainty / pipeline  app name` |
| 🧠 3D Slicer | Via **SlicerKonfAI** GUI https://github.com/vboussot/SlicerKonfAI |
| 🐍 Python API | Via `konfai.app.KonfAIApp` |
| 🌐 Remote Server (client/server mode) |

---

### 📂 Structure of a KonfAI App

```
my_konfai_app/
├── app.json                # Metadata for UI + behaviors
├── Prediction.yml          # Inference workflow (required)
├── Evaluation.yml          # Evaluation workflow (optional)
├── Uncertainty.yml         # Uncertainty workflow (optional)
└── checkpoint.pt           # Trained model (single or ensemble)
```

Example `app.json`:

```json
{
    "display_name": "Lung Lobe Segmentation",
    "short_description": "Segmentation of lung lobes on CBCT scans.",
    "description": "This App synthesizes CT-like contrast from CBCT then segments lung lobes.",
    "tta": 4,
    "mc": 0
}
```

---

### 🚀 Using a KonfAI App (CLI)

Inference:
```bash
konfai-apps infer my_app -i input.mha -o ./Predictions --tta 4
```

Evaluation:
```bash
konfai-apps eval my_app -i input/ --gt labels/
```

Uncertainty:
```bash
konfai-apps uncertainty my_app -i input.mha
```

Pipeline (inference → evaluation → uncertainty):
```bash
konfai-apps pipeline my_app -i input.mha --gt gt.mha -uncertainty
```

Fine-tuning:
```bash
konfai-apps fine-tune my_app name -d ./Dataset --epochs 20
```

The very same commands can be executed on a remote KonfAI Apps server by adding
--host, --port, and --token. This allows heavy workloads to run on shared GPU
machines while keeping a lightweight local client.

More detailed documentation and usage examples for each app are available in the corresponding subdirectories of the `apps/` folder.

## 🧩 TODO & Perspectives

### 📘 Documentation

The official KonfAI documentation is in progress and will be released soon.

### 🤖 KonfAI-MCP Server

We are actively developing KonfAI-MCP, an extension of the framework enabling language-driven deep learning experimentation.
Through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), KonfAI will serve as the deterministic and transparent execution layer for agentic LLMs, allowing large language models to specify, launch, and refine deep learning experiments directly through natural language.

Imagine instructing an AI to:
“Train a model for lung tumor segmentation from this dataset and optimize the Dice score.”
KonfAI-MCP aims to turn such instructions into reproducible, verifiable experiments.

This represents the next stage of AI-assisted scientific research, where language becomes a medium of empirical discovery.
