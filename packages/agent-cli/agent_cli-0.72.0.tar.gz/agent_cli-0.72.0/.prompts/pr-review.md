- **Code reuse**: Are there parts that should be reused from other places?
- **Organization**: Is everything in the right place?
- **Consistency**: Is it in the same style as other parts of the codebase?
- **Simplicity**: Is it not over-engineered? Remember KISS and YAGNI. No dead code paths and NO defensive programming.
