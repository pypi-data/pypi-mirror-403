# Agent CLI

A collection of **local-first**, AI-powered command-line agents that run entirely on your machine.

## What is Agent CLI?

Agent CLI provides a suite of powerful tools for voice and text interaction, designed for privacy, offline capability, and seamless integration with system-wide hotkeys and workflows.

> [!TIP]
> **Short aliases available:** You can use `agent` or `ag` instead of `agent-cli` for convenience.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Local and Private by Design**
>
> All agents can run **100% locally**. Your data—whether from your clipboard, microphone, or files—stays on your machine unless you configure a cloud provider. This keeps workflows private and allows the tools to work offline.
>
> You can optionally configure the agents to use OpenAI/Gemini services.

## Why I built this

I got tired of typing long prompts to LLMs. Speaking is faster, so I built this tool to transcribe my voice directly to the clipboard with a hotkey.

**What it does:**

- Voice transcription to clipboard with system-wide hotkeys (Cmd+Shift+R on macOS)
- Autocorrect any text from your clipboard
- Edit clipboard content with voice commands ("make this more formal")
- Runs locally - no internet required, your audio stays on your machine
- Works with any app that can copy/paste

I use it mostly for the `transcribe` command when working with LLMs. Being able to speak naturally means I can provide more context without the typing fatigue.

Since then I have expanded the tool with many more features, all focused on local-first AI agents that integrate seamlessly with your system.

## Quick Start

### Just want the CLI tool?

If you already have AI services running (or plan to use OpenAI):

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv tool install agent-cli -p 3.13

# Using pip
pip install agent-cli
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `-p 3.13` flag is required because some dependencies don't support Python 3.14 yet.
> See [uv issue #8206](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8206) for details.

Then use it:

```bash
agent-cli autocorrect "this has an eror"
```

### Want automatic setup with everything?

```bash
# 1. Install agent-cli
uv tool install agent-cli -p 3.13

# 2. Install all required services
agent-cli install-services

# 3. Start all services
agent-cli start-services

# 4. (Optional) Set up system-wide hotkeys
agent-cli install-hotkeys

# 5. Use it!
agent-cli autocorrect "this has an eror"
```

The setup automatically installs:

- ✅ Package managers (Homebrew/uv) if needed
- ✅ All AI services (Ollama, Whisper, TTS, etc.)
- ✅ The `agent-cli` tool
- ✅ System dependencies
- ✅ Hotkey managers (if using hotkey scripts)

## Requirements

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or Python 3.11+
- A microphone (for voice features)
- Speakers (for text-to-speech features)
