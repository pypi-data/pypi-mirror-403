# ERLANG BLENDING FUNCTIONS
# In the blending model, agents will work on inbound as well as outbound calls. 
# If an agent becomes available, they will prioritize inbound calls and will 
# only take on outbound calls when other agents are left idle.

class SLA():
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    Forecast : float
        The average number of arrivals per unit of time. (Forecast ≥ 0)
    AHT : float
        The Average Handling Time of a call. (AHT > 0)
    Agents : float
        Represents the number of agents; it can be real. (Agents ≥ 0)
    Awt : float
        The Acceptable Waiting Time is the maximum allowed waiting time.
        Customers that wait shorter than the Awt have received, per definition,
        a good service. The service level is defined as the percentage of 
        customers that are served within the Awt. The time unit is the same as 
        the others and, hence, is not necessarily in seconds! (Awt ≥ 0) 
    patience : float
        The average time a customer is willing to wait in the queue. 
    Threshold : float
        The number of agents that are kept idle before taking outbound calls into 
        service. (Threshold ≤ Agents)
        
    Returns
    -------
    float
        The expected service level.
