class SLA():
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    Forecast : float
        The average number of arrivals per unit of time. (Forecast ≥ 0)
    AHT : list
        The Average Handling Time of a call. (AHT > 0). The difference between 
        this and the previous AHT parameter is that the AHT should be a range 
        of cells instead of a single number. The number of elements in the range
        determines the maximum number of concurrent chats that an agent can do. 
        This parameter is exclusively used in the Chat functions.
    Agents : float
        Represents the number of agents; it can be real. (Agents ≥ 0)
    Awt : float
        The Acceptable Waiting Time is the maximum allowed waiting time.
        Customers that wait shorter than the Awt have received, per definition,
        a good service. The service level is defined as the percentage of 
        customers that are served within the Awt. The time unit is the same as 
        the others and, hence, is not necessarily in seconds! (Awt ≥ 0)
    Patience : float
        The average time a customer is willing to wait in the queue. A simple 
        estimator for the patience is calculated by dividing the total waiting 
        time (including the waiting times of the abandoned customers) by the 
        number of abandonments. It is important to filter out extreme values 
        in advance. (Patience ≥ 0)
       
    Returns
    -------
    float
        The expected service level.
