    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    Forecast : float
        The average number of arrivals per unit of time. (Forecast ≥ 0)
    AHT : float
        The Average Handling Time of a call. (AHT > 0)
    Agents : float
        Represents the number of agents; it can be real. (Agents ≥ 0)
    Awt : float
        The Acceptable Waiting Time is the maximum allowed waiting time.
        Customers that wait shorter than the Awt have received, per definition,
        a good service. The service level is defined as the percentage of 
        customers that are served within the Awt. The time unit is the same as 
        the others and, hence, is not necessarily in seconds! (Awt ≥ 0)
    Patience : float
        The average time a customer is willing to wait in the queue. A simple 
        estimator for the patience is calculated by dividing the total waiting 
        time (including the waiting times of the abandoned customers) by the 
        number of abandonments. It is important to filter out extreme values 
        in advance. (Patience ≥ 0)
    Retrials : float
        The probability that a customer who abandons, redials. (0 ≤ Retrials ≤ 1)
    Definition : int
        A flag to switch between different modes of calculating the service level. 
        0 = virtual service level; 1 = answered; 2 = offered (default).
    Variance : float
        The variance of the forecast. All models take fluctuations in the number of 
        arrivals into account. This is characterized by the Poisson distribution, 
        for which the variance is equal to the expectation. The Variance parameter 
        can be used in case the variance is bigger than the expectation. 
        (Variance ≥ Forecast)
    
    Returns
    -------
    float
        The expected service level.

            The Average Handling Time of a call. (AHT > 0). The difference between

        number of abandonments. It is important to filter out extreme values 
        in advance. (Patience ≥ 0)
    Retrials : float
        The probability that a customer who abandons, redials. (0 ≤ Retrials ≤ 1)
    Variance : float
        The variance of the forecast. All models take fluctuations in the number of 
        arrivals into account. This is characterized by the Poisson distribution, 
        for which the variance is equal to the expectation. The Variance parameter 
        can be used in case the variance is bigger than the expectation. 
        (Variance ≥ Forecast)
    
    Returns
    -------
    float
        The fraction of customers that abandon.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Forecast : float

    AHT : float
        The Average Handling Time of a call. (AHT > 0)
    Agents : float

    Patience : float
        The average time a customer is willing to wait in the queue. A simple 
        estimator for the patience is calculated by dividing the total waiting

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The average number of customers that retrial per unit of time.
