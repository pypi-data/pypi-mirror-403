    "# Multi-Stage Lead Screening Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a **complex, multi-stage screening workflow** that combines multiple everyrow operations with pandas data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** Qualify investment fund leads for a B2B research tools company. The workflow:\n",
    "1. Score funds by \"contrarian\" research approach (likely to adopt new tools)\n",
    "2. Filter to high-scoring candidates using pandas\n",
    "3. Research team sizes for remaining candidates\n",
    "4. Apply nuanced inclusion logic: include funds with strong research signals OR very small teams\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this approach?** Traditional tools force binary choices. This workflow captures the nuanced mental model: \"I want funds that show research-tool-adoption signals, but I'll also include tiny funds where even weak signals matter.\""
