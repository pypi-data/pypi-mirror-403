    "# Lead Scoring: Data Fragmentation Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates using everyrow's `rank()` utility to score B2B leads by their likelihood of suffering from data fragmentation challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** A data integration SaaS company wants to prioritize leads. Companies operating across multiple locations, entities, or point solutions are more likely to need data integration tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why everyrow?** Traditional enrichment tools provide data fields but can't interpret them. Manual review of 1,000 leads is prohibitively slow. everyrow's `rank()` analyzes each company's operational complexity semantically."
