    "# Lead Scoring Without CRM\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates using everyrow's `rank()` utility to score investment firms by their likelihood to purchase research tools—without needing CRM data or prior interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:** A research tools company wants to rank investment firms by product fit. Traditional approaches either require expensive CRM integrations or burn credits on enrichment tools that provide data without interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why everyrow?** The `rank()` function can analyze public information (website descriptions, investment focus, team characteristics) and provide both a score AND reasoning for why a firm was scored a certain way."
