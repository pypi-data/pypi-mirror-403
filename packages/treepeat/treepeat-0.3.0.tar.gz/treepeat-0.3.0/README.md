# Overview

`treepeat` is a tool that analyzes finds similarities in your codebase.

- Find **duplicate** code blocks meaningful to the language (classes/functions), not just lines (`--ruleset none`)
- Find **near-duplicates**, ignore whitespace, strings, high level AST nodes such as function and names (`--ruleset default`)
- Find **structurally similar** code, ignoring anonymizing identifiers, constants, etc (`--ruleset loose`)

Pull requests welcome: This is very much an proof of concept - I'm happy with it, but I haven't supported very many languages at present. PRs welcome!

Current languages supported so far: bash, css, go, html, javascript, markdown, python, sql, typescript, java, kotlin

## Usage

### Installation

```sh
pip insteall treepeat
```

### detect

Scan a codebase for similar or duplicate code blocks using tree-sitter AST analysis and locality-sensitive hashing.

Key flags:
- `--ruleset`: Normalization ruleset to use (`none`, `default`, `loose`) - controls how code is normalized before comparison
- `--similarity`: Percent similarity from 1-100 (default: 100 for exact duplicates)
- `--min-lines`: Minimum number of lines for a match (default: 5)
- `--diff`: Show side-by-side comparisons of similar blocks
- `--format`: Output format - `console` (default) or `sarif` for CI integration

```bash
# Find exact duplicates
treepeat detect /path/to/codebase

# Find near-duplicates with 80% similarity threshold
treepeat detect --similarity 80 /path/to/codebase

# Show diffs between similar blocks and use loose ruleset
treepeat --ruleset loose detect --diff --min-lines 10 /path/to/codebase

# Output results in SARIF format for CI tools
treepeat detect --format sarif -o results.sarif /path/to/codebase
```

### Other sub commands

#### list-ruleset

List all rules in a ruleset, along with their descriptions. Use `--language` to see which rules apply to a specific language.

#### treesitter

Display how treepeat normalizes source code into tree-sitter tokens for similarity detection -- helpful for debugging why a certain section of a file might be similar to another. Shows the original source code side-by-side with the normalized token representation.
