APE Escalation Handler

Agent Policy Engine
Version v1.0.1
https://github.com/kahalewai/agent-policy-engine

Per architecture spec (§7.8 Escalation Handler):
- Is an integration hook only
- Does not implement UI or approval logic
- Must be provided by the host application
- Default behavior: deny escalation

Note: In APE v1.0.1, escalation is not fully implemented.
This module provides the interface and a default deny handler.
Future versions will include:
- EscalationResolver interface
- Multiple resolver implementations
- Async escalation support
