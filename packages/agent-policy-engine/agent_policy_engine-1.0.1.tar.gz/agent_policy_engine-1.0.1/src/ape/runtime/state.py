APE Runtime State Machine

Agent Policy Engine
Version v1.0.1
https://github.com/kahalewai/agent-policy-engine

Per architecture spec (§8 Runtime State Machine):
- Valid states: INITIALIZED, INTENT_SET, PLAN_APPROVED, EXECUTING, ESCALATION_REQUIRED, TERMINATED
- Illegal transitions are rejected as security violations
- Execution requires EXECUTING state
- Escalation pauses authority issuance
