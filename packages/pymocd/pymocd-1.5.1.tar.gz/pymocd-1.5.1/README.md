**pymocd** is a Python library, powered by a Rust backend, for performing efficient multi-objective evolutionary community detection in complex networks. This library is designed to deliver enhanced performance compared to traditional methods, making it particularly well-suited for analyzing large-scale graphs.

**Navigate the [Documentation](https://oliveira-sh.github.io/pymocd/) for detailed guidance and usage instructions.**

### Understanding Community Detection with HP-MOCD

The `HP-MOCD` algorithm, central to `pymocd`, identifies community structures within a graph. It proposes a solution by grouping nodes into distinct communities, as illustrated below:

| Original Graph                         | Proposed Community Structure             |
| :------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |
|  ![](res/original_graph.png)           | ![](res/proposed_solution.png)           |

### Getting Started

Installing the library using pip interface:

```bash
pip install pymocd
```

For an easy usage:

```python
import networkx
import pymocd

G = networkx.Graph() # Your graph
alg = pymocd.HpMocd(G)
communities = alg.run()
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Graphs must be provided in **NetworkX** or **Igraph** compatible format.

Refer to the official **[Documentation](https://oliveira-sh.github.io/pymocd/)** for detailed instructions and more usage examples.
