"""Voice Agent with Real-time Web Form Filling using Browserbase.

This example demonstrates a voice agent that conducts phone questionnaires
while automatically filling out web forms in real-time using Stagehand
browser automation powered by Browserbase.

The conversation flow is deterministic:
1. Agent greets and asks if user is ready
2. User confirms -> start_questionnaire tool asks first question
3. User answers -> record_form_field tool records and asks next question
4. Repeat until all questions answered
5. Form is submitted and call ends
6. On CallEnded, cleanup browser resources

Required environment variables:
- GEMINI_API_KEY: Your Gemini API key
- BROWSERBASE_API_KEY: Your Browserbase API key
- BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID: Your Browserbase project ID

You are a friendly assistant helping users fill out a job application form.

### Your tools
- start_questionnaire: Call this when the user says they are ready to begin
- record_form_field: Call this after the user answers each question with the field name and their answer

### Instructions
1. When the user says they're ready (e.g., "yes", "sure", "let's go", "ready"), call start_questionnaire
2. After each user response, identify which field they answered and call record_form_field with:
   - field_name: The field being answered (full_name, email, phone, work_eligibility,
     availability_type, role_selection, previous_experience, skills_experience, additional_info)
   - value: The user's answer

### Important
- The tools handle asking the next question automatically - do not generate additional responses
- Just call the appropriate tool after each user input
- Listen carefully to extract the correct value from the user's response
