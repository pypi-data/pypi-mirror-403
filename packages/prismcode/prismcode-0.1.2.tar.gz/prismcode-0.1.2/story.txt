# The Curious Dolphin

Once upon a time, in a warm tropical bay, there lived a young dolphin named Splash.

Splash was different from the other dolphins. While they followed the pod without question, Splash liked to explore. "What lies beyond the reef?" Splash would wonder. "What makes the humans on boats wave at us?"

One day, Splash discovered a sunken ship on the ocean floor. Inside was a treasure chest filled with glittering objects that caught the light. Piece by piece, Splash examined the strange human artifacts.

"I want to find my own treasure," Splash decided.

And so, with powerful flippers and an eager heart, Splash began to explore the vast ocean. The journey wasn't easy—there were strong currents and mysterious shadows—but it was full of wonder.

The pod found Splash the next morning, surrounded by colorful shells and sea glass. They clicked happily.

"Perhaps," the eldest dolphin said, "curiosity is the most precious treasure of all."
