# VC-6 SDK Telemetry Privacy Notice (Supplement to V-Nova Privacy Policy)

This notice explains telemetry collected by the VC-6 SDK (Python/CUDA/OpenCL variants) and how we use it. It supplements the V-Nova Group Privacy Policy.

## Who we are
The Software is published by V-Nova Limited; intellectual property is owned by V-Nova International Limited. For the processing described here, V-Nova Limited acts as controller.

## What we collect
IP address; license key; activation ID; SDK/package version; picture format; resolution; encode count; decode count; timestamp. We do not collect the media/content you process with the Software.

## Why we collect it / lawful basis.
 - Security & anti-abuse (e.g., DDoS/flood protection, rate-limits, incident investigation)
 - Operations & quality (e.g., stability monitoring, compatibility diagnostics, capacity planning)
## Lawful basis - Legitimate interests 
(UK GDPR Art. 6(1)(f)). You may object; see "Your Choices".

## Retention
We keep telemetry only as long as necessary for the purposes above and then delete or aggregate it. In practice: raw security/operational logs are typically retained days to weeks (rarely beyond ~90 days); aggregated, non-identifying metrics up to ~12 months for trends. Longer retention may apply if required by law or for ongoing incident/claims handling.

## Sharing & transfers
Telemetry may be processed by V-Nova Limited and shared within the V-Nova group (including V-Nova International Limited) under safeguards. We use vetted processors for hosting/monitoring under appropriate contracts. If data is transferred outside the UK/EEA, we apply recognised transfer safeguards.

## Security
Encryption in transit, access controls/least privilege, audit logging, and masking/hashing of keys in analytics logs where feasible.

## Your choices
Organisation-level minimisation/opt-out (e.g., IP truncation, hashed identifiers, reduced fields) available on request. Contact legal@v-nova.com.

## Your rights (UK GDPR)
Subject to conditions, rights may include access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, and objection, and the right to complain to the ICO. See our main Privacy Policy for details.
