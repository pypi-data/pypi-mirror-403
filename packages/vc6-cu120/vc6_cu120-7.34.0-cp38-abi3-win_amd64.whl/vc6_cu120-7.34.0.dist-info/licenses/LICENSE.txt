Copyright (c) 2014-2025, V-Nova International Limited.
Published by V-Nova Limited. All rights reserved.

1. Definitions.
"Software" means the VC-6 SDK Python wheel package and any associated binaries, libraries, headers, tools and documentation delivered by V-Nova Limited.
"Licensee" means the person or entity installing or using the Software.

2. Grant. 
Subject to this License, V-Nova Limited grants Licensee a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, time-limited evaluation licence to use the Software in object-code form only, for internal testing, integration and demonstration solely to assess suitability for commercial deployment, for fourteen (14) days from first activation (the "Evaluation Period"). Commercial or production use is not permitted and requires a separate written agreement with V-Nova.

3. Technical time-limit
The Software may include technical measures that count down from first activation and automatically disable functionality when the Evaluation Period ends. Licensee must not circumvent any technical limit, time check, rate-limit or security.

4. Restrictions
Licensee shall not: (a) use the Software in production or for any commercial or revenue-generating purpose; (b) copy, distribute, host, resell or provide the Software to third parties; (c) reverse-engineer, decompile or disassemble, or attempt to derive source code or underlying ideas, except where this restriction is prohibited by applicable law; (d) remove or alter notices or identifiers; (e) publish or disclose benchmarks or performance results without V-Nova's prior written consent; (f) use the Software to create a competing product; (g) bypass evaluation limits.

5. Ownership; no patent licences; feedback.
The Software is licensed, not sold. All intellectual-property rights are owned by V-Nova International Limited. Except for the limited rights granted here, no other rights are granted, including no patent licences. If Licensee provides feedback, Licensee grants V-Nova a worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free licence to use and incorporate it without restriction.

6. Confidentiality
Non-public features, SDK interfaces, documentation and performance data are V-Nova confidential information. Licensee shall protect them with at least reasonable care and use them only as permitted here.


7. Telemetry
The Software may collect limited operational data (e.g., IP address, license/activation identifiers, SDK version, picture format, resolution, encode/decode counts, timestamps) for security and service operation. No media content is collected. Processing is described in PRIVACY.md included with the Software and referenced in the GitHub Release.

8. Warranty disclaimer. 
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITH ALL FAULTS, AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

9. Liability.
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, V-NOVA SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA OR GOODWILL. V-Nova's aggregate liability for direct damages is limited to GBP 1,000. Nothing limits liability that cannot be limited by law.

10. Termination
This License automatically terminates at the end of the Evaluation Period, or immediately upon breach. Upon termination or expiry, Licensee must stop using the Software and destroy all copies and keys. Sections 3-12 survive termination.

11. Export & compliance
 Licensee will comply with applicable export-control, sanctions and technology-control laws and will not use or export the Software in violation of such laws.

12. Governing law
This License and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are governed by the laws of England and Wales, and the courts of England have exclusive jurisdiction.

13. Entire agreement; changes. This License is the entire agreement for evaluation use of the Software and supersedes prior understandings on that subject. No waiver or modification is binding unless in writing signed by V-Nova.
