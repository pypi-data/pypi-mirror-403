        Returns a dictionary of pairings between nodes in the pattern graph and their corresponding matched nodes.

        This property uses graph isomorphism to establish these pairings. Graph isomorphism is a powerful tool for
        identifying structurally identical subgraphs within larger graphs. By leveraging this concept, the parts
        of the original circuit matching the given pattern can be identified, even if they have different node labels
        or edge configurations. Since the found matches already are isomorph to the pattern, the isomorphism function
        is only used to get the mapping between all found matching subgraphs and the pattern.

        One of the main advantages of using graph isomorphism is its **Flexibility**.
        It finds matches between subgraphs with varying node and edge attributes (but with correct instance types in
        the circuit). It can handle minor differences in the structure of the matched subgraphs (such as instance
        names, which are structurally irrelevant), making it more resilient to noise or variations in the data.

        For example, a pattern graph with two nodes 'A' and 'B' connected by an edge. Both nodes are circuit instances
        of a certain type. If the original circuit contains two identical subgraphs with nodes 'X'-'Y' (where X has
        the same type as A, and Y the same as B) and 'P'-'Q' (P.type == A.type and Q.type == B.type), the `pairings`
        property would return a dictionary mapping 'A' to {'0': 'X', '1': 'P'} and 'B' to {'0': 'Y', '1': 'Q'}.

    def get_interfaces(self, circuit_graph: ModuleGraph) -> Dict[int, Dict[Tuple[str, str, int], Set[Tuple[str, str, int]]]]:
        """
        Returns a dictionary of interfaces for each matched subgraph in the original circuit.

        This method constructs an interface for each match by identifying the connections between the matched subgraph
        and the rest of the circuit. The returned dictionary maps each match index to its corresponding interface,
        which is represented as a nested dictionary.


        The interface dictionary has the following structure:
        - The outermost key is the match index (an integer).
        - The next level of keys is a tuple following the schema (`instance_name`, `port_name`, `segment_number`), which
            represents the unique connection point of the current instance, i.e. a port of an instance of the pattern.
        - The values for each connection tuple is a set containing all other end points as tuples with with the given
            port segment is connected via the same wire. The tuple again follows the schema (`opposing_instance_name`,
            `port_of_opposing_instance`, `segment_number`).

        If the key tuple references a driving port, the value set contains all load ports.
        If the key tuple references a load port, the value set conntains all driving ports (which should only be one).
        If the port is dangling (i.e. there is no opposing end point), the port is not listed.

        This way, each connection (with at least one end point inside the pattern) is listed along with every opposing
        end point connected to this port.
        For example, if a match has two instances ('inst1' and 'inst2'), which are connected between each other (via the output
        port 'Y' of 'inst1' and 'A' of 'inst2'), the interface dictionary might look like this:

            {
                0: {
                    ('inst1', 'A', 0): {('inst3', 'Y', 0)},
                    ('inst1', 'B', 0): {('inst4', 'Y', 0)},
                    ('inst1', 'Y', 0): {('inst5', 'D', 0), ('inst2', 'A', 0)},
                    ('inst2', 'A', 0): {('inst1', 'Y', 0)},
                    ('inst2', 'Y', 0): {(None, 'out_port', 0), ('inst6', 'A', 0)},
                },
                1: {
                    ('inst6', 'A', 0): {('inst2', 'Y', 0)},
                    ('inst6', 'Y', 0): {('inst7', 'A', 0)},
                    ('inst7', 'A', 0): {('inst6', 'Y', 0)},
                }
            }

        In this example, `inst1` has three connections outside the pattern, one for each port `A`, `B` and `Y`.
        However, `inst1` also has a connection inside the pattern to `inst2` via its port `Y` (index 0) and the
        port `A` of `inst2` (where the index is 0 again).
        If an instance is connected to a module port, then this connection does not have an instance.
        This can be seen for port `Y` of `inst2`, where the instance name is `None`, indicating that the referenced
        port `out_port` is a module port.
        If a port is missing in the returned dictionary, then this port is unconnected in the circuit.
        Thus there is no corresponding edge in the circuit graph.
        This can be indirectly seen at `inst7`, where only the port `A` is listed and no second port.

        original circuit.
