    This class is a utility class used to create pattern objects from given HDL code,
    circuits, or JSON netlists.

    The method `build_from_circuit` can be used to create a pattern object by providing
    a circuit object, which will be used to find structurally matching subcircuits in a
    larger circuit. In addition a replacement circuit object can be passed as well, which
    is then used to replace any pattern occurrences in the original circuit.
    In this case, both circuits must have the same interface, i.e. the top module must
    have the same input/output ports in both circuits.

    The methods `build_from_verilog` and `build_from_yosys_netlist` work analogously,
    where the pattern and replacement circuits are either specified in Verilog code,
    or as Yosys-generated JSON netlists.
