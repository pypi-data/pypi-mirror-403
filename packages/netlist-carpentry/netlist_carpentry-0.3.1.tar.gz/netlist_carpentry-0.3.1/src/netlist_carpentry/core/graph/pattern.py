class Pattern:
    """
    The Pattern class represents a subgraph pattern in a digital circuit graph.

    It is used to match specific patterns within the graph, allowing for efficient
    identification and manipulation of components or subcircuits. This class is
    essential for tasks such as optimization, verification, and synthesis of digital
    circuits.

    In a graph representing a digital circuit, this class can be used to identify
    common patterns like cascading logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT), or more complex
    components like redundant multiplexers. These patterns help in searching for and
    analyzing specific parts of the circuit, facilitating tasks (e. g. debugging,
    testing and refinement).

    Additionally, this class can also be used to specify a replacement graph that will
    replace the matched pattern in the original graph. This allows for the simplification
    or transformation of digital circuits by replacing complex patterns with simpler ones.

    To use this class, create an instance by providing a subgraph that represents the
    desired pattern and optionally a replacement graph. Then, utilize the provided methods
    to match this pattern within a larger graph representing the digital circuit. If a
    replacement graph is given, it can be used to replace all (or certain) occurrences.

        These metadata are useful for analyzing the connectivity of the circuit graph.

        understand how signals flow through the circuit and make informed decisions about
