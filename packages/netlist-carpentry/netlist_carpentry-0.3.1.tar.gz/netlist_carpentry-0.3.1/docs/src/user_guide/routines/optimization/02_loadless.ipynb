    "# Removing loadless Instances and Wires\n",
    "\n",
    "Netlist Carpentry is capable of removing instances and wires without load.\n",
    "This means if the inputs of an instance are connected to the rest of the circuit, but all outputs are unused (i.e. directly unconnected, or the connected wire itself has no load).\n",
    "In such case, the instance (or pontentially the whole instance subbranch) can be removed.\n",
    "Consider the following graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "flowchart LR\n",
    "    In1([Input 1])\n",
    "    In2([Input 2])\n",
    "    In3([Input 3])\n",
    "    Gate1{{AND Gate 1}}\n",
    "    Gate2{{AND Gate 2}}\n",
    "    Gate3{{NOT Gate 3.1}}\n",
    "    Gate4{{NOT Gate 3.2}}\n",
    "    Out1([Output])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In1 --> Gate1\n",
    "    In2 --> Gate1\n",
    "    In2 --> Gate2\n",
    "    In3 --> Gate2\n",
    "    Gate2 --> Out1\n",
    "    In3 --> Gate3\n",
    "    Gate3 --> Gate4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The gate `AND Gate 1` does not have any load on its output and can thus be removed from the module.\n",
    "In contrast, the output of `AND Gate 2` is connected to the module output and thus necessary for the module to behave correctly.\n",
    "In the third case, two NOT gates are used, where `NOT Gate 3.1` has a load, which is `NOT Gate 3.2`, but the latter has no load.\n",
    "Accordingly, both instances could be removed as well.\n",
    "As a result, the optimized structure would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "flowchart LR\n",
    "    In1([Input 1])\n",

    "Now to start the optimization algorithm to remove the loadless instances and wires, there are two approaches.\n",
    "The easiest is to execute `Module.optimize`, which runs a bunch of optimizations, with the removal of loadless elements being one of them.\n",
    "However, to only execute the optimization task to remove loadless instances and wires, a corresponding function can be imported directly from the corresponding module `routines.opt.loadless`, as shown in the cell below.\n",
    "The method `opt_loadless` will recursively remove all loadless wires and instance until no loadless wires and instances are left.\n",
