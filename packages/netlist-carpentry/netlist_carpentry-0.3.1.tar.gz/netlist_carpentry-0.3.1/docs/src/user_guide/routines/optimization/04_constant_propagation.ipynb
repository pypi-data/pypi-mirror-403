    "# Constant Propagation with Netlist Carpentry\n",
    "\n",
    "Constant propagation is a pretty useful optimization technique where signals that are tied to fixed logic values (0 or 1) are substituted directly into the circuit.\n",
    "This enables the simplification of logic expressions.\n",
    "It also removes gates whose outputs become predetermined, reducing circuit area, power, and overall delay.\n",
    "Consider the following example structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "flowchart LR\n",
    "    In1([Input: 1])\n",
    "    In2([Input: 0])\n",
    "    Gate{{AND Gate}}\n",
    "    SomeWire([SomeWire: 0])\n",
    "    SubModule{{Some Submodule}}\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In1 --> Gate\n",
    "    In2 --> Gate\n",
    "    Gate --> SomeWire\n",
    "    SomeWire --> SubModule\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the inputs of the AND Gate are tied to 0 and 1 respectively, it is obvious that the output will always be 0 as well.\n",
    "Accordingly, the AND Gate may be removed and the corresponding input of the downstream submodule instance can be tied to 0.\n",
    "This removes unnecessary instances and reduces circuit area and power consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "flowchart LR\n",
    "    SomeWire((0))\n",
    "    SubModule{{Some Submodule}}\n",
    "\n",
    "    SomeWire --> SubModule\n",
    "```\n",
