    "# Removing driverless Instances and Wires\n",
    "\n",
    "Netlist Carpentry is capable of removing instances and wires without driver.\n",
    "This happens if all inputs of an instance are unconnected.\n",
    "In such case, the instance (or pontentially the whole instance subbranch) can be removed and the downstream load inputs will be unconnected as well.\n",
    "Consider the following graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "flowchart LR\n",
    "    In1([Input])\n",
    "    Gate1{{NOT Gate 1}}\n",
    "    Gate2{{NOT Gate 2}}\n",
    "    Gate3{{AND Gate 3}}\n",
    "    Gate4{{AND Gate 4}}\n",
    "    Out1([Output])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In1 --> Gate2\n",
    "    Gate1 --> Gate3\n",
    "    Gate2 --> Gate4\n",
    "    Gate3 --> Gate4\n",
    "    Gate4 --> Out1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second port of the `AND Gate 4` (the lower arm) is driven by `AND Gate 3`, which itself only has one input port connected, to `NOT Gate 1`, which does not have a driver.\n",
    "The whole \"instance chain\" is thus undriven.\n",
    "This can be simplified down to `AND Gate 4`, which is the \"root\" of this branch and has at least one input connected to a module port.\n",
    "Accordingly, both `NOT Gate 1` and `AND Gate 3` could be removed, and the port of `AND Gate 4`, where previously the output of `AND Gate 3` was, will now be unconnected.\n",
    "As a result, the optimized structure would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "flowchart LR\n",
    "    In1([Input])\n",
    "    Gate2{{NOT Gate 2}}\n",
    "    Gate4{{AND Gate 4}}\n",
    "    Out1([Output])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In1 --> Gate2\n",
    "    Gate2 --> Gate4\n",
    "    Gate4 --> Out1\n",

    "Now to start the optimization algorithm to remove the driverless instances and wires, there are two approaches.\n",
    "The easiest is to execute `Module.optimize`, which runs a bunch of optimizations, with the removal of driverless elements being one of them.\n",
    "However, to only execute the optimization task to remove driverless instances and wires, a corresponding function can be imported directly from the corresponding module `routines.opt.driverless`, as shown in the cell below.\n",
    "The method `opt_driverless` will recursively remove all driverless wires and instances until no driverless wires and instances are left.\n",
