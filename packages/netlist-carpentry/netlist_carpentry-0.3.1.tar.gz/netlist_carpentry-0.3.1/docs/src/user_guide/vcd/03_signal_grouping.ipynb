    "# Grouping Signals based on behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable simulation-assisted optimization, the idea is to analyze the signal behavior extracted from VCD waveforms.\n",
    "For this, signals may be grouped, if they toggle together, i.e. they always have the same signal.\n",
    "Accordingly, they can be combined, and the circuit design could possibly be simplified.\n",
    "However, if only a single VCD waveform is analyzed, there may be signals that have the same values, but only coincidentally.\n",
    "In order to achieve meaningful signal grouping, it is therefore advisable to perform several runs (for example, with different test benches).\n",
    "This notebook shows how to group signals based on their behavior.\n",
    "This does not necessarily require a circuit object as this is plain VCD waveform analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first step is to collect the VCD files.\n",
    "It is advisable to have the VCD files located in the same directory, for a simple read in.\n",
    "In this example, the VCD files are located in `../path/to/vcd/files` (replace this with your own VCD file directory).\n",
    "The first step is to sort the VCD files by size.\n",
    "Although it might seem counterintuitive, it makes sense to read the largest VCD file first (and sort the file list accordingly).\n",
    "The heuristic is that in a larger VCD file, there is more activity, and it is thus more likely that signal groups can be identified earlier in the grouping process.\n",
    "If a signal does not have another signal toggling together with the first, this signal can be directly removed from the consideration, as it is evidently unique.\n",
    "By analyzing the largest file first, a large section of signals will be eliminated directly in the first iteration, reducing the overall workload and runtime."
