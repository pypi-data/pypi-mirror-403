    "# VCD Basics - Reading VCD files\n",
    "\n",
    "A VCD (Value Change Dump) file is a text-based format used to record signal value changes over time, starting with a header that defines metadata (e.g. the used timescale), and signal declarations.\n",
    "Signals are declared using unique identifiers within a hierarchical scope, mapping human-readable names to compact symbols (e.g. a signal `CLK` becomes `^`, `RESET` becomes `!`).\n",
    "After the header, the value change section lists timestamped updates that show how each signal’s value changes as simulation time advances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulating testbenches and dumping all signal traces to VCD format, it enables simulation-assisted optimization.\n",
    "This is done e.g. by extracting the signal traces and comparing them against each other, to find signals that always have the same values and thus form *signal groups*.\n",
    "If only a single VCD file is considered, these signals may have been only coincidentally equal all the time.\n",
    "The more different VCD data from test bench runs are analyzed, the more meaningful the individual signal groups become.\n",
    "\n",
    "Signals of a signal group may be interchangeable, i.e. all signals but one of the group can be replaced by the remaining signal.\n",
    "Using a Logic Equivalence Check (e.g. using Yosys EQY), this transformation can be matched against the original circuit to prove whether the replaced signal(s) truly are functionally equivalent.\n",
    "If they are still equivalent, the transformation is valid.\n",
    "This transformation may allow for further simplifications (i.e. removing now-unused logic, that was related to the removed signals).\n",
    "Accordingly, the number of wires and instances withing the circuit may be reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, some basic functionality is shown on how to handle VCD files and apply simulation data to circuit elements.\n",
    "Subsequently it is shown how to use these informations to automatically extract signal groups from the simulation data for optimization.\n",
    "A simple example VCD file is given in `files/sim/tb_adder_basics.vcd`, which was generated by simulating the testbench `files/sim/tb.sv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"admonition info alert alert-info\">\n",
    "  <strong>Info:</strong> For reading the VCD data, the python library <b>pywellen</b> is used internally.\n",
    "  The actual objects from pywellen are wrapped into classes in the <i>io.vcd</i> package.\n",
