    "# Handling Module Graphs\n",
    "Modules can be interpreted as graphs.\n",
    "In this case the nodes are instances and module ports and the edges represent connections between them (i.e. wires).\n",
    "Since instances can have multiple connections between each other and each wire has a direction (from driver to load), the module graph is a directed, multi-edged graph.\n",
    "This is implemented using [MultiDiGraphs from NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/multidigraph.html).\n",
    "This notebook shows how to handle module graphs.\n",

    "## Building and Retrieving the Graph\n",
    "- The module graph can be build using `Module.graph()`, which depending on the size of the module may take a couple of seconds.\n",
    "- Every subsequent execution will however return the previously built graph, as long as the module did not change structurally -- in this case, the graph is rebuilt, which again take some seconds.\n",
    "- Execute the cell below to build the graph for inspection.\n",

    "<div class=\"admonition info alert alert-info\">\n",
