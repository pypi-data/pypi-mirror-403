    "# Custom Search and Replace\n",

    "As an example the Verilog design files for the [openMSP430](https://github.com/olgirard/openmsp430) project are used.\n",
    "The design has a sufficiently large complexity and hierarchy to demonstrate the usage of the framework on a larger design.\n",
    "To use this notebook, the design files of the openMSP430 must be cloned from the repository and then pre-processed using Yosys to retrieve a unified design (in the form of a generic netlist), where all modules are defined in a single file.\n",
