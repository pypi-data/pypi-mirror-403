# Netlist Carpentry

Netlist Carpentry is a Python library that allows you to access and modify a digital circuit in an accessible way.
It covers the following use cases:

* Navigate through your circuit and introduce custom checks
* Create a new algorithm that does some new optimization with your circuit
* ...

It uses [Yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) to get the circuit from a behavioral code and converts it into a pythonic structure along with a [networkx graph](https://networkx.org).
This allows for using standard graph algorithms on the circuit as well as pretty-printing facilities.

Once in Python, the structure can be examined and modified.
Netlist carpentry internally tracks all the changes and lets you write out your modified circuit to Verilog.
The output Verilog file can then be used with most commons simulation or synthesis tools (e.g. Yosys or IVerilog).

Example:
```python
import netlist_carpentry

# Load your Circuit
circuit = netlist_carpentry.read("simpleAdder.v")
# Define your top module
circuit.set_top('simpleAdder')

print(f"The top module '{top_module.name}' has the following items:")
for instance_name, instance_object in top_module.instances.items():
    print(f"\tInstance '{instance_name}'.")

for port_name, port_object in top_module.ports.items():
    print(f"\tPort '{port_name}', which is an {port_object.direction} port and {port_object.width} bit wide!")

for wire_name, wire_object in top_module.wires.items():
    print(f"\tWire '{wire_name}', which is {wire_object.width} bit wide!")
```

Netlist carpentry is designed for making the access to the circuit as easy as possible. The runtime-performance was not always in focus -- so don't expect it to work as fast as a custom-knitted C++ software. If you want to propose changes, please submit an issue or even a pull request.


## Installation

Install the package via...

```bash
pip install netlist-carpentry
```

... and have fun!

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and install the package in editable mode.


The package is tested thoroughly on Python 3.12 and works stable with this version.
The package requires at least Python 3.9.

## Examples
The examples are located in `docs/src/user_guide` along with the documentation.
