The core package of Netlist Carpentry.

The whole internal structure can be found here, completely irrespective of the input format.
All data structures (from toplevel class `Circuit`) down to basic elements (`WireSegment`, i.e. a slice of a wire)
and meta-elements (classes like `Signal` mimicking a signal state or `Direction` for handling port directions) can be found here.
