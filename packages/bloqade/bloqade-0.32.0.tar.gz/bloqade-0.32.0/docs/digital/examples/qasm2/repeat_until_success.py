# # Repeat Until Success with STAR Gadget
# In this example, we will demonstrate a near-term fault tolerant gadget
# which is a repeat-until-success protocol to implement a Z phase gate
# using a resource state (similar to a T state), Pauli gates, and feed-forward measurement.

# This example highlights a few interesting capabilities of having a full kernel structure with
# runtime control flow. One example is the ability to dynamically allocate qubits, possibly
# based on previous run-time measurement outcomes.
#
# In this case, we prepare a resource state, which is a generalization of the T state with
# an arbitrary Z rotation $|0\rangle + e^{i\theta}|1\rangle$.

# Using this resource state, we can teleport the Z phase gate to a target qubit using
# only Clifford gates, which are much easier to implement fault-tolerantly.
# This is implemented by first applying a CNOT gate controlled by the resource state
# on the target qubit, then measuring the target qubit in the computational basis.
# If the measurement outcome is 1 (which occurs with 50% probability), the gadget
# executed a Z(theta) gate on the target qubit and teleported it
# to the new resource state.
#
# However, if the measurement outcome is 0 (which occurs with 50% probability),
# we apply an X gate, and the gadget executed a Z(-theta) gate on the target qubit.
# In order to correct this gate, we must apply a Z(+2*theta) gate on the new target state.
# Of course, we can apply this Z(+2*theta) gate by applying the same gadget with twice
# the angle, and repeat until we get the correct outcome.

# %% [markdown]
# The simplest way to implement the gadget is to simply post-select the correct measurement outcome
# using an assert statement. This is straightforward, but comes with an exponential overhead in the
# number of resource states: there is a 50% chance of success at each step, so there is only a
# $2^{-n}$ chance of success after $n$ Z phase gates.
