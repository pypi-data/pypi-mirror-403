# # Circuits with Bloqade
#
# In this tutorial we will demonstrate how to write circuits and quantum executions with Bloqade. Specifically, we will use the `squin` dialect set from the compiler toolchain `kirin`. `SQUIN` stands for `S`tructural `Qu`antum `IN`struction set and is the circuit-level representation of quantum executions. It is built on top of the `kirin` framework, an [open-source compiler toolchain](https://queracomputing.github.io/kirin/latest/) for embedded domain-specific languages (eDSLs) that target scientific computing kernels. A key feature of squin is the _kernel_, which can roughly be seen as the object which will be executed on the target hardware. Naturally, this hardware could be a quantum computer, but it also extends to classical execution as well, such as mid-circuit feedforward or even non-quantum execution such as robotics.
#
# These kernels can be built using decorators of python functions. We will use the `@squin.kernel` decorator in this notebook but keep in mind that other eDSLs have different decorators inherited from base Kirin decorators. The decorator lowers Python's abstract syntax tree (AST) into a kirin SSA (single static assignment) form, which is a useful intermediate representation for compiler analysis. You don't have to worry too much about SSA or compilers here, but if you want to learn more check out the [kirin documentation](https://queracomputing.github.io/kirin/latest/).

# ### Anatomy of a Bloqade kernel
#
# A kernel is a representation of a hybrid quantum/classical execution that will run "on hardware". The decorator @squin.kernel can be considered as the "label" to represent this fact. A kernel can take arguments (such as `theta` here) and can return values (such as `bits` here). To help the compiler, the inputs and outputs must be decorated with a type. The return values can be considered as the "results" which are returned from the quantum computer, though they can also be intermediate values that are used as a part of a larger computation (e.g. a function call). A kernel can represent both quantum and classical execution: while lots of classical computation is supported (control flow, algebra, etc.) there is less support for arbitrary python calls, as this won't necessarily be supported on the microcontroller "on hardware". Note that shot-level execution and averaging is handled outside of the kernel itself: averaging over multiple shots within a kernel is an anti-pattern to avoid.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Squin kernel statements
#
# To represent quantum executions, we write and construct squin kernels.
# These kernels can use the typical structure of python functions -- inputs, outputs, for loops, control flow, subroutines, and so forth -- as a feature of the underlying base Kirin statements.
# Because one can intermix control flow with operations and measurement, arbitrary mid-circuit feed forward comes for "free".
#
# There are three dialects that comprise the domain-specific language
# 1. `squin.qubit` - Manipulation and declaration of the qubits themselves, mainly allocating new ones and measuring them.
# 2. `squin.gate` - Application of quantum gates on qubits.
# 3. `squin.noise` - Representing noise effects on the qubits.
#
# While you can interact with `squin.qubit` directly, the other two dialects are exposed via wrapper functions that are available directly under the `squin` namespace, or under `squin.broadcast` for parallelized versions of the gates and noise processes, respectively.
#
# Refer to the [API documentation](../../../reference/bloqade-circuit/src/bloqade/squin/stdlib/simple/gate) for a full list of the available functionality.
# Note that you are also able to define your own custom gates by defining similar functions.


# %% [markdown]
# # Using Bloqade kernels
# A key feature of kernels is the ability to do complex control flow similar to how one might program python. For example, one can use a for loop to apply the same gate to multiple qubits to prepare a GHZ state.
#
# A useful pattern is to use factory functions that return bloqade kernels. This way, you can fix parameters (such as the number of qubits) pythonically without needing to introduce the variable directly into the kernel itself, using a closure.

# ## Building circuits in Cirq
# Instead of writing your circuit directly in bloqade, you may build circuits using Cirq and then lower them to and from bloqade kernels. This has the advantage of being able to leverage the excellent and in-depth resources of transpilation and circuit optimization without having to reinvent the wheel. However, for certain programs, such as those requiring more complex mid-circuit feed-forward, it is still required to write bloqade kernels as there is no adequate representation in other SDKs. Cirq is our initial choice of SDK, and other transformations are coming soon-- though in principle interoperability with many SDK is possible through an intermediate Cirq representation.
#
# Let us begin by writing a simple GHZ state preparation circuit, in analogy to the bloqade kernel above. Observe that the resulting object is a static representation of a circuit, similar to the `GHZ_state` kernel, and differentiated from the dynamic `GHZ_state_factory` kernel which can return a dynamically sized GHZ state.

# ## Simulation, emulation, and analysis
#
# A kernel is simply a representation of an execution and is not much use without being able to analyze and execute that kernel. We can simulate the action of kernels using concrete interpreters. The emulator must a) keep track of the classical state of the variables, b) keep track of the quantum state of the qubits, and thus c) faithfully represent the execution of that program as if it was run on a hybrid quantum/classical computer. Bloqade's emulator is built on top of the excellent [PyQrack quantum simulator](https://pyqrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and satisfies the three goals above.
#
# There are four main objects when considering simulation:
# 1. **The emulator object** - Representing the thing that some kernel is going to be executed on. Today it is the PyQrack simulator, but eventually it could also include other simulators or physical hardware. The `*.task` method of the `emulator` object builds a `task` object.
# 2. **The task object** - Binding together the emulator, kernel, and input parameters for that kernel. This task is not executed until the `*.run` method is called. Upon calling `run`, the kernel is interpreted, the quantum circuit is executed, any classical co-processing is done, and the kernel completes, returning . Repeated calling of `run` will "reset" the executor into its initial state and rerun the kernel. Alternatively, one could call `*.batch_run` to repeatedly run the kernel's result to get stochastic averaging. Products of the task include the `results` and `QuantumState` objects.
# 3. **The results object** - Whatever the `return` of the kernel is returned, with the same type signature. This is generated from `*run()` (as a ResultType) or `*.batch_run` (as a dict keyed by ResultType and valued by frequency) These could be qubits or qubit registers (list of qubits), values, or whatever object you like.
# 4. **The QuantumState object** - The final quantum state of the emulator object. While this is a nonphysical quantity, the QuantumState is useful for debugging and analysis. This can be extracted from either the `emulator.quantum_state` method (for a single run after the `run()` method), or with `task.batch_state` (for a stochastic average over many samples). The quantum state is efficiently represented as an eigensystem of a reduced density matrix.

from bloqade.pyqrack import StackMemorySimulator, DynamicMemorySimulator

# StackMemorySimulator - static number of qubits
# DynamicMemorySimulator - dynamic number of qubits, but slower. Use if you don't know how many qubits you need in advance.
emulator = StackMemorySimulator(min_qubits=8)

task = emulator.task(GHZ_state_factory, args=(4,))
results = task.run()
# The results are the same ResultType as the kernel return.
# In this case, it is a list of qubits.
print(results)
# %% [markdown]
# Note that, while it is instinctive to simply call `GHZ_state_factory(4)` and expect it to run, this isn't necessarily the correct abstraction. `emulator.task` links the kernel to a specific interpreter-- for example, if you wanted to run your program on a noisy emulator vs a perfect emulator vs. real hardware, this is the way you would specify it. Furthermore, the _instantiation_ of the task is not necessarily linked with the _execution_ of that task. For example, if that task must be run asynchronously on hardware, there must be an object which represents the run itself as well as the (future) results.
#
# For simpler kernels that only use kirin built-in statements -- such as control flow, for loops, arithmetic, and the like -- it is possible to directly call the kernel and use the default Kirin interpreter.

# ## Extracting quantum states
#
# PyQRack is mainly intended as an *emulator*, attempting to recreate the physical action and interaction of quantum hardware with classical controls. However, it is often useful for user analysis and debugging to extract out non-physical values, such as the quantum statevector, fidelity, or exact expectation values of observables and correlation functions.
#
# These nonphysical values are based in being able to directly observe and evaluate the quantum state. The state can be extracted via the `PyQrackSimulator.quantum_state` method, with an input signature of a list of (pyqrack) qubits. These qubits can be generated as a return value from a kernel (as is the case for the `GHZ_state_factory` function) or from the `task.qubits()` method.
#
# The resulting state is a reduced density matrix represented by its eigensystem of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, or a dense $2^N \times 2^N$ array.
# %%
from bloqade.pyqrack import PyQrackQubit

# This kernel returns a list of Qubit objects. We can use these to analyze the
# quantum state of the register.
results: list[PyQrackQubit] = task.run()

# If the kernel does not return the qubit register, one can still collect it. Note that
# it is now the onus of you, the user, to determine which qubits are which.
# Qubits are typically added sequentially, so if you make multiple registers, the qubits
# will be in the order they were added. The StackMemorySimulator may have extra qubits.
qubits: list[PyQrackQubit] = task.qubits()

# Extract the quantum state as a reduced density matrix. Note that he qubits themselves
# point to the internal state of the emulator
state = emulator.quantum_state(results)
density_matrix = emulator.reduced_density_matrix(results)

# Note that the RDM is represented in its eigenbasis for efficiency.
# If the state is pure, there is only one nonzero eigenvalue. This is the case for the GHZ state.

# ### Constant depth GHZ state
#
# Remarkably, it is also possible to prepare a GHZ state with a constant number of gates. At first glance, this seems impossible: quantum information can only propagate as fast as the information lightcone, and so a constant depth circuit can only have a small amount of entanglement—not enough to prepare the long-range correlated GHZ state. The trick is, we can replace quantum gates with ancillas and classical feedforward measurements so that the information is propagated classically instead of quantumly. For more details, check out [1] and [2].

# As a final note, consider how difficult it would be to represent this circuit in Cirq. In particular, there is a for loop, where inside the for loop there is an algebraic operation (XOR) that feeds forward onto a variable (parity). This circuit is very hard to express in Cirq without some serious hacking of ancilla registers.
