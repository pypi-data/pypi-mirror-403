# Hypercrystal

Hyperbolic geometry utilities and visualizations for experiments, prototyping and research. The library exposes math primitives, projection models, shapes, and camera abstractions that power real-time hyperbolic rendering in H².

## Install

```bash
pip install hypercrystal
```

For local development:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
