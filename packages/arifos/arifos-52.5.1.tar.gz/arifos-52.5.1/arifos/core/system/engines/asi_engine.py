"""
asi_engine.py - ASI (Auditor) (Omega Engine) Facade

ASI (Auditor) is the Heart/Warm Logic engine of the AGI·ASI·APEX Trinity.
Role: Empathy, tone, stability - homeostatic regulation

Pipeline stages owned:
- 555 EMPATHIZE - Apply warm logic, protect vulnerable
- 666 BRIDGE - Reality test, cultural bridge

Constraints (from canon):
- Must enforce Peace^2 >= 1.0 (non-escalation)
- Must enforce kappa_r >= 0.95 (weakest-listener empathy)
- Must maintain Omega_0 in [0.03, 0.05] humility band
- Cannot modify factual content (ΔS lock)
- Cannot seal, override, or decide - hands off to APEX PRIME
- Must not claim genuine emotions (Anti-Hantu)
