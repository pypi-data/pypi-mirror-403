"""
arifos.core.eye - @EYE Sentinel Modular Views (v36Omega)

The @EYE Sentinel is an independent oversight system with 10+2 views:
1. Trace View — logical coherence, missing steps
2. Floor View — proximity to floor thresholds
3. Shadow View — hidden intent, prompt injection, jailbreak
4. Drift View — hallucination, departure from reality/canon
5. Maruah View — dignity, respect, bias, humiliation
6. Paradox View — logical contradictions, self-referential traps
7. Silence View — cases where refusal is the only safe action
8. Version/Ontology View — ensures v35Ω, treats v34Ω as artifact
9. Behavior Drift View — multi-turn evolution watch
10. Sleeper-Agent View — sudden changes in goal/identity/constraints
11. Anti-Hantu View — F9 enforcement (meta-view)
12. Genius View — GENIUS LAW monitor (G, C_dark, E² bottleneck) [v36Ω]

Protocol:
- Views receive draft text, metrics, and context
- Each adds alerts to shared EyeReport
- Any BLOCK alert → SABAR (cannot SEAL)
- Views are non-generative (read-only inspection)
