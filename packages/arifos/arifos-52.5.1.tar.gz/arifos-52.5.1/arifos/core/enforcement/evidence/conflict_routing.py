"""
arifOS v46 - Conflict Routing (Sovereign Witness)
Deterministic routing based on physics attributes.

ARCHITECTURAL CLARIFICATION:
This module returns ROUTING RECOMMENDATIONS based on evidence quality.
It does NOT issue constitutional verdicts - only APEX PRIME has that authority.

v46 Refactor: Replaced Verdict enum with RoutingSignal to enforce architectural clarity.
