"""
arifOS v45 - Witness Council (Sovereign Witness)
Federated Tri-Witness Consensus Engine.
Enforces Law 5 (Re-Witness or Release) and Law 6 (Memory != Authority).

Architectural note (v46): This module aggregates witness votes into a consensus signal,
but it does NOT issue the final constitutional verdict. Only APEX PRIME
(`arifos.core.system.apex_prime.apex_review`) may SEAL.

    TODO(v46): Architectural Review - Verdict Authority
    This consensus engine creates Verdict enums by aggregating witness votes.
    While this is consensus mathematics (not independent judgment), it still
    produces verdicts outside apex_review(). Consider architectural pattern:
    - Option A: Witnesses call apex_review() before voting (verdicts pre-validated)
    - Option B: Consensus result feeds into apex_review() for final validation
    - Option C: Consensus layer is exempt (mathematical aggregation, not judgment)
    Current: Creates Verdict.VOID, Verdict.HOLD_888, Verdict.PARTIAL directly.
