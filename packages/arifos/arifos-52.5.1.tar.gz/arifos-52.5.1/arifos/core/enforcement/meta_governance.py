"""
meta_governance.py — Cross-Model Tri-Witness Aggregator (v45.1)

This module implements the "Governor of Governors" pattern:
- Multiple AI models vote on a decision
- Votes are weighted by confidence
- Consensus threshold determines final verdict

Usage:
    from arifos.core.enforcement.meta_governance import meta_select, WitnessVote

    votes = [
        WitnessVote(witness_id="claude", preference="B", confidence=0.95, reason="HOLD purity"),
        WitnessVote(witness_id="gpt", preference="B", confidence=0.90, reason="Truth unverifiable"),
        WitnessVote(witness_id="gemini", preference="B", confidence=0.92, reason="Lower heat"),
    ]

    result = meta_select(votes, high_stakes=True)
    print(result)  # MetaVerdict with consensus and final decision
