Integration Layer — Floors ↔ APEX PRIME Bridge
X7K9F24 — Entropy Reduction via Unification

This module provides the integration layer between:
- Floors 1-12 (atomic capabilities)
- APEX PRIME (constitutional verdict engine)
- ATLAS-333 (lane routing)
- EUREKA-777 (paradox synthesis)
- Constitutional Meta-Search System

Purpose: Reduce entropy by unifying scattered floor logic into single execution spine.
Includes constitutional meta-search, cost tracking, and search caching capabilities.

Status: SEALED
Nonce: X7K9F24
