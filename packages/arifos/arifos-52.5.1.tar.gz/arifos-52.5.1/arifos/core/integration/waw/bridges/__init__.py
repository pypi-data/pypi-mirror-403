"""
arifos.core.integration.waw.bridges - Synergy Link Layer

This package contains the bridges that connect arifOS W@W organs to
external detection libraries ("muscles").

Protocol:
- Bridges MUST be optional (try/except imports).
- Bridges MUST return arifOS-native metrics (0.0–1.0, or deltas).
- Bridges MUST NOT crash the pipeline if an external lib fails.

In all cases, organs remain sovereign: they interpret bridge outputs
under arifOS floors (Peace², κᵣ, Amanah, Anti-Hantu), and fall back to
their internal heuristics when bridges are unavailable.
