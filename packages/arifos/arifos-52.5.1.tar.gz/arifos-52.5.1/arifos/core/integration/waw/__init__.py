"""
arifos.core.waw - W@W Federation Constitutional Organs (v35Omega)

The five-organ constitutional execution layer of arifOS.
Each organ evaluates outputs from its domain and returns PASS/WARN/VETO.

Organs:
- @WELL  - Somatic safety, tone, emotional stability (Peace², κᵣ)
- @RIF   - Logic, clarity, entropy reduction (ΔS, Truth)
- @WEALTH - Integrity, dignity, justice (Amanah, maruah)
- @GEOX  - Physics, feasibility, reality (E_earth, Tri-Witness)
- @PROMPT - Language, culture, expression (Anti-Hantu, RASA)

Protocol:
- Organs receive AAA outputs and metrics
- Each returns OrganSignal with vote (PASS/WARN/VETO) + evidence
- Aggregated signals feed into APEX PRIME at 888

Constraints:
- Organs CANNOT self-seal or override floors
- VETO escalates to APEX PRIME, does not directly VOID
- @WEALTH has absolute veto power (Amanah LOCK violation → immediate VOID)
