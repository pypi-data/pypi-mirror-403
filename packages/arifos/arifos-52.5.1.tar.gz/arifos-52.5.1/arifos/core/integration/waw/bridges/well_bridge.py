"""
well_bridge.py - Optional bridge for @WELL (somatic safety)

This module provides a thin, optional integration layer between the
@WELL organ and external detection libraries (e.g. guardrails-ai,
langkit, or similar).

Design goals:
- Optional: If external libs are not installed, the bridge returns None.
- Sovereign: The bridge NEVER decides verdicts; it only returns metrics.
- Stable: Any import / runtime failure is caught and surfaced as None.

Interface:

    bridge = WellBridge()
    result = bridge.analyze(output_text, context)

    result is either:
        None  -> bridge unavailable or disabled
        dict  -> {
            "peace2_delta": float,   # additive adjustment to Peace²
            "kappa_r_delta": float,  # additive adjustment to κᵣ
            "issues": List[str],     # textual notes for logging
        }

The @WELL organ remains free to ignore or reinterpret these signals
under arifOS floors (Peace², κᵣ) and Anti-Hantu law.
