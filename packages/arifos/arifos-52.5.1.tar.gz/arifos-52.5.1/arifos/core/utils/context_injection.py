"""
context_injection.py

Stage 111 support module for injecting grounding context into LLM calls.

This module centralises "ground truth" definitions for domain-specific terms
that are unlikely to exist in a model's pre-training data (e.g. arifOS,
Arif Fazil, Anti-Hantu).

Callers (scripts, adapters, engines) can use `build_system_context` to
construct a system-level prefix that is prepended to the LLM prompt so that
governance-critical concepts are described accurately.

# These strings should be treated as canonical for runtime behaviour. If the
# canonical definition changes, update this module and the relevant canon/spec.
