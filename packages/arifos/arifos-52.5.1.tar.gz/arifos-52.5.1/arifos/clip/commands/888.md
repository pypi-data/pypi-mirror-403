# 888 hold

**Description:** Triggers a HOLD on the pipeline. The "hold" stage is used to pause or block the process when an issue is detected or a manual review is required before proceeding.

**Usage:** `888 hold [--reason "<reason text>"]`

Invoking this command creates a HOLD bundle under `.arifos_clip/holds/` (including `hold.json` and `hold.md`) and sets the session status to HOLD. Once a hold is active, the pipeline cannot be sealed until the hold is resolved by human intervention.
