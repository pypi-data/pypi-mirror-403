# A CLIP Agents & Roles

A CLIP employs multiple cognitive "agents" or perspectives to examine a problem thoroughly. Each intermediate stage (111–666) can be thought of as a distinct role or mindset:

- **Sense (111): The Observer.** Gathers raw context and facts.
- **Reflect (222): The Historian.** Recalls and reflects on past knowledge and context.
- **Reason (333): The Logician.** Applies logic and analysis to form conclusions.
- **Evidence (444): The Analyst.** Verifies claims with data and evidence.
- **Empathize (555): The Empath.** Considers human factors and stakeholder perspectives.
- **Align (666): The Guardian.** Ensures alignment with core values, ethics, and laws.

These agents work together under the APEX governance framework to ensure decisions are well-rounded and compliant. The profiles and guidelines for key agents are detailed in the `agents/` directory.
