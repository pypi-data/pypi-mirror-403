"""
Orthogonality Guard - Runtime Measurement of AGI ⊥ ASI Independence

Constitutional Principle:
- AGI (Mind) and ASI (Heart) must execute independently
- dot_product(AGI, ASI) = 0 (no shared state, no coupling)
- Ω_ortho ≥ 0.95 (orthogonality index threshold)

If coupling detected (Ω_ortho < 0.95):
- Log constitutional violation
- Trigger SABAR protocol after N consecutive violations
- Escalate to human authority

Authority: v47 Constitutional Law Section 8 (Quantum Orthogonality Mandate)
Implementation: Engineer (Ω) under governance directive
