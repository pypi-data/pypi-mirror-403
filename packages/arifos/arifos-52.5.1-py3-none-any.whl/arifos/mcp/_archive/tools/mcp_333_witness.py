"""
333_WITNESS: Tri-Witness Collection & Signature.

A tool for independent observers to sign off on pending actions.
Implements F3 (Tri-Witness Consensus) + F6 (Ijma / Consensus).

When a high-risk action (666_act, resource deletion, etc.) is queued,
observers can inspect the request and sign with their own authority.
