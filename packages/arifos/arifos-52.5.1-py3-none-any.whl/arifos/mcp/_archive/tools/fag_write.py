    Validate a write operation with constitutional governance (FAG).

    Enforces the FAG Write Contract:
    - Rule 1: Canon Lock (000_THEORY is immutable)
    - Rule 2: No New Files (outside sandbox/allowlist)
    - Rule 3: Delete Gate (requires human approval)
    - Rule 4: Read Before Write (verifiable read proof required)
    - Rule 5: Patch Only (no full file rewrites)
    - Rule 6: Rewrite Threshold (max 30% deletion)
    - v45.0.3: Mutation Watchdog (anomaly detection)
    - v45.0.3: Pre-Mutate Snapshot (rollback contract)
