"""
MCP Tool: tempa_write (vTEMPA External)

Exposes FAG.write_validate() as external MCP tool for constitutional write validation.
vTEMPA = Governed File Access for External MCP (formerly FAG for internal).

Constitutional Floors Enforced:
    F1 Amanah - Root jail, reversible changes only
    F4 ΔS - Patch must reduce entropy
    F5 Peace² - Non-destructive by default
    F9 C_dark - Block writes to forbidden patterns

CRITICAL: This tool NEVER auto-executes writes.
All writes return HOLD for human approval (F1 Amanah compliance).

Version: v45.3.0

    Validate file write with constitutional governance (FAG).

    IMPORTANT: This tool validates write plans but NEVER executes them.
    All writes require human approval per F1 Amanah.

    Enforces constitutional floors:
    - F1 Amanah: Root jail enforcement, reversible changes only
    - F4 ΔS: Patch must not increase entropy (no massive rewrites)
    - F5 Peace²: Non-destructive by default
    - F9 C_dark: Block writes to forbidden patterns

    Write Contract Rules:
    1. No New Files - HOLD unless in sandbox (.arifos_clip/, scratch/)
    2. Canon Lock - VOID for creates in 000_THEORY/
    3. Patch Only - HOLD if no diff provided
    4. Rewrite Threshold - HOLD if deletion_ratio > 30%
    5. Read Before Write - HOLD if no read_proof (sha256 + bytes)
    6. Delete Gate - HOLD for any delete operation

    Args:
        request: FAGWriteRequest with path, operation, and validation data

    Returns:
        FAGWriteResponse with verdict and approval requirement
