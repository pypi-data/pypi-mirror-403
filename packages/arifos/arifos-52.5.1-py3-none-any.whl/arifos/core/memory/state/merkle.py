# arifos.core/state/merkle.py
"""
Merkle tree utilities for Cooling Ledger / zkPC (v36Ω).

- Uses SHA-256 hex hashes for leaves and internal nodes.
- Works with the `sha256_hex` helper from ledger_hashing.py.
- Designed for:
    - computing a Merkle root over ledger entries,
    - generating membership proofs,
    - verifying proofs.

This is v0.1 (non-zk). It is Merkle/zkPC-ready for future zk integration.

Moved to arifos.core.state as part of v47 Equilibrium Architecture.
