eureka_router.py — Phase 1 EUREKA Memory Router (v38.3Omega)

Routes memory write requests to appropriate bands based on:
- Verdict type
- Actor role
- Human seal status

Delegates authority checks to existing MemoryAuthorityCheck.

def route_write(req: MemoryWriteRequest) -> MemoryWriteDecision:
    """
    Route a memory write request to the appropriate band.
    
    Core routing logic:
    - TOOL → DROP (Amanah: no untrusted writes)
    - VOID verdict → VOID band
    - SABAR/SABAR_EXTENDED/HOLD_888 → PENDING band
    - PARTIAL → PHOENIX band
    - SEAL + human_seal + HUMAN → VAULT band (canonical)
    - SEAL (other cases) → LEDGER band (SEAL-ready, not canon)

        req: Memory write request
        
    Returns:
