router.py - The Sovereign Intelligence Router (v46 Kernel)

PHILOSOPHY:
    "The Router is the Switchboard. It directs Intent to the appropriate Intelligence
     based on Thermodynamic Constraints (Privacy, Entropy, Latency)."

    It serves as the 'Air Gap' between the User's Intent and the Model's Execution.
