"""
rif_bridge.py - Optional bridge for @RIF (epistemic rigor)

This module provides a thin, optional integration layer between the
@RIF organ and external reasoning / evaluation libraries (for example,
Ragas for answer quality or DSPy-style chains for reasoning traces).

Design goals:
- Optional: If external libs are not installed, the bridge returns None.
- Sovereign: The bridge NEVER decides verdicts; it only returns metrics.
- Stable: Any import / runtime failure is caught and surfaced as None.

Interface:

    bridge = RifBridge()
    result = bridge.analyze(output_text, context)

    result is either:
        None -> bridge unavailable or disabled
        RifBridgeResult -> {
            "delta_s_delta": float,  # additive adjustment to ΔS
            "truth_delta": float,    # additive adjustment to Truth
            "issues": List[str],     # textual notes for logging
        }

The @RIF organ remains free to ignore or reinterpret these signals
under arifOS floors (ΔS, Truth) and its own heuristics.
