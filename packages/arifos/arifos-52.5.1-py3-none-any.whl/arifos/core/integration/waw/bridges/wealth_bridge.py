"""
wealth_bridge.py - Optional bridge for @WEALTH (resource stewardship)

This module provides a thin, optional integration layer between the
@WEALTH organ and external safety / policy libraries (for example,
Llama Guard for harmful instruction detection).

Design goals:
- Optional: If external libs are not installed, the bridge returns None.
- Sovereign: The bridge NEVER decides verdicts; it only returns metrics.
- Stable: Any import / runtime failure is caught and surfaced as None.

Interface:

    bridge = WealthBridge()
    result = bridge.analyze(output_text, context)

    result is either:
        None -> bridge unavailable or disabled
        WealthBridgeResult -> {
            "amanah_breach": bool,  # external signal that trust is broken
            "issues": List[str],    # textual notes for logging
        }

The @WEALTH organ remains free to ignore or reinterpret these signals
under Amanah law and scope/reversibility rules.
