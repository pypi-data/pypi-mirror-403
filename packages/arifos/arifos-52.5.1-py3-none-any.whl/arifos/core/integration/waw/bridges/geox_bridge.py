"""
geox_bridge.py - Optional bridge for @GEOX (physical feasibility)

This module provides a thin, optional integration layer between the
@GEOX organ and external "reality check" libraries (e.g. retrieval /
RAG frameworks such as LlamaIndex, or custom physics checkers).

Design goals:
- Optional: If external libs are not installed, the bridge returns None.
- Sovereign: The bridge NEVER decides verdicts; it only returns metrics.
- Stable: Any import / runtime failure is caught and surfaced as None.

Interface:

    bridge = GeoxBridge()
    result = bridge.analyze(output_text, context)

    result is either:
        None  -> bridge unavailable or disabled
        GeoxBridgeResult  -> {
            "e_earth_delta": float,  # additive adjustment to E_earth
            "issues": List[str],     # textual notes for logging
        }

The @GEOX organ remains free to ignore or reinterpret these signals
under arifOS law; it continues to run its own pattern checks and
derive E_earth even when the bridge is present.
