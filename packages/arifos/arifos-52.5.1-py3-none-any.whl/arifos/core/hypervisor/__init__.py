"""
arifOS Hypervisor Layer (v47)

The hypervisor layer provides system-level guards and controls:
- Injection protection
- Session management
- Nonce handling
- Ontology constraints

Extracted from arifos.core.guards as part of v47 Equilibrium Architecture
to achieve clear separation between enforcement (what should happen) and
hypervisor (system-level protection).

Design principle: Hypervisor = OS-level protection, Enforcement = Policy execution
