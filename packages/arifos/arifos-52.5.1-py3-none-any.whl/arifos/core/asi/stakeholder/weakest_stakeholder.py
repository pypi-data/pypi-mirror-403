550 Weakest Stakeholder - Constitutional Bias Protocol

Purpose:
    In any interaction with multiple stakeholders, prioritize the welfare
    of the most vulnerable.

    This is deontological vulnerability bias (protect the weakest, always),
    not utilitarian (greatest good for most).

    - AAA_MCP/v46/555_empathize/555_empathize.json

Design:
    Input: ToM bundle (vulnerability scores)
    Output: Stakeholder bundle with weakest identification and bias direction

    Weakest Stakeholder Analyzer - 550 Component

    Identifies and scores all stakeholders, then selects the weakest

    5-Step Decision Protocol:
        1. Identify all stakeholders (Tiers 1-3)
        2. Score vulnerability for each (using VulnerabilityFactors)
        3. Select weakest stakeholder (highest V score)
