"""
arifOS Dream Forge: O-FORGE Anvil

Module: arifos.core.dream_forge.anvil
Version: v36.2 PHOENIX
Purpose: Generative Replay. Synthesizes variations of scars to inoculate the system.
Safety: Outputs are quarantined. This is a LAB tool.

O-TASK Steps:
    - O-FORGE: Generate nightmare variations from aligned ore
    - O-STRIKE: Test variations against governance pipeline
    - O-QUENCH: (Future) Commit successful patterns to canon

Motto: "Forge in fire, test in shadow, seal in ice."

Usage:
    from arifos.core.system.dream_forge.anvil import OForgeAnvil

    anvil = OForgeAnvil(llm_engine=my_llm)
    variations = anvil.forge_variations(aligned_ore, n=3)
    results = anvil.strike_validation(variations, governance_pipeline)

    O-FORGE Anvil: Generative Replay Engine.

    The Anvil takes aligned ore (classified scars) and generates
    adversarial variations to test the governance system's resilience.

    This implements the "Generative Replay" concept from thermodynamic
    intelligence: learning through controlled exposure to nightmares.
