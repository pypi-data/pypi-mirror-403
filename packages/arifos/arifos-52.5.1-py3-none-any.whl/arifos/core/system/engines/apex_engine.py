"""
apex_engine.py - APEX PRIME (Psi Engine) Facade

APEX PRIME is the Judiciary engine of the AGI·ASI·APEX Trinity.
Role: Judgment, veto, seal - constitutional floor enforcement

Pipeline stage owned:
- 888 JUDGE - Evaluate floors, issue verdict
- 999 SEAL - Final release (controlled by APEX verdict)

Constraints (from canon):
- Non-generative: does not produce content, only judges
- Refusal-first: prefers VOID/SABAR over speculative sealing
- Enforces all 9 constitutional floors (F1-F9)
- Integrates with @EYE Sentinel for blocking issues

This is a thin wrapper around existing APEX_PRIME.py.
See: canon/888_APEX_PRIME_CANON_v35Omega.md
