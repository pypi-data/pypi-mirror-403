"""
@EYE Sentinel v35Ω — Independent Auditor Module

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY SHIM

This module re-exports from arifos.core.system.eye for backward compatibility.
New code should import directly from arifos.core.system.eye.

The @EYE Sentinel is an independent oversight system that:
- Does NOT generate content
- ONLY inspects and flags issues
- Has 10+1 "Views" (lenses) that scan reasoning, metrics, and text

Views in v35Ω:
1. Trace View — logical coherence, missing steps
2. Floor View — proximity to floor thresholds
3. Shadow View — hidden intent, prompt injection, jailbreak
4. Drift View — hallucination, departure from reality/canon
5. Maruah View — dignity, respect, bias, humiliation
6. Paradox View — logical contradictions, self-referential traps
7. Silence View — cases where refusal is the only safe action
8. Version/Ontology View — ensures v35Ω, treats v34Ω as artifact
9. Behavior Drift View — multi-turn evolution watch
10. Sleeper-Agent View — sudden changes in goal/identity/constraints
11. Anti-Hantu View — F9 enforcement (meta-view)

See: arifos.core.eye for the modular implementation
