"""
ASI (Ω) - ASI (Auditor) Accountant

The second layer of the AGI·ASI·APEX Trinity (Δ → Ω → Ψ).

Role: Warm logic - metrics computation, uncertainty calibration, empathy
Physics: Entropy calculator

Symbol: Ω (Omega)
Name: ASI (Auditor)
Pipeline Position: Second gate - measure/calibrate before judgment

v41.3 Semantic Governance Layer 2:
- Computes the 9 constitutional floor metrics
- Calibrates uncertainty (Ω₀)
- Measures clarity gain (ΔS)
