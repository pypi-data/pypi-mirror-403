"""
stages/ — arifOS v38 Pipeline Stage Modules

This package contains modular implementations of pipeline stages.
Each stage is a distinct module with:
- compute_*() function for measurable signal extraction
- stage_*() function for state transformation

Stages:
- stage_000_amanah: Risk gate + Amanah lock (F1)
- stage_555_empathy: Empathy measurement (F6 kappa_r)
