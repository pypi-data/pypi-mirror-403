# Product Guide: CAPL Analyzer

## 1. Initial Concept

The CAPL Analyzer is designed to enhance the quality and reliability of CAPL (CANoe/CANalyzer Programming Language) projects through automated static analysis, linting, and code correction.

## 2. Primary Goal

The primary goal of the CAPL Analyzer is **Comprehensive CAPL Code Quality Assurance**.

This encompasses providing a complete code quality solution for CAPL projects, which includes:
*   **Static Analysis & Linting:** Detecting errors, warnings, and style violations before compilation.
*   **Automated Code Fixing:** Resolving common issues automatically, such as `extern` keyword removal, correct variable placement, and enforcing explicit type keywords for enums and structs.
*   **Opinionated Code Formatting:** Ensuring consistent code style through AST-aware formatting, including intelligent comment handling, context-aware vertical spacing (Setup vs. Logic zones), and robust indentation.
