![Package Overview](./docs/package_desc.png)

## 🚀 Features

- **Code Formatting**: Professional AST-based formatting (Ruff/Black style) for CAPL files.
- **Auto-Fix System**: Automatically resolves common linting issues with rule-specific fix logic.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Track `#include` relationships and build transitive visibility graphs.
- **Symbol Extraction**: Extract functions, parameters, event handlers, and enum members.
- **Cross-Reference System**: Find all references to any symbol across your codebase.
- **Static Analysis / Linter**: Detect common issues and enforce coding standards across multiple files.
- **Configuration Support**: Customize behavior via `.capl-lint.toml`.

## 💅 Formatting

The `drift format` command provides highly stable, idempotent formatting for CAPL, inspired by modern tools like Ruff and Black.

### Core Features

- **AST-Based Precision**: Uses `tree-sitter-c` to understand code structure, ensuring formatting never breaks logic.
- **Context-Aware Vertical Spacing**: 
    - **Setup Zone**: Automatically compresses local variable declarations at the start of blocks for a clean "header" look.
    - **Logic Zone**: Preserves developer-intended blank lines between functional statements.
    - **Boundary Cleanup**: Removes redundant blank lines at the start and end of blocks.
- **Top-Level Reordering** (Optional): Enforces a standardized architectural hierarchy:
    1. `includes` blocks.
    2. `variables` blocks (Global scope).
    3. `testcase` definitions (preserving relative order).
    4. Event handlers (`on message`, `on start`, etc.) sorted alphabetically.
    5. User functions sorted alphabetically.
- **Modern Standards**: Enforces K&R brace style, intelligent operator spacing, and consistent quote usage.

### Usage

```bash
# Format specific files or directories in-place
uv run drift format MyNode.can src/

# Check for violations without modifying (CI mode)
uv run drift format --check .

# Output results in JSON format
uv run drift format --json .
```

### Configuration

Customize the formatter via `.capl-format.toml`:

```toml
[tool.capl-format]
indent-size = 2
line-length = 100
brace-style = "k&r"
quote-style = "double"
reorder-top-level = true  # Standardize architectural order
```

## 📋 What Can It Detect?

### Errors
- ❌ Variables declared outside `variables {}` block
- ❌ Local variables declared after executable statements (mid-block)
- ❌ Undefined symbol references (with transitive include support and CAPL built-ins)
- ❌ Duplicate function definitions (across project)
- ❌ Circular include dependencies
- ❌ Missing `enum` or `struct` keywords in declarations
- ❌ Forbidden syntax: function forward declarations
- ❌ Forbidden syntax: `extern` keyword usage
- ❌ Forbidden syntax: arrow operator `->` (must use dot `.`)
- ❌ Forbidden syntax: struct pointers in parameters

### Warnings
- ⚠️ Unused variables, functions, messages, and timers
- ⚠️ Timers set without handlers

### Style Issues
- 💅 Naming conventions (global variables should start with `g`, messages with `msg`, timers with `t`)
- 💅 Code organization and structure

## 🔧 Installation

### Using UV (Recommended)

This project is managed as a [uv workspace](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/workspaces/).

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/capl-analyzer.git
cd capl-analyzer

# Sync the workspace (creates venv and installs all packages)
uv sync

# Run the linter
uv run drift lint MyNode.can
```

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The project is organized into a modular monorepo structure:

- **`drift`** (Root): User-facing CLI built with `typer`.
- **`packages/capl-tree-sitter`**: Core CAPL parsing using tree-sitter.
- **`packages/capl-symbol-db`**: Symbol extraction and persistent storage (SQLite).
- **`packages/capl-linter-engine`**: Analysis engine and auto-fix logic.
- **`packages/capl-formatter`**: AST-based code formatter.
