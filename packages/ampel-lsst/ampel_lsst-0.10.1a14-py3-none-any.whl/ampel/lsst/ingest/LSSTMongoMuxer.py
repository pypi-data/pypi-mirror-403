class LSSTMongoMuxer(AbsT0Muxer):
    """
    This class compares info between alert and DB so that only the needed info is ingested later.

    # Not used - removed
    :param alert_history_length: alerts must not contain all available info for a given transient.
    Alerts for LSST should provide a photometric history of 365 days.

    JN: For *elasticc* diffimage and forced photometry will have identical flux
    values. Since there is both a previous source phot and previous forced phot
    history, a single alert can contain multiple copes of the same measurement.
    Again, for *elasticc* it also seems like they keep the same id
    ForcedSourceID and SourceID
    for both kinds. As JN understand, this means that as new measurements come
    in, the typical SourceId flux values will be retained and forced phot
    "updates" not added to the DB. As the flux is the same this _should_ not
    matter.
    What we should do is probably:
    - Generate ID datapoints in LSSTDataPointShaper, prob of a hash from
    [time, flux, ccdVisitId(?)].
    - Make a proper superseeded search a la ZiMongoMuxer here where we would
    look for identical time (only?)
    But since this should not make a difference, provided we drop duplicates in
    the LSSTDataPointShaper it seems that this change is not strictly necessary
    now (assuming I got everything right.)
