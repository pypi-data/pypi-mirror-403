> AA Campaign requires a working installation of **Alliance Auth** and **django-eveuniverse**. Ensure these are set up before proceeding with the installation.

# AA Campaign
AA Campaign is a plugin for **Alliance Auth** that allows you to create and track ZKill campaigns. Whether you're monitoring a specific system, a whole region, or targeting a rival alliance, AA Campaign pulls data directly from ZKillboard to provide real-time intelligence and performance tracking.

> [!TIP]
> You can manually trigger a data pull using:
> ```bash
> python manage.py aa_campaign_pull --days 30
> ````
>
> adding `--verbose` to the end will display the raw data pulled from ZKillboard.
>
> You can repair killmails using:
> ```bash
> python manage.py aa_campaign_pull --repair
> ```

> [!WARNING]
> Running a long pull, or setting a campaign set far into the past can take an extremely long time.
> This app is designed with politeness towards API first and foremost. The more data you pull, the longer it will take.
