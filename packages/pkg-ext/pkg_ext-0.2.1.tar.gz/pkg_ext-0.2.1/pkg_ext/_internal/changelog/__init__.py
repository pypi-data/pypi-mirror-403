# Changelog management domain
#
# Note: parser.py and write_changelog_md.py are intentionally NOT imported here
# to avoid circular imports. They depend on pkg_ext.context and pkg_ext.pkg_state
# which in turn import from this package. Import them directly when needed:
#   from pkg_ext._internal.changelog.parser import parse_changelog
#   from pkg_ext._internal.changelog.write_changelog_md import write_changelog_md
