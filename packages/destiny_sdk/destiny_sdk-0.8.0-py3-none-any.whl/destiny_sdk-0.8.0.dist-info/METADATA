# DESTINY SDK

SDK for interaction with the DESTINY repository. For now this just contains data models for validation and structuring, but will be built out to include convenience functions etc.

## Documentation

The documentation for destiny-sdk is hosted [here](https://destiny-evidence.github.io/destiny-repository/sdk/sdk.html)

## Installation from PyPI

```sh
pip install destiny-sdk
```

```sh
uv add destiny-sdk
```

Some labs functionality may require extra dependencies - these can be installed by:

```sh
pip install destiny-sdk[labs]
uv add destiny-sdk --extra labs
```

## Development

### Dependencies

```sh
uv install
```

### Tests

```sh
uv run pytest
```

### Installing as an editable package of another project

Run the following command in the root folder of the other project (assuming uv as a packaging framework). Pip also has an `--editable` option that you can use.

```sh
uv add --editable ./PATH/TO/sdk/
```

or replace the dependency in `pyproject.toml` with

```toml
destiny-sdk = {path = "./PATH/TO/sdk/", develop = true}
```

### Installing a local wheel

If you want to use a local build of the sdk `z.whl`, do

```sh
uv build
uv add ./PATH/TO/WHEEL.whl
```

### Publishing

Once the package change is merged to main with an iterated `libs/sdk/pyproject.toml` version number, you can run the [github action](https://github.com/destiny-evidence/destiny-repository/actions/workflows/release-sdk-to-pypi.yml) to publish to the test pypi and then production pypi registries.

### Versioning

Follow the [semver](https://semver.org/) guidelines for versioning, tldr;

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

- `MAJOR` version when you make incompatible API change
- `MINOR` version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- `PATCH` version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
