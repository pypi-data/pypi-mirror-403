# spacekernel

SpaceKernel (Space Mission Engineering Tools) is a Python package providing a robust and extensible ecosystem for Earth satellite services, mission analysis, and space situational awareness (SSA).
It offers fast orbit propagation, maneuver simulation, coverage analysis, and powerful 2D/3D visualization, all designed for research and operational workflows.

## Features

- *Accurate Orbit Propagation:* Support for multiple integration methods and perturbation models, including J2, atmospheric drag, lunisolar, and SRP effects.

- *Maneuver Modeling:* Apply and analyze maneuvers with custom parameters and easy scenario setup.

- *Payload Coverage & Access:* Tools for computing payload coverage, contact windows, and access analysis.

- *Visualization:* High-quality 2D and 3D visualization for orbits, ground tracks, stations, and coverage footprints.

- *High Performance:* Cython-powered for speed.
