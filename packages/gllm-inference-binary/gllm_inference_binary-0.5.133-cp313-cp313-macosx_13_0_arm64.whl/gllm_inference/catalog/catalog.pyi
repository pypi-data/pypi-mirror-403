        ```python

        # Example 4: Load from records

            {"name": "...", "col_1": "...", "col_2": "..."},

        This class method reads component data from a Google Sheets worksheet and initializes components

                `private_key` are extracted from this file, effectively ignoring the `client_email` and `private_key`
                arguments. Defaults to None.
            client_email (str): The client email associated with the service account. This is ignored if
                `credential_file_path` is provided. Defaults to None.
            private_key (str): The private key used for authentication. This is ignored if `credential_file_path`
                is provided. Defaults to None.

        Returns:
            BaseCatalog[T]: An instance of `BaseCatalog[T]` initialized with components based on the
                Google Sheets data.
