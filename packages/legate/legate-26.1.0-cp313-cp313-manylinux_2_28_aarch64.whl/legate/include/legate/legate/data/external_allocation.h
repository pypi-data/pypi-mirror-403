/**
 * @brief Descriptor for external allocations
 *
 * An `ExternalAllocation` is a handle to a memory allocation outside Legate's memory management.
 * `ExternalAllocation` objects are used when users want to create Legate stores from existing
 * allocations external to Legate. (See two overloads of `Runtime::create_store()` that
 * take `ExternalAllocation`s.)
 *
 * `ExternalAllocation`s can be tagged either read-only or mutable.
 *
 * - If the allocation is read-only, the calling code must not mutate the contents of the allocation
 *   until it is detached. Doing so will result in undefined behavior. Legate will not make any
 *   updates of its own to a read-only allocation.
 * - If the allocation is mutable, Legate guarantees that any updates to the store to which the
 *   allocation is attached are eagerly written-through to the attached allocation, at the expense
 *   of block-waiting on tasks updating the store. The calling code is free to make updates to the
 *   allocation in-between tasks.
 *
 * The client code that creates an external allocation and attaches it to a Legate store must
 * guarantee that the allocation stays alive until all the tasks accessing the store are finished.
 * An external allocation attached to a store can be safely deallocated in two ways:
 *
 * 1) The client code calls the `detach()` method on the store before it deallocates the
 *    allocation. The `detach()` call makes sure that all outstanding operations on the store
 *    complete (see `LogicalStore::detach()`).
 * 2) The client code can optionally pass in a deleter for the allocation, which will be
 *    invoked once the store is destroyed and the allocation is no longer in use.
 *
 * Deleters don't need to be idempotent; Legate makes sure that they will be invoked only once
 * on the allocations. Deleters must not throw exceptions (throwable deleters are disallowed by
 * the type system). Deleters need not handle null pointers correctly, as external allocations
 * are not allowed to be created on null pointers. Each deleter is responsible for deallocating
 * only the allocation it is associated with and no other allocations.
