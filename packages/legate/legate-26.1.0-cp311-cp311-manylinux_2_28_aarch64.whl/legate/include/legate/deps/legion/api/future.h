  /**
   * \class Future
   * Futures are the objects returned from asynchronous task
   * launches.  Applications can wait on futures to get their values,
   * pass futures as arguments and preconditions to other tasks,
   * or use them to create predicates if they are boolean futures.
   * Futures are lightweight handles that can be passed by value
   * or stored in data structures.  However, futures should not
   * escape the context in which they are created as the runtime
   * garbage collects them after the enclosing task context
   * completes execution.
   *
   * Since futures can be the result of predicated tasks we also
   * provide a mechanism for checking whether the future contains
   * an empty result.  An empty future will be returned for all
   * futures which come from tasks which predicates that resolve
   * to false.
