  /**
   * \class Lock
   * NOTE THIS IS NOT A NORMAL LOCK!
   * A lock is an atomicity mechanism for use with regions acquired
   * with simultaneous coherence in a deferred execution model.
   * Locks are light-weight handles that are created in a parent
   * task and can be passed to child tasks to guaranteeing atomic access
   * to a region in simultaneous mode.  Lock can be used to request
   * access in either exclusive (mode 0) or non-exclusive mode (any number
   * other than zero).  Non-exclusive modes are mutually-exclusive from each
   * other. While locks can be passed down the task tree, they should
   * never escape the context in which they are created as they will be
   * garbage collected when the task in which they were created is complete.
   *
   * There are two ways to use locks.  The first is to use the blocking
   * acquire and release methods on the lock directly.  Acquire
   * guarantees that the application will hold the lock when it
   * returns, but may result in stalls while some other task is holding the
   * lock.  The recommended way of using locks is to request
   * grants of a lock through the runtime interface and then pass
   * grants to launcher objects.  This ensures that the lock will be
   * held during the course of the operation while still avoiding
   * any stalls in the task's execution.

   * \class PhaseBarrier
   * Phase barriers are a synchronization mechanism for use with
   * regions acquired with simultaneous coherence in a deferred
   * execution model.  Phase barriers allow the application to
   * guarantee that a collection of tasks are all executing their
   * sub-tasks all within the same phase of computation.  Phase
   * barriers are light-weight handles that can be passed by value
   * or stored in data structures.  Phase barriers are made in
   * a parent task and can be passed down to any sub-tasks.  However,
   * phase barriers should not escape the context in which they
   * were created as the task that created them will garbage collect
   * their resources.
   *
   * Note that there are two ways to use phase barriers.  The first
   * is to use the blocking operations to wait for a phase to begin
   * and to indicate that the task has arrived at the current phase.
   * These operations may stall and block current task execution.
   * The preferred method for using phase barriers is to pass them
   * in as wait and arrive barriers for launcher objects which will
   * perform the necessary operations on barriers before an after
   * the operation is executed.
