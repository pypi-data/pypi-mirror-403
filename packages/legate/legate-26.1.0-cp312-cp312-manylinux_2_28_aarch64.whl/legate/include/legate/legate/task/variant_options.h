   * @brief Whether the variant needs a concurrent task launch. `false` by default.
   *
   * Normally, leaf tasks (i.e. all individual task instances created by a single launch) are
   * allowed to execute in any order so long as their preconditions are met. For example, if a
   * task is launched that creates 100 leaf tasks, those tasks can execute at any time so long
   * as each individual task's inputs are satisfied. It is even possible to have other leaf
   * tasks (from other tasks) executing at the same time or between them.
   *
   * Setting `concurrent` to `true` says: if this task is parallelized, then all leaf tasks
   * must execute concurrently. Note, concurrency is a *requirement*, not a grant. The entire
   * machine must execute the tasks at exactly the same time as one giant block. No other tasks
   * marked concurrent may execute at the same time.
   *
   * Setting `concurrent` to `false` (the default) says: the task can execute as normal. The
   * leaf tasks can execute in any order.
   *
   * This feature is most often used when doing collective communications (i.e. all-reduce,
   * all-gather) inside the tasks. In this case, the tasks need to execute in lockstep because
   * otherwise deadlocks may occur.
   *
   * Suppose there are 2 tasks (A and B) that do collectives. If they execute without
   * concurrency, it is possible for half of the "task A" tasks and half of the "task B" tasks
   * to be running at the same time. Eventually each of those tasks will reach a point where
   * they must all-gather. The program would deadlock because both sides would be waiting for
   * the communication that would never be able to finish.
   *
   * For this reason, adding any communicators (see `communicators`) automatically implies
   * `concurrent = true`.

  /**
   * @brief Whether this variant can skip full device context synchronization after completion,
   * or whether it can synchronize only on the task stream.
   *
   * The user should typically set `elide_device_ctx_sync = true` for better performance,
   * unless their task performs GPU work outside of its assigned stream. It is, in effect, a
   * promise that the user task does not perform work on a stream other than the task's
   * stream. Or, if the task does do work on external streams, that those streams are
   * synchronized (possibly asynchronously) against the task stream before leaving the task
   * body.
   *
   * The default is currently `false` for backwards compatibility, but it may default to `true`
   * in the future.
   *
   * When `elide_device_ctx_sync = false`:
   * - The runtime will call the equivalent of `cuCtxSynchronize()` at the end of each GPU
   *   task.
   * - This acts as a full device-wide barrier, ensuring any outstanding GPU work has
   *   completed.
   *
   * When `elide_device_ctx_sync = true`:
   * - The runtime may assume all GPU work was issued on the task's stream.
   * - Instead of a full synchronization, the runtime may insert stream dependencies for
   *   downstream tasks specific to each point, so any dependent work need only wait on the
   *   exact leaf task instance that produced it.
   * - This avoids expensive context-wide synchronization, improving efficiency.
   *
   * @note The synchronization schemes described here have no effect on
   * `Runtime::issue_execution_fence()`. Execution fences wait until all prior tasks are
   * "complete", and since GPU work is treated as part of a task's execution, a task is not
   * considered "complete" until its stream is idle. As a result, an execution fence after a
   * GPU task *always* has the same behavior, regardless of the synchronization scheme
   * used. Either the runtime waits for the device-wide sync to finish, or it waits until all
   * leaf-task streams are idle.
   *
   * Has no effect on non-device variants (for example CPU variants).

   * When a task only takes scalar stores, it gets replicated by default on all the ranks, as
   * that's more efficient than having only one of the ranks run it and broadcast the results.
   *
   * However, sometimes a task may have "side effects" (which are outside the runtime's
   * tracking) which should otherwise forbid the runtime from replicating a particular variant.
   *
   * For example, the task may write something to disk, or effect some other kind of permanent
   * change to the system. In these cases the runtime must not replicate the task, as the

   *
   * @warning This special handling usually comes with severe performance penalties. For
   * example, the runtime may block the calling thread (i.e. the main thread) on the completion
   * of the possibly throwing task, or may opt not to schedule any other tasks concurrently.
