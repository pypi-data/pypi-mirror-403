/**
 * @defgroup accessor Accessor types
 *
 * Accessors provide an interface to access values in stores. Access modes are encoded
 * in the accessor types so that the compiler can catch invalid accesses. Accessors also
 * provide bounds checks (which can be turned on with a compile flag).
 *
 * All accessors have a `ptr` method that returns a raw pointer to the underlying allocation.
 * The caller can optionally pass an array to query strides of dimensions, necessary for correct
 * accesse. Unlike the accesses mediated by accessors, raw pointer accesses are not protected by
 * Legate, and thus the developer should make sure of safety of the accesses.
 *
 * The most common mistake with raw pointers from reduction accessors are that the code overwrites
 * values to the elements, instead of reducing them. The key contract with reduction is that
 * the values must be reduced to the elements in the store. So, any client code that uses a raw
 * pointer to a reduction store should make sure that it makes updates to the effect of reducing
 * its contributions to the original elements. Not abiding by this contract can lead to
 * non-deterministic conrrectness issues.
