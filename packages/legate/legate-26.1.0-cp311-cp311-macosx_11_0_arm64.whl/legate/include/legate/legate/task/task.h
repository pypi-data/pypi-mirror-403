/**
 * @brief A base class template for Legate task implementations.
 *
 * Any Legate task class must inherit legate::LegateTask directly or transitively. The type
 * parameter `T` needs to be bound to a child Legate task class that inherits legate::LegateTask.
 *
 * Currently, each task can have up to three variants. Each variant must be static member
 * functions of the class under the following names and signatures:
 *
 * - `void cpu_variant(legate::TaskContext)`: CPU implementation of the task
 * - `void gpu_variant(legate::TaskContext)`: GPU implementation of the task
 * - `void omp_variant(legate::TaskContext)`: OpenMP implementation of the task
 *
 * Tasks must have at least one variant, and all task variants must be semantically equivalent
 * (modulo some minor rounding errors due to floating point imprecision).
 *
 * Each task class must also have a type alias `Registrar` that points to a library specific
 * registrar class. (See legate::TaskRegistrar for details.)
 *
 * Tasks may also declare the following static members, which are used to populate defaults and
 * other information in various circumstances. These are split into 2 categories, task-wide and
 * per-variant. Task-wide members are usually used to describe invariants across the entire
 * task, or, to provide default values across all task variants. Per-variant members on the
 * other hand apply only to the specified variant, and override any task-wide settings where
 * applicable.
 *
 * Task-wide static members:
 *
 * - `static const legate::TaskConfig TASK_CONFIG`: This specifies the task-wide configuration,
 *   such as the task ID, the task signature, and default variant options to be used.
 *
 * Per-variant static members:
 *
 * - `static constexpr VariantOptions CPU_VARIANT_OPTIONS`: Specifies the default variant
 *   options used when registering the CPU variant of the task.
 * - `static constexpr VariantOptions OMP_VARIANT_OPTIONS`: Specifies the default variant
 *   options used when registering the OMP variant of the task.
 * - `static constexpr VariantOptions GPU_VARIANT_OPTIONS`: Specifies the default variant
 *   options used when registering the GPU variant of the task.
 *
 * If the default variant options are not present, the variant options for a given variant `v`
 * are selected in the following order:
 *
 * #. The variant options (if any) supplied at the call-site of `register_variants()`.
 * #. The default variant options (if any) found in `XXX_VARIANT_OPTIONS`.
 * #. (If defined) The default variant options found in `TASK_CONFIG` (if any).
 * #. The variant options provided by `Library::get_default_variant_options()`.
 * #. The global default variant options found in `VariantOptions::DEFAULT_OPTIONS`.
 *
 * @note Users are *highly* encouraged to use these static members to pre-declare their task
 * and variant properties. In all cases, the same information can be supplied dynamically at
 * either task registration, construction, or launch time, but doing so statically is preferred
 * as the runtime is able to make more efficient decisions when scheduling or launching the
 * tasks.
 *
