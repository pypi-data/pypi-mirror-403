/**
 * @brief A helper class that describes parallelization policies for tasks.
 *
 * A `ParallelPolicy` consists of knobs to control the parallelization policy for tasks in a given
 * scope. To change the parallelization policy of the scope, a new `Scope` must be created with a
 * `ParallelPolicy`. Currently, the `ParallelPolicy` class provides the following parameters:
 *
 *   - `streaming(StreamingMode)` (default: `OFF`): When the `streaming()` is not `OFF` in a scope,
 * the runtime executes the tasks in a streaming fashion. For example, if there are two tasks `T1`
 * and `T2` in the scope, the normal execution would run all parallel instances of `T1` before it
 * would move on to `T2`'s, whereas the streaming execution would alternative between `T1` and `T2`,
 *   launching a subset of parallel instances at a time that would fit to the memory. The
 *   granularity of tasks can be configured by the `overdecompose_factor()` (see below), and if the
 *   `overdecompose_factor()` is `1`, no streaming would happen even if the `streaming()` is `true`.
 *
 *   - `overdecompose_factor()` (default: `1`): When the value is greater than `1`, the
 *   auto-partitioner will over-decompose the stores when partitioning them; by default, the
 *   auto-partitioner creates `N` chunks in a store partition when there are `N` processors, but if
 *   the `overdecompose_factor()` is `k` in the scope, it would create `kN` chunks in the partition.
