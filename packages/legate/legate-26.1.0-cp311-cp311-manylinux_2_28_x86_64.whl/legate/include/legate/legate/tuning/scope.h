/**
 * @brief A helper class to configure task execution
 *
 * The Scope class offers APIs to configure runtime parameters for task execution. The parameters
 * set by a Scope object are effective only for the lifetime of the object. Currently, Scope can be
 * used to configure the following parameters:
 *
 * 1) Task priority: Each task is associated with a priority value. The higher the value, the
 * earlier among a set of ready-to-run tasks the task will get scheduled for execution. (the task
 * with a higher priority, however, does not preempt another with a lower priority that is already
 * running on the processor.) Task priorities are a signed 32-bit integer value. By default, all
 * tasks get assigned to 0 for the priorities.
 *
 * 2) Provenance: User programs or libraries often want to attach provenance information to each of
 * their operations and have it rendered in profiling outputs. Such information can be passed as a
 * string via a Scope object, which then will be attached to all operations issued within the
 * Scope's lifetime.
 *
 * 3) Machine: By default, Legate operations target the entire machine available for the program.
 * When a user program wants to assign a subset of the machine to its operations, it can subdivide
 * the machine using the machine API (see `Machine` for details) and set a sub-machine for the scope
 * using Scope. All operations within the lifetime of the Scope object can use only the sub-machine
 * for their execution.
 *
 * 4) Parallelization policies: Legate has default policies to parallelize tasks, which the user
 * program might want to override. In this case, the user program can set a new `ParallelPolicy`
 * object to the scope to install new parallelization policies (see `ParallelPolicy`).
 *
 * Each parameter can be set only once via each Scope object. Multiple attempts to set the same
 * parameter would raise an exception.
