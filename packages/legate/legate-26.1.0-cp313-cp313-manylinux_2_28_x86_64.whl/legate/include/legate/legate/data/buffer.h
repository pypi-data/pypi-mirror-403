/**
 * @brief A typed buffer class for intra-task temporary allocations
 *
 * Values in a buffer can be accessed by index expressions with \ref Point objects, or via a raw
 * pointer to the underlying allocation, which can be queried with the `Buffer::ptr()` method.
 *
 * \ref Buffer is an alias to
 * [Legion::DeferredBuffer](https://github.com/StanfordLegion/legion/blob/9ed6f4d6b579c4f17e0298462e89548a4f0ed6e5/runtime/legion.h#L3509-L3609).
 *
 * Note on using temporary buffers in CUDA tasks:
 *
 * We use `Legion::DeferredBuffer`, whose lifetime is not connected with the CUDA stream(s)
 * used to launch kernels. The buffer is allocated immediately at the point when
 * create_buffer() is called, whereas the kernel that uses it is placed on a stream, and may
 * run at a later point. Normally a `Legion::DeferredBuffer` is deallocated automatically by
 * Legion once all the kernels launched in the task are complete. However, a
 * `Legion::DeferredBuffer` can also be deallocated immediately using
 * `Legion::DeferredBuffer::destroy()`, which is useful for operations that want to deallocate
 * intermediate memory as soon as possible. This deallocation is not synchronized with the task
 * stream, i.e. it may happen before a kernel which uses the buffer has actually
 * completed. This is safe as long as we use the same stream on all GPU tasks running on the
 * same device (which is guaranteed by the current implementation of @ref
 * TaskContext::get_task_stream()), because then all the actual uses of the buffer are done in
 * order on the one stream. It is important that all library CUDA code uses @ref
 * TaskContext::get_task_stream(), and all CUDA operations (including library calls) are
 * enqueued on that stream exclusively. This analysis additionally assumes that no code outside
 * of Legate is concurrently allocating from the eager pool, and that it's OK for kernels to
 * access a buffer even after it's technically been deallocated.

/**
 * @brief A task-local temporary buffer.
 *
 * A `TaskLocalBuffer` is, as the name implies, "local" to a task. Its lifetime is bound to
 * that of the task. When the task ends, the buffer is destroyed. It is most commonly used as
 * temporary scratch-space within tasks for that reason.
 *
 * The buffer is allocated immediately at the point when `TaskLocalBuffer` is created, so it is
 * safe to use it immediately, even if it used asynchronously (for example, in GPU kernel
 * launches) after the fact.
