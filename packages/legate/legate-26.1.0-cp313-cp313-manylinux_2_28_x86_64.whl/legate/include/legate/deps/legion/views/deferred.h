     * \class DeferredView
     * A DeferredView class is an abstract class for representing
     * lazy computation in an equivalence set. At the moment, the
     * types only allow deferred views to capture other kinds of
     * lazy evaluation. In particular this is either a fill view
     * or nested levels of predicated fill views. It could also
     * support other kinds of lazy evaluation as well. Importantly,
     * since it only captures lazy computation and not materialized
     * data there are no InstanceView managers captured in its
     * representations, which is an important invariant for the
     * equivalence sets. Think long and hard about what you're
     * doing if you ever decide that you want to break that
     * invariant and capture the names of instance views inside
     * of a deferred view.
