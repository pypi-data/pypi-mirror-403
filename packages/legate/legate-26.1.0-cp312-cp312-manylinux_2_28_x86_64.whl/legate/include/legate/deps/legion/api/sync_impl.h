     * \class GrantImpl
     * This is the base implementation of a grant object.
     * The grant implementation remembers the locks that
     * must be acquired and gives out an precondition event
     * for acquiring the locks whenever a user attempts
     * to register as using the grant.  Registering requires
     * providing a completion event for the operation which
     * the grant object then knows to use when releasing the
     * locks.  Grants continues accepting registrations
     * until the runtime marks that it is no longer active.
