     * \class OccurrenceWatcher
     * The occurrence watcher class maintains a trie of hashes corresponding
     * to candidate traces. These are sequences of hashes that we've observed
     * some number of times. Once these sequences are observed a certain
     * number of times determined by visit_threshold then these candidates
     * are promoted up to the full traces in the trace cache and are
     * eligible for replay. Note that each new hash can be the start of a
     * new trace so we maintain a group of active_pointers corresponding to
     * traces that are still matching in the trie.
