# This file exists because we want to keep "from legate.task import foo"
# because the extra namespace helps to disambiguate things. I tried doing:
#
# from ._ext import task
#
# in legate/__init__.py but Python doesn't like that, and in fact, won't
# consider attributes as modules during module lookup:
#
# ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'legate.task'
#
# So the only solution is to keep a dummy "module" here, whose only job is to
# mirror the real module over in _ext/task.
