"""Base class for latency distributions.

LatencyDistribution provides an interface for sampling latency values
in simulation. Implementations can be constant (deterministic) or
follow statistical distributions (exponential, normal, etc.).

Latency distributions support arithmetic operators for adjusting
the mean, returning modified copies.
