    This action adds a specified item to the player's inventory by calling the

    in the inventory manager - this action only marks it as acquired.

    When the item is successfully acquired, an ItemAcquiredEvent is published
    (if the inventory manager has an event bus), which can trigger follow-up
    scripts or reactions.

    The action completes immediately after attempting to acquire the item. It
    returns True regardless of whether the item was newly acquired or already
    owned, so it can be used safely in scripts without worrying about double
    acquisition.
