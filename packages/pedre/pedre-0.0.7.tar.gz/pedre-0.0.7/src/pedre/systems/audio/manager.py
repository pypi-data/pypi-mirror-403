"""Audio system for music and sound effects.

This module provides the audio management system for the game, handling both
background music and sound effects with caching, volume control, and playback
state management.

Audio Organization:
    The audio system expects files to be organized in the assets/audio/ directory:

    assets/audio/
    ├── music/           # Background music tracks (looping)
    │   ├── background.ogg
    │   ├── beach.ogg
    │   └── turntable.mp3
    └── sfx/             # Sound effects (one-shot)
        ├── avi.mp3
        ├── martin.mp3
        └── feliz_cumple.mp3

Key Features:
    - Music caching for faster scene transitions
    - Sound effect caching for reduced loading times
    - Independent volume controls for music and SFX
    - Toggle support for muting music/SFX independently
    - Streaming support for non-looping music (reduces memory)
    - Background preloading with wait mechanism

Usage from Code:
    # Play background music
    audio_manager.play_music("background.ogg", loop=True, volume=0.7)

    # Play a sound effect
    audio_manager.play_sfx("avi.mp3")

    # Control volume
    audio_manager.set_music_volume(0.5)
    audio_manager.set_sfx_volume(0.8)

Usage from Scripts:
    [
        {"type": "play_music", "music": "beach.ogg", "loop": true},
        {"type": "play_sfx", "sfx": "feliz_cumple.mp3"}
    ]

Integration:
    - PlayMusicAction and PlaySFXAction in the scripting system
    - Called by game view for scene transitions and events
    - Responds to user settings for volume and enable/disable

    The AudioManager is the central system for all audio playback in the game.
    It provides:
    - Background music playback with looping and volume control
    - Sound effect playback for game events and interactions
    - Intelligent caching to reduce loading times and improve performance
    - Independent enable/disable and volume controls for music and SFX
    - Streaming support for large, non-looping audio files

    Performance Optimizations:
    - Music files are cached after first load for instant replay
    - Sound effects are cached on first use and reused
    - Non-looping music uses streaming to avoid memory overhead
    - Background preloading with synchronization support

    State Management:
    - Tracks currently playing music and its player
    - Maintains separate enabled states for music and SFX
    - Stores volume preferences independently for music and SFX
    - Manages cache lifecycle to balance memory and performance

    This system has no dependencies on other systems.
