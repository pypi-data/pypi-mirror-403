"""Dialog system for managing game dialogs and conversations.

This module provides the dialog display system used throughout the game for
NPC conversations, narration, and player communication. It handles dialog
pagination, visual presentation, and user interaction.

The dialog system is typically used through:
- Direct NPC interaction (player presses E near an NPC)
- Scripted sequences (actions triggered by game events)
- Tutorial and story moments

Dialog Configuration:
    Dialogs are typically loaded from JSON files in assets/dialogs/ directory.
    Each file follows the pattern <scene>_dialogs.json (e.g., casa_dialogs.json).

    JSON structure:
        {
            "npc_name": {
                "0": {
                    "name": "Display Name",
                    "text": [
                        "First page of dialog",
                        "Second page of dialog"
                    ]
                },
                "1": {
                    "name": "Display Name",
                    "text": ["Next dialog level"],
                    "conditions": [
                        {
                            "check": "inventory_accessed",
                            "equals": true
                        }
                    ],
                    "on_condition_fail": [
                        {
                            "type": "dialog",
                            "speaker": "Display Name",
                            "text": ["Alternative text if condition fails"]
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        }

    The "name" field is optional - if provided, it will be displayed as the speaker name
    in the dialog box instead of the NPC's key name (e.g., "Merchant" instead of "merchant").

Example usage from code:
    dialog_manager.show_dialog("Martin", [
        "Welcome to the game!",
        "Press E to interact with NPCs.",
        "Have fun exploring!"
    ])

class DialogPage:
    """Represents a single page of dialog.

    Dialog can span multiple pages, with each page shown sequentially as the
    player advances through them. This class holds the data for one page,
    including metadata for tracking position within the full conversation.

    NPCs can have multiple dialog levels (0, 1, 2, etc.) that progress as the
    story unfolds. Each dialog level can contain multiple pages. For example:
    - Level 0: Initial greeting (2 pages)
    - Level 1: After completing a task (1 page)
    - Level 2: Final conversation (3 pages)

    Attributes:
        npc_name: Display name of the character speaking.
        text: The dialog text to display on this page.
        page_num: Zero-based index of this page in the full dialog.
        total_pages: Total number of pages in this dialog sequence.

    Example:
        # Page 2 of a 3-page dialog from Martin
        page = DialogPage(
            npc_name="Martin",
            text="This is the second page of dialog.",

@SystemRegistry.register
class DialogManager(BaseSystem):
    """Manages dialog display and pagination.

    The DialogManager is the core system for displaying conversations in the game.
    It handles:
    - Converting multi-page text into individual dialog pages
    - Tracking the current page being displayed
    - Advancing through pages or closing the dialog
    - Rendering the dialog UI with a semi-transparent overlay and styled dialog box

    The manager maintains state about whether a dialog is currently showing and
    which page the player is viewing. Players advance through pages by pressing
    SPACE, and the dialog automatically closes after the last page.

    Visual Design:
    - Semi-transparent black overlay covers the game world
    - Dark blue-gray dialog box in the lower portion of the screen
    - Yellow NPC name at the top of the box
    - White dialog text with multiline support
    - Page indicator for multi-page dialogs
    - Context-sensitive instructions (next page vs close)

    Integration:
    - Called by the game view when players interact with NPCs
    - Used by DialogAction in the scripting system for cutscenes
    - Publishes DialogClosedEvent when dialogs are dismissed
    - Works with WaitForDialogCloseAction to pause scripts until player reads

    Scripted Dialog Example:
        # In a script, you can chain dialogs and actions:
        [
            {"type": "dialog", "speaker": "Martin", "text": ["Hello!"]},
            {"type": "wait_for_dialog_close"},  # Pauses until player presses SPACE
            {"type": "move_npc", "npcs": ["martin"], "waypoint": "door"},
            {"type": "wait_for_movement", "npc": "martin"},
            {"type": "dialog", "speaker": "Martin", "text": ["I'm leaving now!"]}
        ]
