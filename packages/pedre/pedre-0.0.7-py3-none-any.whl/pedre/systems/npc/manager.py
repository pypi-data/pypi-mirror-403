"""NPC management system for tracking state, movement, and interactions.

This module provides the NPCManager class, which serves as the central hub for all
NPC-related functionality in the game. It manages NPC registration, pathfinding-based
movement, dialog system with conditional branching, and animation state tracking.

The NPC system supports:
- Dynamic registration and tracking of multiple NPCs per scene
- Scene-aware dialog system with conversation progression
- Conditional dialog branching based on game state
- Pathfinding-based movement with automatic obstacle avoidance
- Animation state management (appear, disappear, walk cycles)
- Event emission for NPC lifecycle (movement complete, animations finished)
- Interaction distance checking for player-NPC communication

Key features:
- **Dialog System**: Multi-level conversations with conditional branching. NPCs can have
  different dialog at each conversation level, with conditions that check inventory state,
  interaction history, or other NPC dialog levels.
- **Movement**: NPCs navigate using A* pathfinding, automatically avoiding walls and other
  NPCs. Movement is smooth and frame-rate independent.
- **Animations**: Integration with AnimatedNPC sprites for appear/disappear effects and
  walking animations that sync with movement direction.
- **Scene Awareness**: Dialog can vary by scene/map, allowing NPCs to have location-specific
  conversations.

The manager uses an event-driven architecture where NPC actions (movement complete,
animations finished) publish events that scripts can listen for to create complex
scripted sequences.

Example usage:
    # Get the NPC manager from context
    npc_mgr = context.get_system("npc")

    # Load dialog from JSON files
    npc_mgr.load_dialogs_from_json("assets/dialogs/")

    # Register NPCs from map
    for npc_sprite in npc_layer:
        npc_mgr.register_npc(npc_sprite, name=npc_sprite.properties["name"])

    # Check for nearby NPC interaction
    nearby = npc_mgr.get_nearby_npc(player_sprite)
    if nearby:
        sprite, name, dialog_level = nearby
        dialog_config, _ = npc_mgr.get_dialog(name, dialog_level, current_scene)
        if dialog_config:
            show_dialog(name, dialog_config.text)

    # Move NPC to location
    npc_mgr.move_npc_to_tile("martin", tile_x=10, tile_y=15)

    # Update movement each frame
    npc_mgr.update(delta_time, context)

@dataclass
class NPCState:
    """Runtime state tracking for a single NPC.

    NPCState holds all mutable state for an NPC during gameplay, including their current
    position (via sprite), conversation progress, pathfinding data, and animation status.
    This state persists throughout the game session and is updated as the NPC moves,
    interacts with players, and performs animations.

    The state is stored separately from dialog configuration (NPCDialogConfig) to separate
    what the NPC says (static data) from what the NPC is currently doing (runtime state).

    Attributes:
        sprite: The arcade Sprite representing this NPC visually. Can be a regular Sprite
               or an AnimatedNPC with animation capabilities. Position is tracked via
               sprite.center_x and sprite.center_y.
        name: Unique identifier for this NPC (e.g., "martin", "shopkeeper"). Used for
             lookups, dialog assignment, and event tracking.
        dialog_level: Current conversation progression level (0-based). Increments as
                     player has conversations, determining which dialog text is shown.
                     Default starts at 0 for first conversation.
        path: Queue of (x, y) pixel coordinates representing the NPC's pathfinding route.
             Waypoints are popped from the front as the NPC reaches them. Empty deque
             means no active path.
        is_moving: Whether the NPC is currently traversing a path. True during movement,
                  False when stationary. NPCs cannot be interacted with while moving.
        appear_event_emitted: Tracks if NPCAppearCompleteEvent has been published for this
                            NPC. Reset when starting a new appear animation. Prevents
                            duplicate event emissions.
        disappear_event_emitted: Tracks if NPCDisappearCompleteEvent has been published.
                               Reset when starting a new disappear animation. Prevents
                               duplicate event emissions.

class NPCDialogConfig:
    """Configuration for NPC dialog at a specific conversation level.

    NPCDialogConfig defines what an NPC says at a particular point in their conversation
    progression, along with optional conditions that must be met for this dialog to appear.
    This is static data typically loaded from JSON files that doesn't change during gameplay.

    The dialog system supports conditional branching where different text can be shown based
    on game state (inventory accessed, objects interacted with, other NPC dialog levels).
    If conditions aren't met, optional fallback actions can be executed instead.

    Attributes:
        text: List of dialog text pages to display. Each string is one page that the player
             advances through. Example: ["Hello there!", "Welcome to my shop."]
        name: Optional display name for the speaker. If provided, this name is shown in the
             dialog box instead of the NPC's key name. Useful for proper capitalization or
             titles (e.g., "Merchant" instead of "merchant").
        conditions: Optional list of condition dictionaries that must ALL be true for this
                   dialog to display. Each condition has a "check" type and expected values.
                   Common checks: "npc_dialog_level", "inventory_accessed", "object_interacted".
                   If None or empty, dialog always shows.
        on_condition_fail: Optional list of action dictionaries to execute if conditions fail.
                          Allows fallback behavior like showing reminder text or triggering
                          alternative sequences. If None, condition failure silently falls back

    The NPCManager is the central controller for all NPC-related systems. It coordinates
    NPC registration, dialog management, pathfinding movement, animation tracking, and
    event emission for NPC lifecycle events.

    Key responsibilities:
    - **Registration**: Track all NPCs in the current scene by name
    - **Dialog**: Load and serve scene-aware dialog with conditional branching
    - **Movement**: Calculate and execute pathfinding-based movement
    - **Interaction**: Determine which NPCs are within interaction range
    - **Animation**: Track animation state for appear/disappear effects
    - **Events**: Publish events when NPCs complete movements or animations

    The manager uses a scene-based dialog system where conversations are organized by
    map/scene name, allowing NPCs to have different dialog depending on location. Dialog
    progression is tracked per-NPC via dialog_level, supporting multi-stage conversations.

    Movement is handled via A* pathfinding with smooth interpolation between waypoints.
    NPCs automatically avoid walls and other moving NPCs. Movement completes when the
    NPC reaches their final waypoint, triggering an event that scripts can respond to.

    Attributes:
        npcs: Dictionary mapping NPC names to their NPCState instances. Contains all
             registered NPCs and their current runtime state.
        dialogs: Nested dictionary structure: scene -> npc_name -> dialog_level -> config.
                Stores all loaded dialog configurations organized by scene and progression.
        pathfinding: PathfindingManager instance used for calculating NPC movement paths.
        interaction_distance: Maximum distance in pixels for player to interact with NPCs.
        waypoint_threshold: Distance in pixels to consider an NPC has reached a waypoint.
        npc_speed: Movement speed in pixels per second. Applied to all NPCs uniformly.
        inventory_manager: Optional reference for checking inventory conditions in dialog.
        event_bus: Optional EventBus for publishing NPC lifecycle events.
        interacted_objects: Set tracking which interactive objects have been used, for
                           dialog condition checking.
