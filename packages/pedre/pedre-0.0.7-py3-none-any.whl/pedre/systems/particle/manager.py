"""Particle effects system for visual polish.

This module provides a lightweight particle system for adding visual feedback and
atmosphere to the game. Particles are small, temporary visual effects that enhance
player interactions, NPC behaviors, and world events.

The particle system consists of:
- Particle: Individual particle data including position, velocity, and visual properties
- ParticleManager: System for creating, updating, and rendering particles

The manager provides several pre-configured particle effects:
- Hearts: Romantic/affection effects that float upward
- Sparkles: Quick bursts for interactions and discoveries
- Trail: Subtle movement trails for the player
- Burst: Dramatic explosions for reveals and events

Particles automatically fade out over their lifetime and are removed when expired.
The system uses simple physics including gravity simulation for realistic movement.

Example usage:
    # Create manager
    particle_manager = ParticleManager()

    # Emit effects
    particle_manager.emit_hearts(player_x, player_y)
    particle_manager.emit_sparkles(chest_x, chest_y, color=(255, 215, 0))

    # Update and render each frame
    particle_manager.update(delta_time)
    particle_manager.draw()

    # Toggle effects on/off
    particle_manager.toggle()

    The manager handles:
    - Creating particles with randomized properties for natural variation
    - Updating particle positions and ages each frame
    - Applying physics (velocity, gravity) to particles
    - Fading and removing expired particles
    - Rendering all active particles

    Particles can be toggled on/off globally for performance or player preference. When

    Each particle effect type (hearts, sparkles, trail, burst) has pre-tuned parameters
