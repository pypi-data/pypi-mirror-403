"""Inventory system for managing collectible items.

This module provides the InventoryManager class, which manages the player's collection
of items throughout the game. Items can represent various collectibles like photos,
notes, keys, or quest items that the player discovers and acquires during gameplay.

The inventory system supports:
- Defining items with metadata (name, description, image, category)
- Tracking which items the player has acquired
- Filtering items by category for organized display
- Persistence through save/load functionality
- Tracking first-time inventory access for tutorial/achievement systems
- Publishing events when items are acquired

Items are organized into categories to allow for different types of collectibles:
- "photo": Visual memories and photographs
- "note": Written documents, letters, clues
- "key": Items that unlock doors or areas
- "general": Miscellaneous items

The manager maintains a master list of all possible items, each with an 'acquired'
flag that tracks whether the player has collected it. This approach supports both
showing acquired items to the player and tracking completion progress.

Example usage:
    # Initialize manager with event bus
    inventory_mgr = InventoryManager(event_bus)

    # Add a custom item
    key_item = InventoryItem(
        id="secret_key",
        name="Rusty Key",
        description="A key that might open something...",
        image_path="items/rusty_key.png",
        icon_path="items/icons/key_icon.png",
        category="key"
    )
    inventory_mgr.add_item(key_item)

    # Acquire item when player finds it (publishes ItemAcquiredEvent)
    if inventory_mgr.acquire_item("secret_key"):
        show_notification("Found: Rusty Key")

    # Check if player has item (for puzzle logic)
    if inventory_mgr.has_item("secret_key"):
        unlock_door()

    # Display acquired photos in UI
    photos = inventory_mgr.get_acquired_items(category="photo")
    for photo in photos:
        display_photo(photo)

    # Save/load support
    save_data = inventory_mgr.to_dict()
    # ... later ...
    inventory_mgr.from_dict(save_data)

class InventoryItem:
    """Represents a collectible item in the player's inventory.

    An InventoryItem contains all the metadata needed to display and track a collectible
    item in the game. Items are defined with their content (name, description, image) and
    state (whether the player has acquired it).

    The dataclass structure makes items easy to define in code or load from data files.
    Items are typically created during game initialization and added to the InventoryManager,
    where they persist throughout the game session.

    The 'acquired' flag determines whether the player currently possesses the item. Items
    can be pre-acquired (starting inventory) or start unacquired and be collected during
    gameplay. This allows for collectathon gameplay where players track their progress
    toward finding all items.

    Attributes:
        id: Unique identifier for this item (e.g., "secret_key", "photo_01").
           Used for lookups, save data, and script references. Should be lowercase
           with underscores for consistency.
        name: Display name shown to the player (e.g., "Rusty Key", "Family Photo").
             Can be in any language and include special characters for presentation.
        description: Flavor text or description shown when examining the item.
                    Can be multiple sentences providing context or story information.
        image_path: Optional path to the item's full-size image file, relative to assets/images/.
                   For example, "items/key.png" or "photos/memory_01.jpg". Set to None
                   for items without visual representation. This is displayed when viewing
                   the item in detail (e.g., full-screen photo view).
        icon_path: Optional path to the item's icon/thumbnail image, relative to assets/images/.
                  For example, "icons/key_icon.png" or "photos/thumbs/memory_01_thumb.jpg".
                  This is displayed in the inventory grid as a preview. If None, the grid
                  slot will be empty (just the background color). Default is None.
        category: Item category for filtering and organization. Common categories include
                 "photo", "note", "key", "general". Categories are user-defined strings
                 and can be extended as needed. Default is "general".
        acquired: Whether the player has collected this item. True means the item is in
                 the player's possession, False means it hasn't been found yet. Can be
                 set to True initially for starting items. Default is False.

    Example:

        photo = InventoryItem(

@SystemRegistry.register
class InventoryManager(BaseSystem):
    """Manages player's inventory and item collection.

    The InventoryManager acts as a central registry for all collectible items in game.
    It maintains a master list of possible items, tracks which ones player has acquired,
    and provides methods for querying, filtering, and persisting inventory state.

    This manager supports multiple gameplay patterns:
    - **Collectathon**: Track progress toward collecting all items in a category
    - **Key items**: Gate progression behind acquiring specific items
    - **Gallery/album**: Display acquired photos or memories in a collection view
    - **Achievement tracking**: Monitor first-time inventory access for tutorials

    The manager uses a dictionary-based storage where items are indexed by their unique ID
    for O(1) lookups. Items maintain insertion order (Python 3.7+), which is important for
    displaying items in a consistent, meaningful order (e.g., chronological for photos).

    The inventory state is designed to be serializable to/from dictionaries, making it
    compatible with JSON-based save systems. The get_state() and restore_state() methods handle
    conversion between manager's internal state and save data format.

    Attributes:
        items: Dictionary mapping item IDs to InventoryItem instances. Maintains insertion
              order for consistent display. All possible items are stored here regardless
              of acquisition status.
        has_been_accessed: Boolean flag tracking whether player has opened the inventory
                          view at least once. Used for tutorial prompts, achievements, or
                          quest progression that requires checking inventory.

        and display. This method is used to dynamically add items beyond the default set,
        such as items defined in game data files or created programmatically.

        Items are stored by their unique ID. Adding an item with an ID that already exists
        will overwrite the previous item, which can be used to update item properties.

        This method does NOT automatically acquire the item for the player - it only makes

        Gives the specified item to the player by setting its acquired flag to True. This
        method is typically called when the player finds, picks up, or earns an item through
        gameplay actions.

        The method includes logic to detect whether the item is being acquired for the first
        time or was already in the player's possession. This distinction is useful for:
        - Showing "item acquired" notifications only on first pickup
        - Preventing duplicate acquisition sound effects or animations
        - Tracking which items are newly acquired vs previously owned
        - Publishing ItemAcquiredEvent only for new acquisitions

        If the item ID doesn't exist in the registry, a warning is logged and False is
        returned. This helps catch typos or missing item definitions during development.

        When an item is newly acquired, an ItemAcquiredEvent is published to the event bus
        (if one was provided during initialization), allowing scripts to react to item
        acquisition.

            False if the item was not found or was already acquired. Use this return value

        The method returns False if the item ID doesn't exist in the registry OR if the
