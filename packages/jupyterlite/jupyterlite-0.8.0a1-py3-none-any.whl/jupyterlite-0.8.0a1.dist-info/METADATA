JupyterLite is a JupyterLab distribution that **runs entirely in the browser** built
from the ground-up using JupyterLab components and extensions.

## ⚡ Status ⚡

JupyterLite is part of the [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
[Frontends subproject](https://jupyterlab-team-compass.readthedocs.io).

Not all the features available in JupyterLab and the Classic Notebook will work with
JupyterLite, but many do!

Don't hesitate to check out the
[documentation](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/howto/index.html) for more
information and project updates.

## ✨ Try it in your browser ✨

JupyterLite works with both the [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab)
and [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook) interfaces.

## 🏗️ Build your own JupyterLite 🏗️

You can build your own JupyterLite website in a couple of minutes, with custom
extensions and packages.

See the
[documentation](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart/deploy.html) for
more details.

### Browser-based Interactive Computing

JupyterLite is all about accessible browser-based interactive computing:

- Python kernels running in a Web Worker:
  - [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org) :
    [jupyterlite-pyodide-kernel](https://github.com/jupyterlite/pyodide-kernel)
  - [Xeus Python](https://xeus-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) :
    [jupyterlite-xeus](https://github.com/jupyterlite/xeus)
- Support for interactive visualization libraries such as `altair`, `bqplot`,
  `ipywidgets`, `matplotlib`, and `plotly`
- View hosted example Notebooks and other files, then edit, save, and download from the
  browser's `IndexDB` (or `localStorage`)
- Support for saving settings for JupyterLab/Lite core and federated extensions
- Basic session and kernel management to have multiple kernels running at the same time
- Support for
  [Code Consoles](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/code_console.html)

[p5.js]: https://p5js.org/

### Ease of Deployment

- Served via well-cacheable, static HTTP(S), locally or on most static web hosts
- Embeddable within larger applications
- Requires no dedicated _application server_ much less a container orchestrator
- Fine-grained configurability of page settings, including reuse of federated JupyterLab
  extensions

## Version Compatibility

The table below shows the versions of JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook bundled with each
JupyterLite core release.

for a development installation.

JupyterLite is a reboot of several attempts at making a full static Jupyter distribution
that runs in the browser, without having to start the Python Jupyter Server on the host
machine.

The goal is to provide a lightweight computing environment accessible in a matter of
seconds with a single click, in a web browser and without having to install anything.

This project is a collection of packages that can be remixed together in variety of ways
to create new applications and distributions. Most of the packages in this repo focus on
providing server-like components that run in the browser (to manage kernels, files and
settings), so existing JupyterLab extensions and plugins can be reused out of the box.
