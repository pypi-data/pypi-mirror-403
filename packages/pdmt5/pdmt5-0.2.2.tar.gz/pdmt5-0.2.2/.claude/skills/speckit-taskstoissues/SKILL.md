# Spec-Kit Tasks to Issues

Convert tasks.md into GitHub issues with proper dependencies, labels, and organization. Optional step after speckit-tasks for teams using GitHub project management.

## When to Use

- After creating tasks.md with `speckit-tasks`
- Team uses GitHub Issues for task tracking
- Want to leverage GitHub Projects, milestones, or automation
- Need to assign tasks to team members

## Execution Workflow

> **🚨 CRITICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENT 🚨**
>
> **MUST verify GitHub remote URL BEFORE creating ANY issues!**
>
> - ONLY proceed if remote is a valid GitHub URL
> - NEVER create issues in the wrong repository
> - ALWAYS confirm repository matches your intent

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` to get FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS, extract path to tasks file
2. **CRITICAL SAFETY CHECK** - Verify GitHub remote:

   ```bash
   git config --get remote.origin.url
   ```

   **ONLY proceed if:**
   - URL contains `github.com`
   - Repository matches intended target
   - You have write permission

   **NEVER create issues in wrong repository!**

3. **Parse tasks** from tasks.md - Extract:
   - Task ID (T001, T002, etc.)
   - Description with file path
   - Phase (Setup, Foundation, User Story X)
   - User Story label ([US1], [US2], etc.)
   - Parallel marker ([P])
   - Dependencies (from task order and phase structure)

4. **Create issues** - For each task, use GitHub MCP server:
   - **Title format**: `[T001] Task description from tasks.md`
   - **Body**:

     ```markdown
     **Phase:** [Phase Name]
     **Story:** [US1] or N/A
     **File:** [Specific file path from task]
     **Parallelizable:** Yes/No

     ## Description

     [Full task description]

     ## Dependencies

     [List of blocking tasks with issue links]

     ## Acceptance Criteria

     [Extracted from tasks.md or generated]

     ## Related Artifacts

     - Spec: [link to spec.md on branch]
     - Plan: [link to plan.md on branch]
     - Tasks: [link to tasks.md on branch]

     ---

     _Feature:_ [Feature Name]
     _Task ID:_ [T001]
     _Generated by speckit-taskstoissues_
     ```

   - **Metadata**:
     - Labels: `phase:setup`, `feature:[name]`, `task`, `parallel` (if [P])
     - Milestone: Feature milestone (if exists)
     - Assignee: None (unless specified)

5. **Link dependencies**:
   - **Option A - Task Lists** (recommended): Add to issue body: `## Blocked By\n- [ ] #123 (T004 Create User model)`
   - **Option B - Issue References**: Use `Depends on #123, #124`
   - **Option C - Labels**: `blocked` / `ready`

6. **Organization**:
   - Create milestones per user story
   - Apply labels by category (phase, parallel, test, feature)
   - Add to GitHub Project board if exists

## Key Points

- **Validate GitHub remote BEFORE creating any issues** - NEVER skip this check
- **Preserve task IDs** in issue titles for mapping
- **Link dependencies explicitly** using task lists or references
- **Use labels for organization** - phase, parallel, test, feature, blocked, ready
- **Include artifact links** in issue body (spec, plan, tasks on branch)
- **Create milestone per user story** for organization
- **Error handling**:
  - Rate limiting → pause and retry
  - Permission denied → abort with clear error
  - Duplicate detection → check existing issues first
- **Safety checks before ANY issue creation**:
  - Verify remote is GitHub URL
  - Extract owner/repo correctly
  - Confirm with user before proceeding

## Next Steps

After creating issues:

- **Assign** issues to team members
- **Organize** in GitHub Project board
- **Track** progress via issue updates
- **Link** PRs to issues (closes #123)
- **Update** issue status as tasks complete
