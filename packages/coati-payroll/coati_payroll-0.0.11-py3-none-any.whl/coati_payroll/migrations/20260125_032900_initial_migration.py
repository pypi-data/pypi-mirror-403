"""Initial migration - mark existing database schema

Revision ID: 20260125_032900
Revises:
Create Date: 2026-01-25 03:29:00

This is the initial migration that marks the existing database schema as the base.
This migration doesn't create or modify any tables - it assumes that the database
was already initialized using db.create_all() before implementing flask-alembic.

For new databases, the schema will be created by db.create_all() in the
ensure_database_initialized() function, and then this migration will be stamped
as 'head' to mark the database as up to date.

For existing databases, this migration should be stamped as 'head' without running
any actual migrations, as the database already contains all the tables.
