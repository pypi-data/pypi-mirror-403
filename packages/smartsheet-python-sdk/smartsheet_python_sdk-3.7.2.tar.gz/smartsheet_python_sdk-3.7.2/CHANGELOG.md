### Changed

In our efforts to further streamline the SDK, enumerated properties have been changed from type String to type EnumeratedValue, which wraps Python Enum.
In addition to allowing us to remove a number of redundant string arrays, this also provides the benefit of better code completion (in most IDEs)
and provides for more programmatic clarity, for example:

 ```python
sheet = smartsheet.Sheets.get_sheet(sheet_id)
if sheet.access_level == AccessLevel.OWNER:
    # perform some task for OWNER
    ...
```

However, string comparisons will continue to operate as they did previously. No change is required if your code uses comparisons such as:

```python
sheet = smartsheet.Sheets.get_sheet(sheet_id)
if sheet.access_level == 'OWNER':
    # perform some task for OWNER
    ...
```

[enum34](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34) has been added as a required package for the SDK

## [1.3.0] - 2018-02-21

### Changed

Several changes have been made to the SDK to improve both the maintainability of the SDK and the predictability/reliability of the results returned by the SDK. Some of these changes may be breaking to code that currently uses the SDK. The following changes should be reviewed:

- The JSON serializer has been changed to ignore `null` values and empty lists (`[]`). A new Smartsheet model, ExplicitNull, is provided for circumstances where there is a need to force the serialization of a null value. As an example, to clear a hyperlink value from a cell, you can perform the following operation:

```python
        first_row = Row()
        first_row.id = 10
        first_row.cells.append({
            "columnId": 101,
            "value": "",
            "hyperlink": ExplicitNull()
        })

        response = self.client.Sheets.update_rows(1, [first_row])
```

- Property values are more strongly type checked on assignment and you will get a `ValueError` exception if you attempt to assign an incompatible object. Previously, there were a number of cases where assignment of incompatible types would have resulted in a silent failure by the SDK.
- In previous releases, property filters were executed prior to create or update operations on many models within the SDK. Unfortunately, those filters were sometimes at odds with the API and occasionally returned unpredictable results. For that reason those filters have been removed. Be aware that any property that is set in a model will be passed through to the API.
- Properties `id`, `format`, and `type` are accessible without the preceding underscore, e.g. `cell._format` has changed to `cell.format`.

## [1.2.4] - 2018-02-21

### Fixed

- There is a race condition which exists in the window between when the API servers disconnect an idle connection and when the client receives notification
of the disconnection. If a request is made during that window, the client reads a blank status line and issues an error indicating that the session was
terminated without a response (UnexpectedRequestError). This release is made to address that issue by implementing appropriate retries in the SDK.

## [1.2.3] - 2017-12-11

### Fixed

- Safe defaults for mock api test name and module name

## [1.2.2] - 2017-12-07

### Added

- Support for column validation
- New `Passthrough` object supports `get`, `post`, `put`, or `delete` with arbitrary json payload. Use this for access to any API feature that isn't yet modeled in the API. Requests still benefit from error retry and logging.

- `add_image_to_cell` & `attach_file_to_cell`: Now support `override_validation` and `alt_text` parameters
- `copy_folder`, `copy_workspace` and `copy_sheet`: Additional options for `include`, `skip_remap`, and `omit` parameters
- Support for `include=sheetVersion` for several endpoints that return a list of sheets
- Support for reading sheet filters
- More flags when publishing Sheets or Reports as HTML
- Search
  - Results include favorite information
  - Limit search scope

### Changed

- Mock tests
- Improved logging

### Fixed

- Sight widget column property name
