# Contributing to Smartsheet Python SDK

## Issue First Approach

**All contributions to the Smartsheet Python SDK must begin with a GitHub Issue.** This includes bug fixes, new features, and documentation improvements.

For detailed guidance on creating effective issues that work well with both human reviewers and AI-powered Cloud Agents, see our [Issue First documentation](ISSUE-FIRST.md).

## Did you find a bug?

- **Send all security related bugs to our maintainer email, <sdk-python@smartsheet.com>**.

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-python-sdk/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-python-sdk/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **[MRE code sample](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example)** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. If possible please also note if this issue concerns the API itself or just the Python SDK.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- **First, ensure there is a GitHub issue** describing the bug (see above).

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch, referencing the issue number.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number.

- A maintainer should review your PR within the next few days. If the PR has been dormant for more than a week, consider sending an email to <sdk-python@smartsheet.com>

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability may take longer to review, but are still welcome. Please create an issue first describing the cosmetic changes you'd like to make.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- **First, create an issue** with the label #enhancement. Make sure that your new feature description outlines why this would be helpful for users, and how difficult a change it would be to make.

- Once the feature is discussed and approved in the issue, you can submit a pull request implementing it.

## Code Style and Quality

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines for Python code.

- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly describe their purpose.

- Include docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods following [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) conventions.

- Run pylint on your code before submitting a PR. The project includes a pylintrc file with project-specific settings.

- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes. All tests should pass before submitting a PR.

## Documentation

- If your changes affect the public API, you must update the corresponding Sphinx documentation files in `docs-source/`:
  - **API Resources** (modules in `smartsheet/`): Update `docs-source/smartsheet_api.rst`
  - **Models** (classes in `smartsheet/models/`): Update `docs-source/smartsheet_models.rst`
  - **Enums** (enums in `smartsheet/models/enums/`): Update `docs-source/smartsheet_enums.rst`
  - **Types** (type definitions in `smartsheet/types.py`): Update `docs-source/smartsheet_types.rst`
  - **Exceptions** (exceptions in `smartsheet/exceptions.py`): Update `docs-source/smartsheet_exceptions.rst`
  - **General documentation** (installation, quickstart, examples): Update `docs-source/index.rst`

- The documentation uses Sphinx with autodoc to generate API documentation from docstrings. Ensure your docstrings follow Google-style format as configured in `docs-source/conf.py`.

- After making changes to `docs-source/`, you can build the documentation locally to verify your changes:

  ```bash
  cd docs-source
  make html
  ```

- The built documentation will be in `docs-source/_build/html/`. Open `index.html` in a browser to review your changes.

## Running Tests

- To run the test suite, use the following command:

  ```bash
  python -m pytest tests/
  ```

- For integration tests, you'll need to set up your Smartsheet API access token as an environment variable:

  ```bash
  export SMARTSHEET_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
  ```

## Do you have questions about the source code or using the SDK?

- For general information on the API and its uses, see the [Smartsheet API Reference](https://smartsheet.redoc.ly/)

- For information on the Python SDK, see the [Smartsheet Python SDK Documentation](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-python-sdk#readme) or review the [basic](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-python-sdk#readme) and [advanced](https://github.com/smartsheet/smartsheet-python-sdk/blob/master/ADVANCED.md) READMEs!

- Github issues can also be used for questions on using the Python SDK specifically.

Thanks!
