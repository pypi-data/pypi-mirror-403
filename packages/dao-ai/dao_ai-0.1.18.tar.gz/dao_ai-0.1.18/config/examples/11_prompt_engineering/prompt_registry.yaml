# Multi-Agent AI Orchestration Framework Configuration
# =============================================================================
# This configuration file demonstrates the complete setup for a multi-agent system
# including schemas, resources, tools, agents, and orchestration patterns.
#
# NEW FEATURE: MLflow Prompt Registry Integration
# ================================================
# This example showcases how to use MLflow Prompt Registry for centralized
# prompt management. Key benefits:
#
# 1. Version Control: Track prompt changes over time with versioning
# 2. Centralized Management: Store prompts in MLflow instead of config files
# 3. External Updates: Prompt engineers can update prompts without code changes
# 4. Environment Management: Use aliases (production, staging) for different environments
# 5. A/B Testing: Easily switch between prompt versions for testing
#
# Prompts can be:
# - Loaded from MLflow Prompt Registry (preferred)
# - Fall back to default_template if registry unavailable
# - Pinned to specific versions for stability
# - Referenced using aliases for flexibility
#
# See the "PROMPTS CONFIGURATION" section below for detailed examples.

      #### Recommendation Process
      1. **Understand Requirements**: Ask clarifying questions about needs, budget, and preferences

      3. **Present Options**: Typically 2-3 options at different price/feature levels
      4. **Explain Rationale**: Why each recommendation fits their needs

      - Space or size constraints
      - Compatibility with existing equipment
      - Future needs and expandability

      #### Recommendation Structure
      - **Budget Option**: Good value, meets basic needs
      - **Mid-Range Option**: Better features/quality balance
      - **Premium Option**: Best features/quality (when appropriate)

# ==============================================================================
# AGENTS CONFIGURATION  
# ==============================================================================
# Agents can use prompts in two ways:
# 1. Inline prompt strings (traditional approach - shown below)
# 2. Prompt references (new approach - using prompts defined above)
#
# To use a prompt reference, replace the inline prompt with:
#   prompt: *general_prompt
#
# Example:
#   general:
#     name: general
#     model: *tool_calling_llm
#     prompt: *general_prompt  # References the prompt from the prompts section
#
# Benefits of using prompt references:
# - Centralized prompt management
# - Version control through MLflow Prompt Registry
# - Easy A/B testing with different prompt versions
# - External team can update prompts without code changes
# ==============================================================================
