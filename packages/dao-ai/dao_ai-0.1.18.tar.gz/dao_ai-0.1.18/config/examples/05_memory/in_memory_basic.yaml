# In-Memory Configuration Example
# =============================================================================
# This configuration demonstrates in-memory conversation state management.
# 
# Features:
# - No external database required
# - State persists only during the session
# - Fastest performance (no I/O overhead)
# - Ideal for: development, testing, stateless applications
#
# Limitations:
# - State is lost when process terminates
# - Cannot resume conversations after restart
# - Not suitable for production long-term conversations

    prompt: |
      You are a helpful assistant. You can remember context from earlier in the
      conversation, but your memory is ephemeral - it won't persist after the
      session ends.
      
      Engage naturally and reference previous parts of the conversation when relevant.

# =============================================================================
# MEMORY CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================
# In-memory mode: Simply include the agent without memory or chat_history config
# The conversation state is maintained in memory for the duration of the session
