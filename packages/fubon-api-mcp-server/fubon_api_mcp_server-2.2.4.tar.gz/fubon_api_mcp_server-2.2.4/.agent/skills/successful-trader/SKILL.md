# Successful Trader Skill

This skill provides you with structured methodologies and best practices for trading success. Use this when assisting users with trading strategies, market analysis, risk management, or developing trading systems.

## Core Trading Principles

### 1. Risk Management (Most Critical)
- **Never risk more than 1-2% of capital per trade**
- **Position sizing formula**: Risk Amount / (Entry Price - Stop Loss) = Position Size
- **Use stop-loss orders on every trade** - no exceptions
- **Risk/Reward ratio**: Aim for minimum 1:2 (risk $1 to potentially make $2)
- **Maximum daily loss limit**: Stop trading if you hit 3-5% daily loss
- **Diversification**: Don't put all capital in one asset or sector

### 2. Trading Plan Development
Every trader must have a written trading plan that includes:

### 7. Key Performance Metrics to Track

#### Essential KPIs
- **Win Rate**: (Winning Trades / Total Trades) × 100
- **Average Win**: Total Profit / Number of Winning Trades
- **Average Loss**: Total Loss / Number of Losing Trades
- **Profit Factor**: Gross Profit / Gross Loss (should be > 1.5)
- **Expectancy**: (Win Rate × Avg Win) - (Loss Rate × Avg Loss)
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns (> 1.0 is good)
- **Recovery Factor**: Net Profit / Max Drawdown

#### Monthly Review Questions
1. What was my overall P&L?
2. What was my best trade and why?
3. What was my worst trade and why?
4. Did I follow my trading plan consistently?
5. What patterns do I notice in my winning trades?
6. What patterns do I notice in my losing trades?
7. What should I adjust for next month?

## Trading Strategy Templates

### Strategy 1: Trend Following
```
1. Identify trend on daily chart (price above 200 SMA = uptrend)
2. Wait for pullback to 20 or 50 EMA
3. Look for reversal candlestick pattern at EMA
4. Enter long when price breaks above reversal candle high
5. Stop loss: Below recent swing low or 1.5× ATR
6. Take profit: 2× risk amount or at next resistance
```

### Strategy 2: Breakout Trading
```
1. Identify consolidation pattern (triangle, rectangle, flag)
2. Mark resistance (for upside breakout) or support (for downside)
3. Wait for volume spike + candle close beyond pattern
4. Enter on retest of broken level or immediate breakout
5. Stop loss: Inside the pattern or below breakout candle
6. Take profit: Pattern height projected from breakout point
```

### Strategy 3: Mean Reversion
```
1. Identify range-bound market (ADX < 25)
2. Wait for price to reach upper or lower Bollinger Band
3. Confirm with RSI oversold (<30) or overbought (>70)
4. Enter when price shows rejection (e.g., pin bar, engulfing)
5. Stop loss: Beyond the band extreme
6. Take profit: Middle Bollinger Band (20 SMA)
```

## Risk Management Formulas

### Position Size Calculator
```
Account Size: $10,000
Risk Per Trade: 1% = $100
Entry Price: $50
Stop Loss: $48
Risk Per Share: $50 - $48 = $2

Position Size = Risk Amount / Risk Per Share
Position Size = $100 / $2 = 50 shares

Total Position Value = 50 × $50 = $2,500
```

### Kelly Criterion (Advanced Position Sizing)
```
Kelly % = W - [(1 - W) / R]

Where:
W = Win rate (e.g., 0.55 for 55%)
R = Average Win / Average Loss ratio (e.g., 2)

Example:
Kelly % = 0.55 - [(1 - 0.55) / 2]
Kelly % = 0.55 - 0.225 = 0.325 or 32.5%

Note: Use 1/4 to 1/2 of Kelly % for conservative sizing
Recommended position = 8-16% of account in this example
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Fatal Errors
1. ❌ **No stop loss** - Always use stops
2. ❌ **Risking too much** - Never exceed 2% per trade
3. ❌ **No trading plan** - You're gambling, not trading
4. ❌ **Revenge trading** - Emotional decisions after losses
5. ❌ **Overleverage** - Using excessive margin/leverage
6. ❌ **Ignoring fees** - Commissions and slippage eat profits
7. ❌ **Trading against trend** - Trend is your friend
8. ❌ **No journaling** - Can't improve what you don't track

### Rookie Mistakes
- Checking positions constantly (leads to emotional decisions)
- Moving stop losses further away when price approaches them
- Taking profits too early on winners but letting losers run
- Trading too many markets or instruments at once
- Following "hot tips" from social media or chat rooms
- Not accounting for bid-ask spread and slippage
- Trading during low liquidity hours
- Ignoring major news events that can cause volatility

## Market Conditions & Adaptation

### Bull Market (Rising prices, optimism)
- Focus on buying dips
- Trend following strategies excel
- Hold winners longer
- Reduce short positions

### Bear Market (Falling prices, pessimism)
- Focus on shorting rallies or staying cash
- Mean reversion at support levels
- Tighter profit targets
- Increase cash allocation

### Sideways/Range Market (Choppy, no clear trend)
- Mean reversion strategies work best
- Sell at resistance, buy at support
- Avoid trend-following systems
- Reduce position sizes (harder to predict)

### High Volatility
- Reduce position sizes (wider stops needed)
- Increase profit targets (bigger moves available)
- Be prepared for gaps and slippage
- Consider options strategies for protection

### Low Volatility
- May need to use leverage carefully for adequate returns
- Tighter stops possible
- Breakout strategies may underperform
- Consider switching timeframes
