    The following ANSI colour codes are used to decorate the elements of the log messages:
        Timestamp and punctuation: '\\x1b[30;2m' (black text, dim)
        Log levels:
            NOTSET   (0) : '\\x1b[30;1m' (black text, bold)
            DEBUG    (10): '\\x1b[35;1m' (magenta text, bold)
            INFO     (20): '\\x1b[37;1m' (white text, bold)
            WARNING  (30): '\\x1b[33;1m' (yellow text, bold)
            ERROR    (40): '\\x1b[31;1m' (red text, bold)
            CRITICAL (50): '\\x1b[41;1m' (red background, bold)
        Logger name:    '\\x1b[34m' (blue text)
        Exception text: '\\x1b[31m' (red text)
        Log message:     default colour / no custom formatting

    ANSI codes are a bit weird to decipher if you're unfamiliar with them, so here's a refresher
    It starts off with a format like \\x1b[###m where ### is a semicolon separated list of commands
    The important ones here relate to colour.
    30-37 are black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white in that order
    40-47 are the same except for the background
    90-97 are the same but "bright" foreground
    100-107 are the same as the bright ones but for the background.
    1 means bold, 2 means dim, 0 means reset, and 4 means underline.
