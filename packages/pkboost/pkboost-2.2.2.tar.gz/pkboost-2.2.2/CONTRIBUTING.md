## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions Welcome

- **Bug fixes** - Found a bug? We'd love a fix!
- **Performance improvements** - Make PKBoost faster
- **New features** - Extend functionality (discuss first in an issue)
- **Documentation** - Improve docs, examples, or tutorials
- **Tests** - Increase test coverage
- **Benchmarks** - Add new benchmark datasets or scenarios

### Before You Start

For significant changes, please **open an issue first** to discuss:
- What problem you're solving
- Your proposed approach
- Any breaking changes

This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures alignment with project goals.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.70+** (install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Python 3.8+** (for Python bindings testing)
- **8GB+ RAM** recommended for large dataset benchmarks

### Building

```bash
# Debug build
cargo build

# Release build (for benchmarks)
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Build documentation
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Main benchmark
cargo run --release --bin benchmark

# Drift tests
cargo run --release --bin test_drift

# Multi-class benchmark
cargo run --release --bin multiclass_benchmark
```

### Python Bindings

```bash
# Install maturin
pip install maturin

# Build and install locally
maturin develop --release

# Run Python tests
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Coding Standards

### Rust Style

- Follow the [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/)
- Use `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` and address warnings
- Write descriptive commit messages

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check for common mistakes
cargo clippy

# Run all checks before PR
cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo test
```

### Documentation

- Add doc comments (`///`) to all public items
- Include examples in doc comments where helpful
- Update README.md if adding major features

### Testing

- Add tests for new functionality
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Include both unit tests and integration tests where appropriate

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, documented code
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
```

Use conventional commit messages:
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only
- `perf:` - Performance improvement
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 4. Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- Clear title describing the change
- Description of what and why
- Reference to related issues (if any)
- Screenshots/benchmarks for performance changes

### 5. Review Process
