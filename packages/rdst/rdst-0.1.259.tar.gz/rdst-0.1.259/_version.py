RDST Version Information

This file contains the manually-managed major and minor version numbers.
The build system will automatically append patch and build numbers:
- major.minor (e.g., 0.1) - manually set in this file
- major.minor.patch (e.g., 0.1.123) - patch = Buildkite build number (for releases)
- major.minor.0.dev<timestamp> (e.g., 0.1.0.dev20251204123456) - for dev builds

To update the version:
1. Increment MAJOR for breaking changes
2. Increment MINOR for new features (and reset MAJOR to 0 if needed)
3. Patch and build numbers are auto-generated by the build system

Versioning scheme follows semantic versioning:
- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH for releases (e.g., 1.0.123)
- MAJOR.MINOR.0.devYYYYMMDDHHMMSS for dev builds (e.g., 1.0.0.dev20251204123456)
