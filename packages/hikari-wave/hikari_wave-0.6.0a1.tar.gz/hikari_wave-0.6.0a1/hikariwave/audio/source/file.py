        ----------
        filepath : str
            The filepath to the audio file.
        duration : float | None
            If provided, the duration of this source - Required if using player timestamp properties/fields.
        bitrate : str | None
            If provided, the bitrate in which to play this source back at.
        channels : int | None
            If provided, the amount of channels this source plays with.
        name : str | None
            If provided, an internal name used for display purposes.
        volume : float | str | None
            If provided, overrides the player's set/default volume. Can be scaled (`0.5`, `1.0`, `2.0`, etc.) or dB-based (`-3dB`, etc.).
