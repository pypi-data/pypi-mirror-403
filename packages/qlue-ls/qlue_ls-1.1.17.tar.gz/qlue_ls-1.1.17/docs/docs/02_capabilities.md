# :rocket: Capabilities

Qlue-s provides SPARQL support to your editor (or tool).
These are structured in Capabilities.

## ✨ Completion

Completion provides suggestions how the query could continue.

Completions are invoked automatically by your editor or by the user
(usually by the key combination `ctrl` + `space`). They are also triggered when the user types `?`.


Qlue-ls provides different types of completions:

### Variable completion

When a user types a word beginning with `?`, all variables in scope will be returned.

<figure class="video_container">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true">
    <source src="../assets/completion_var.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</figure>

!!! warning

    Variable completion should work everywhere where variables are allowed.
    However, note that collecting variables after the cursor is harder then before the cursor
    and might not work as expected.

### SPO completion

!!! warning

    For SPO completions a backend has to be configured

**S**ubject, **P**redicate, **O**bject completions are triggered when the cursor is
in a [GraphPattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#rGroupGraphPattern).

Qlue-ls sends 2 queries to the backend, retrieving possible continuations.
One with constraining context, one without.
If the context-sensitive query failed, the context-free one is used as a fallback.


Note that the quality of the result depends on the query, while the speed depends on the
triple store.

To get really good SPO completions, [custom completion queries](/06_completion_queries) are required.

## 📐 Formatting

Format SPARQL queries to ensure consistent and readable syntax.
Customizable options to align with preferred query styles are also implemented.


## 🩺 Diagnostics

Diagnostics provide feadback on the query.
Diagnostics come in severity: ❌ error, ⚠️ warning and ℹ️ info.

Here is a complete list of diagnostics qlue-ls can provide:

| Type        | Name                        | Description                                       |
|:------------|:----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| ❌ error    | undefined prefix            | a used prefix is not declared                     |
| ❌ error    | ungrouped select variable   | a selected variable is not in the group by clause |
| ❌ error    | invalid projection variable | projection variable is already defined            |
| ⚠️  warning | unused prefix               | a declared prefix is not used                     |
| ℹ️  info    | uncompacted uri             | a raw uncompacted uri is used                     |
| ℹ️  info    | same subject                | multiple triples have the same subject            |

## ℹ️ Hover

For example when the user hovers a `FILTER`  the server returns a explanation about what a Filter is

and how to use it.

When a backend is configured, the server will access to knowledge-graph to get information about the token.
For example if the user hovers `osmrel:62768` and a hover request is send, Qlue-ls will respond with
**"Freiburg im Breisgau"** as this is the label of `osmrel:62768`.

!!! note

    The query used to retrieve information about a iri, can be configured.

## 🛠️ Code Actions

Code action suggest complex changes to your input.
Often in the form of a *quickfix*, to fix a diagnostic.

| name                     | description                             | diagnostic        |
|:-------------------------|:----------------------------------------|:------------------|
| shorten uri              | shorten uri into compacted form         | uncompacted uri   |
| declare prefix           | declares undeclared prefix (if known)   | undeclared prefix |
| contract triples         | contract triples with same subject      | same subject      |
| shorten all uri's        | shorten all uri's into compacted form   |                   |
| add to result            | add variable to selected result         |                   |
| filter variable          | add filter for this variable            |                   |
| add label                | add rdfs:label with a language filter   |                   |
| lang-filter              | add language filter for object variable |                   |
| transform into subselect | make a select into a subselect          |                   |

## Custom Capabilities

Qlue-ls also introduces custom capabilities.
That means your lsp-client will not have support for it.
You will have to hack your lsp-client to use this.

### 🕳 Jump

This capability enables "tab navigation".
The server provides the next, or previous relevant position in the query.
The LSP-client has to move the cursor to this position.
This enables the user to quickly jump to relevalt positions in the query.


*Request*:

- method: 'qlueLs/jump'
- params: `JumpParams` defined as follows:

```ts
export interface JumpParams extends TextDocumentPositionParams {
	previous?: boolean;
}
```

*Response*:

- result: `JumpResult` | `null` defined as follows:

```ts
export interface JumpResult {
	position: Position;
    insert_before: string | null;
    insert_after: string | null;
}
```

### ❓ operation identification

Determine if a operation is a query or update.

*Request*:

- method: 'qlueLs/identifyOperationType'
- params: `IdentifyOperationTypeParams` defined as follows:

```ts
export interface IdentifyOperationTypeParams {
	textDocument: TextDocumentIdentifier;
}
```

*Response*:

- result: `IdentifyOperationTypeResult` defined as follows:

```ts
export interface IdentifyOperationTypeResult {
    OperationType: OperationType
}
```

```ts
export enum OperationType {
  Query = "Query",
  Update = "Update",
  Unknown = "Unknown"
}
```
