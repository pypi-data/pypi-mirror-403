# pulser-simulation

[Pulser](https://pypi.org/project/pulser/) is a framework for composing, simulating and executing **pulse** sequences for neutral-atom quantum devices.

This is the `pulser-simulation` extension, which provides the functionalities needed to emulate `pulser` sequences.

## Installation

The standard Pulser installation,

```bash
pip install pulser
```

will automatically install `pulser-simulation`. If you wish to install it on its own, you can also run

```bash
pip install pulser-simulation
```

Note that `pulser-core` is a requirement of `pulser-simulation`, so it will be installed if it hasn't been already.
