**Do not use System.Drawing.Common but the platform-independent Aspose.Drawing.**

### Get Started

Ready to give Aspose.PSD for Python a try?

Simply run ```pip install aspose-psd``` from the console to fetch the package. If you already have Aspose.PSD for Python and want to upgrade the version, please run ```pip install --upgrade aspose-psd``` to get the latest version.

You can run the following snippets in your environment to see how Aspose.PSD works, or check out the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aspose-psd/Aspose.PSD-for-Python-Net) or [Aspose.PSD for Python Documentation](https://docs.aspose.com/psd/python-net/) for other common use cases.

### Open PSD File in Python and update text
``` python

from aspose.psd import Image
from aspose.psd.fileformats.png import PngColorType
from aspose.psd.fileformats.psd import PsdImage
from aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers import TextLayer
from aspose.psd.imageloadoptions import PsdLoadOptions
from aspose.psd.imageoptions import PngOptions
from aspose.pycore import cast

# Specify File Paths
sourceFile = "AllTypesLayerPsd.psd"
outputFile = "LoadImageExample.png"

# Specify Load Options
loadOptions = PsdLoadOptions()
loadOptions.load_effects_resource = True
loadOptions.allow_warp_repaint = True

# Specify Export Options
exportOptions = PngOptions()
exportOptions.color_type = PngColorType.TRUECOLOR_WITH_ALPHA

# Open File using Aspose.PSD for Python
with Image.load(sourceFile, loadOptions) as image:
    # Types of Aspose.PSD can be casted
    psdImage = cast(PsdImage, image)
    textLayer = cast(TextLayer, psdImage.layers[5])
    textLayer.update_text("Simple Text Edit")

    # Export PSD File To PNG
    psdImage.save(outputFile, exportOptions)

```

### Create a PSD File From Scratch. Create Regular Layer using Graphics API and Create Text Layer with Shadow Effect
``` python

from aspose.psd import Graphics, Pen, Color, Rectangle
from aspose.psd.brushes import LinearGradientBrush
from aspose.psd.fileformats.psd import PsdImage

outputFile = "CreateFileFromScratchExample.psd"

# Create PSD Image with specified dimensions
with PsdImage(500, 500) as img:
    # Create Regular PSD Layer and update it with Graphic API
    regularLayer = img.add_regular_layer()

    # Use popular Graphic API for Editing
    graphics = Graphics(regularLayer)
    pen = Pen(Color.alice_blue)
    brush = LinearGradientBrush(Rectangle(250, 250, 150, 100), Color.red, Color.aquamarine, 45)
    graphics.draw_ellipse(pen, Rectangle(100, 100, 200, 200))
    graphics.fill_ellipse(brush, Rectangle(250, 250, 150, 100))

    # Create Text Layer
    textLayer = img.add_text_layer("Sample Text", Rectangle(200, 200, 100, 100))

    # Adding Shadow to Text
    dropShadowEffect = textLayer.blending_options.add_drop_shadow()
    dropShadowEffect.distance = 0
    dropShadowEffect.size = 8
    dropShadowEffect.color = Color.blue

    # Save PSD File
    img.save(outputFile)
```

### Add Image File as a Layer or Open Image File as a PSD
``` python

from io import BytesIO
from aspose.psd.fileformats.psd import PsdImage
from aspose.psd.fileformats.psd.layers import Layer

inputFile = "inputFile.png"
outputFile = "AddFileAsLayer.psd"

# Open file as Stream
with open(inputFile, "rb", buffering=0) as filestream:
    stream = BytesIO(filestream.read())
    stream.seek(0)

    # Create PSD Layer from Stream
    layer = Layer(stream)

    # Create PSD Image with the specified size
    psdImage = PsdImage(layer.width, layer.height)

    # Add Layer to PSD Image
    psdImage.layers = [layer]

    # Get Pixels from File
    pixels = layer.load_argb_32_pixels(layer.bounds)
    pixelsRange = range(len(pixels))

    # Fill the pixels data with some values
    for i in pixelsRange:
        if i % 5 == 0:
            pixels[i] = 500000

    # Fast Save of Updated Image Data
    layer.save_argb_32_pixels(layer.bounds, pixels)

    # Save PSD Image
    psdImage.save(outputFile)
```


### Set License Example
``` python

from aspose.psd import License

license = License()
licensePath = "PathToLicenseFile"
license.set_license(licensePath)

```
