# CommitGen

**AI-powered Conventional Commit message generator for Git**

Stop writing bad commit messages. CommitGen uses AI to analyze your staged changes and generates clean, structured commits that follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.

![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/commitgen-tool)
![Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/commitgen-tool)
![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/commitgen-tool)

## Features

- Generate Conventional Commit messages from staged changes
- Interactive CLI with inline or editor-based editing
- Support for Git workflows of any size

```bash
# Before CommitGen
git commit -m "fix stuff"
git commit -m "final fix"
git commit -m "pls work"

# With CommitGen
[FIX]: resolve null pointer in authentication handler
[FEAT]: add user session management with Redis
[DOCS]: update API documentation with examples
```

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install commitgen-tool
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.10+
- Git installed and configured
- **OpenAI API key with available tokens** (currently required)

> ⚠️ **Important**: This version requires an OpenAI API key and uses paid API calls. Support for free local LLMs is planned for future releases.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Set up your OpenAI API key (one-time setup)
commitgen config
# Enter your API key when prompted

# 2. Stage your changes
git add .

# 3. Generate and commit
commitgen commit
```

That's it! CommitGen will analyze your diff and suggest a commit message.

---

## Getting an OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key
5. Add credits to your account (pay-as-you-go)

**Cost**: Approximately $0.001-0.01 per commit message (very affordable!)

You can set usage limits in your OpenAI dashboard to control costs.

---

## Basic Usage

### Generate a Commit

```bash
commitgen commit
```

You'll see a suggested message:

```
💡 Suggested Commit Message
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [FEAT]: add user authentication endpoint │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘

(a)ccept, (r)egenerate with context, (i)nline edit, (e)xtended editor, or (q)uit?
```

### Options When Reviewing

- `a` - Accept and commit immediately
- `r` - Add context to refine the message
- `i` - Edit the message in your terminal
- `e` - Open your preferred text editor
- `q` - Quit without committing

### Commit and Push

```bash
# Commit and push in one command
commitgen commit --push

# Or use the short flag
commitgen commit -p
```

### Other Commands

```bash
# Configure API key
commitgen config

# Show version
commitgen version

# Get help
commitgen --help
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Analyzes Your Changes**: Reads `git diff --staged` to see what you've modified
2. **AI Processing**: Sends the diff to OpenAI's GPT-5-nano model with instructions to generate a Conventional Commit
3. **Interactive Review**: Lets you accept, edit, or regenerate the message
4. **Safe Commit**: Only commits after you approve the message

> **Current Model**: CommitGen uses GPT-5-nano for fast, cost-effective commit generation. Model selection will be configurable in future releases.

### What Gets Sent to OpenAI?

Only your git diff is sent - not your entire codebase. The diff shows:
- Which files changed
- What lines were added/removed
- Function and variable names in the changes

**Privacy Note**: If you're working with sensitive code, review the diff before committing or consider waiting for local LLM support.

---

## Conventional Commit Types

CommitGen automatically categorizes your changes:

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `FEAT` | New features | `[FEAT]: add OAuth2 authentication` |
| `FIX` | Bug fixes | `[FIX]: resolve memory leak in cache` |
| `DOCS` | Documentation | `[DOCS]: add API endpoint examples` |
| `STYLE` | Code formatting | `[STYLE]: apply black formatter` |
| `REFACTOR` | Code restructuring | `[REFACTOR]: extract helper functions` |
| `PERF` | Performance improvements | `[PERF]: optimize database queries` |
| `TEST` | Adding tests | `[TEST]: add unit tests for auth` |
| `CHORE` | Maintenance | `[CHORE]: update dependencies` |
| `CI` | CI/CD changes | `[CI]: add GitHub Actions workflow` |

---

## Configuration

CommitGen stores your API key securely in:

- **Linux/macOS**: `~/.config/commitgen/config.env`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\commitgen\config.env`

The key is stored locally and never transmitted except to OpenAI's API.

⚠️ **Never commit this file to Git**

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Feature

```bash
# You made changes to add a login endpoint
git add src/auth.py

commitgen commit
```

**Generated:**
```
[FEAT]: add user login endpoint with JWT tokens
```

---

### Example 2: Multiple Changes

```bash
# You updated API, tests, and docs
git add src/api.py tests/test_api.py README.md

commitgen commit
```

**Generated:**
```
[FEAT]: add user registration endpoint
[TEST]: add integration tests for registration
[DOCS]: update README with API examples
```

---

### Example 3: Bug Fix with Context

```bash
commitgen commit
```

When prompted, choose `(r)` to regenerate with context:

```
Add context: Fixes issue #123 where special characters broke login
```

**Generated:**
```
[FIX]: sanitize special characters in login handler

Fixes #123
```

---

### Example 4: Using Extended Editor

Choose `(e)` to open your editor:

```bash
# CommitGen opens your $GIT_EDITOR with:

# CommitGen – Extended Commit Message Editor
#
# Save the file before closing to apply changes.
# Lines starting with '#' will be ignored.
#

[FEAT]: add user authentication
```

Edit, save (`Ctrl+S`), and close. CommitGen will use your edited message.

---

## Setting Your Preferred Editor

CommitGen respects the same editor settings as Git.

### VS Code (Recommended)

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
setx GIT_EDITOR "code --wait"
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
echo 'export GIT_EDITOR="code --wait"' >> ~/.bashrc
# or for zsh:
echo 'export GIT_EDITOR="code --wait"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Other Editors

**Vim:**
```bash
export GIT_EDITOR=vim
```

**Nano:**
```bash
export GIT_EDITOR=nano
```

**Sublime Text:**
```bash
export GIT_EDITOR="subl -w"
```

---

## Workflow Integration

### Typical Development Flow

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
vim src/feature.py

# 2. Stage what you want to commit
git add src/feature.py

# 3. Let CommitGen handle the message
commitgen commit

# 4. Push when ready
git push
```

### Working with Unstaged Changes

If you run `commitgen commit` without staging:

```
No staged changes detected.
(a) stage all, (s) select files, (q) quit?
```

- `a` - Stages everything (`git add .`)
- `s` - Lets you pick specific files
- `q` - Exits so you can stage manually

---

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
commitgen config
# Enter your API key
```

Your key is stored in `~/.config/commitgen/config.env`

---

### "You are not inside a Git repository"

**Solution:** Navigate to a Git repository or initialize one:
```bash
git init
```

---

### "No staged changes detected"

**Solution:** Stage your changes first:
```bash
git add <files>
# or
git add .
```

---

### Editor doesn't wait for save

If using VS Code, ensure you have the `--wait` flag:

```bash
# Check your setting
echo $GIT_EDITOR

# Should show: code --wait
# If not, set it:
export GIT_EDITOR="code --wait"
```

---

### Generic/unclear commit messages

**Solution:** Use the regenerate option with context:

1. Choose `(r)` when prompted
2. Provide specific details about what changed
3. CommitGen will regenerate with your context

Example:
```
Add context: Optimized query performance by adding database indexes
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing the Workflow

**Skip the push prompt:**
```bash
# Always push after commit
commitgen commit --push

# Never get asked to push
# (just press 'n' when prompted)
```

**Working with branches:**
```bash
# CommitGen works with any branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
# ... make changes ...
commitgen commit
```

**Amending commits:**
```bash
# CommitGen doesn't amend, but you can after:
git commit --amend
```

---

## Comparison with Alternatives

### vs Manual Writing

| Manual | CommitGen |
|--------|-----------|
| ❌ Inconsistent format | ✅ Always follows Conventional Commits |
| ❌ Vague messages | ✅ Specific, contextual descriptions |
| ❌ Prone to typos | ✅ Properly formatted |
| ❌ Time-consuming | ✅ Instant generation |

### vs GitHub Copilot

| Copilot | CommitGen |
|---------|-----------|
| Only suggests based on file names | Analyzes actual diff content |
| Generic suggestions | Context-aware with GPT-5-nano |
| No editing workflow | Interactive review and editing |
| No multiple change handling | Handles FEAT + FIX + DOCS in one commit |
| Fixed model | Model selection coming soon |

---

## Security & Privacy

### What CommitGen Sends to OpenAI

- ✅ Git diff (added/removed lines)
- ✅ File paths
- ❌ Your full source code
- ❌ Git history
- ❌ Credentials or secrets

### API Key Storage

- Stored locally in `~/.config/commitgen/`
- Never transmitted except to OpenAI
- Never logged or committed

### Best Practices

1. **Review diffs before committing** - Ensure no secrets are staged
2. **Use `.gitignore`** - Keep sensitive files out of commits
3. **Set OpenAI usage limits** - Control API costs in your OpenAI dashboard
4. **Use environment variables for secrets** - Never hardcode credentials

## FAQ

### Why does CommitGen need an API key?

Currently, CommitGen uses OpenAI's GPT-5-nano model to understand your code changes. This model is hosted by OpenAI and requires authentication.

**Future versions will support:**
- Free local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio)
- Model selection (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, etc.)

---

### How much does it cost?

With GPT-5-nano, approximately **$0.001 to $0.01 per commit** depending on diff size. For most developers:
- 100 commits/month = ~$0.10 - $1.00
- Set usage limits in your OpenAI dashboard to control costs

GPT-5-nano is optimized for speed and cost-effectiveness.

---

### Can I use other AI providers?

Not yet, but it's planned! Future versions will support:
- Anthropic Claude
- Google Gemini
- Local models (Ollama, LM Studio)
- Azure OpenAI

---

### Is my code sent to OpenAI?

Only the **git diff** is sent - showing what changed in your staged files. Your full codebase, git history, and credentials are never transmitted.

---

### What if I don't have internet?

CommitGen requires an internet connection to contact OpenAI's API. Local LLM support (which works offline) is planned for v0.2.0.

---

### Can I customize the commit format?

Not yet, but custom templates are planned for v0.3.0. Currently, CommitGen follows standard Conventional Commits format.

---

### Does CommitGen work with GitLab/Bitbucket?

Yes! CommitGen works with any Git repository, regardless of where it's hosted (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, self-hosted, etc.).
