# 🗺️ AgentOps Cockpit Roadmap: The Path to 10K Stars

Our mission is to become the **Industry Standard Logic Layer** for production AI agents. This roadmap outlines the strategic features and community milestones required to reach 10,000 GitHub stars.

## 🎯 Phase 1: The Foundation (Quarter 1) - "The Hardened Agent"
*Focus: Security, Governance, and Basic Optimization.*
- [x] **Red Team Auditor**: Automated adversarial testing (now supports Cantonese & Spanish).
- [x] **PII Scrubber**: Enterprise-grade data privacy middleware.
- [x] **Evidence Packer**: Grounded reasoning and source transparency.
- [x] **Load Tester**: Concurrency-based performance validation.
- [x] **Quality Hill Climber**: Iterative prompt quality baselining.
- [x] **One-Click GitHub Action**: A plug-and-play `.yml` to audit any agent repo on every PR.
- [ ] **Agent Hub**: A registry of pre-built "Well-Architected" agent templates.

## 🚀 Phase 2: Intelligence & Scale (Quarter 2) - "Optimal Operations"
*Focus: Cost-reduction and high-fidelity reasoning.*
- [x] **Audit-to-Action (Auto-Fix)**: Direct code injection of production best-practices via CLI.
- [x] **FinOps Savings Projection**: Dollar-amount financial forecasting for token optimization.
- [x] **Triple-State Situational Analysis**: Version-aware optimization for Legacy vs Modern SDKs.
- [x] **Agent "Cockpit Score"**: A single grade (A-F) for production-readiness based on Well-Architected principles.
- [x] **Multi-Agent Orchestrator & Conflict Guard**: Support for Swarm patterns with cross-framework stability checks.
- [ ] **VPC-Native Hive Mind**: Managed semantic caching for AlloyDB and Memorystore.
- [ ] **Dynamic Model Routing**: Automatic switching between Flash and Pro based on prompt complexity and budget.

## 🎭 Phase 3: The Ecosystem (Quarter 3) - "Widespread Adoption"
*Focus: Interoperability and community growth.*
- [x] **Framework Connectors**: Governed audits for LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, and CopilotKit.
- [x] **Native MCP Server Export**: Launch the Cockpit as a Model Context Protocol server.
- [ ] **Visual "Mission Control" UI**: Real-time log streaming and token usage graphs in a cinematic dashboard.
- [ ] **GCP Marketplace Integration**: Deploy the Cockpit as a managed service on Google Cloud.
- [ ] **Plugin System**: Community-contributed tools and auditors.

## 🧠 Phase 4: Autonomous Resilience (Quarter 4) - "The Sentient Service"
*Focus: AIOps, Self-healing, and Global Scaling.*
- [ ] **Self-Healing Reasoning**: Detect 'Logic Loops' and autonomously branch to 'Safe Mode' recovery paths.
- [ ] **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Dynamic throttling of sub-agents based on budget velocity and provider health.
- [ ] **Federated Hive Mind**: Encrypted, multi-region semantic cache synchronization for distributed swarms.
- [ ] **AIOps Control Tower**: Enterprise-grade management for thousands of concurrent, autonomous agent sessions.

## 💎 Phase 5: The Agentic Economy (Year 2) - "Universal Orchestration"
*Focus: A2A Commerce, Identity, and Industry Dominance.*
- [ ] **A2A Metering & Settlement**: Standardized protocol for agents to trade services and tokens via secure ledger.
- [ ] **Verifiable Agent Identity (vDID)**: Decentralized credentials for agents to hold independent system permissions.
- [ ] **Cross-Cloud Governance**: Apply 'Well-Architected' audits across GCP, AWS, and Azure from a single Cockpit.
- [ ] **The 100K Star Milestone**: Community plugin marketplace and the standardized "Agentic AI Engineer" certification.
