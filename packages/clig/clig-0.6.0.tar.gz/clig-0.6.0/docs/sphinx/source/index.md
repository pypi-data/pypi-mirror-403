# `clig` - CLI Generator

`clig` is a single module, written in pure python, that wraps around the
_stdlib_ module [`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) to
generate command line interfaces through simple functions.

If you know how to use
[`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html), you may want to
use `clig`.

## Installation

pip install clig
