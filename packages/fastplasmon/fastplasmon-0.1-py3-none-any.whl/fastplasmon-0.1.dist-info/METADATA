## Overview

**fastplasmon** is a Python library for ultrafast dipolar electrostatic modeling of plasmonic nanoparticles with arbitrary geometry.

This method assumes that the surface charge density can be expanded as a series of multipole moments:

$$
\sigma(\mathbf{s}) =
\sigma_{\text{monopole}}(\mathbf{s}) +
\sigma_{\text{dipole}}(\mathbf{s}) +
\sigma_{\text{quadrupole}}(\mathbf{s}) + \cdots
$$


and **retains only the dipole component**


For strongly retarded regimes or higher-order multipolar effects, full-wave solvers (e.g., BEM, FEM, DDA) remain necessary.

This package currently supports single plasmonic nanoparticles composed of a single material embedded in a homogeneous medium, allowing the calculation of:

- LSPR spectra
- Geometry-only extraction of dipolar Neumann–Poincaré (K) eigenvalues
- Near-field mapping
- Efficient refractive-index sensitivity and biosensing analysis

## Core Features

* Support for arbitrary triangulated nanoparticle meshes
* Calculation of surface charge density
* Geometry-only extraction of intrinsic dipolar eigenvalues  $\kappa_n \in (-1/2, 1/2)$
* Polarizibility tensor extraction
* Spectral response: Extinction, scattering, and absorption cross sections
* Inclusion of Modified Long-Wavelength Approximation (MLWA) for weak retardation (ka<0.7)
* Near-field evaluation: Field decay profiles for conformal dielectric coatings and effective refractive-index modeling for biosensing layers
* Computation time scales with $O(N^2)$ for matrix assembly, however, runtime is nearly independent of the number of wavelengths


## Algorithmic Highlights

The key algorithmic ideas implemented in *fastplasmon* are:

* **Dipole-subspace operator projection**  
  The K operator is projected onto the basis $\{x(s), y(s), z(s)\}$, yielding a 3×3 generalized eigenproblem.

* **Matrix-free K application**  
  The K operator is applied directly to the dipole basis using Numba-accelerated kernels, avoiding dense matrix storage.

* **Symmetrized reduced operators**  
  Discrete self-adjointness is enforced at the reduced level, ensuring physically admissible eigenvalues.

* **Separation of geometry and material response**  
  All geometry-dependent quantities are computed once; material dispersion enters only through scalar expressions.



## Installation

From PyPI:

```python
pip install fastplasmon
```
From source:

```python
git clone https://github.com/INESCTEC/fastplasmon.git
cd fastplasmon
pip install -e .
```

## Basic Usage

A minimal workflow:

```python
from fastplasmon import ArbitraryShapeDipolarSolver

solver = ArbitraryShapeDipolarSolver(
    vertices, faces,
    epsilon=eps_metal,
    medium_epsilon=eps_host
)

# Project K operator onto dipole subspace
kappa, R_dip, a_dip, w_dip = solver.projectK_modes()

# Compute polarizability and extinction
Cext = solver.extinction(
    wavelength,
    eps_medium,
    eps_metal
)

```
