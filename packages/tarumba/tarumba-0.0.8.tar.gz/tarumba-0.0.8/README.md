# Tarumba

The universal archive manager.

Tarumba is a frontend for multiple archive managers. It aims to provide a
simple unified interface to manage all your archives. Tarumba is also a Python
library for archive manager integration.

Tarumba cannot handle any archives by itself. Instead, it uses the archive
managers available on the system. See the list of supported backends below.
