**ObliviousPy-HSS** is a Python library implementing **Homomorphic Secret Sharing (HSS)** constructions applied to **Oblivious Linear Evaluation (OLE)**, **Vector-OLE (V-OLE)**, and **n×OLE** generation, with a particular focus on *silent* and *pre-computation–based* correlation generation.

The library accompanies and implements the constructions presented in the following research paper.

## 🧾 Abstract

We analyzed in depth the Homomorphic Secret Sharing construction applied for Pseudorandom Correlation Function, and we obtained interesting results for various applications.

In this paper, we discuss how the PCF can be achieved using the Damgård–Jurik HSS schema by solving the distance function over a ciphertext parametric space of (\mathbb{Z}^*_{n^{\xi+1}}), performing the distributed multiplication protocol as the base building block for our PCF.

We created a weak PCF for Vector-OLE via 1-depth HSS circuit; furthermore, via what we called pre-computation with RO-less, we achieved a strong PCF for V-OLE between two parties correct against an honest-but-curious adversary (\mathcal{A}*{hbc}) and fail-safe secure against an active adversary (\mathcal{A}*{poly}).

We also extended our main construction by describing a silent approach in two different ways: a semi-silent variant based on a pre-sampling assumption between the parties, and a true-silent protocol execution exploiting the generation of seeds by a PRF.

As a final step, we discuss how to build an (n \times \text{OLE}) generator via our pre-computation session to craft an arbitrary amount of OLE correlation.

Our entire paper is further verified by the implementation of a complete and exhaustive library covering all HSS operations, publicly accessible and usable via `pip install obliviouspy-HSS` and importing `import oblivious`.

## 🧑‍💻 Quick Start

After installation, simply import the library in Python:

```python
import oblivious
```

The package exposes the core primitives and utilities required to construct and experiment with HSS-based circuits, following the designs described in the paper.

## 📓 Examples & Notebooks

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the main use cases:

* **V-OLE generation** using HSS-based PCF constructions
* **n×OLE generation** via a pre-computation phase, showing how to craft an arbitrary amount of OLE correlations

These notebooks are intended both as executable examples and as a companion to the theoretical constructions presented in the paper.
