Welcome to Model Metrics! Model Metrics is a versatile Python 
library designed to streamline the evaluation and interpretation of machine 
learning models. It provides a robust framework for generating predictions, 
computing model metrics, analyzing feature importance, and visualizing results. 
Whether you're working with SHAP values, model coefficients, confusion matrices, 
ROC curves, precision-recall plots, and other key performance indicators.
