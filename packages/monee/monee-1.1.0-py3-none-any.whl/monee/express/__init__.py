        name (str, optional): Human-readable name for the bus for easier identification.

    Adds a gas-to-heat conversion unit to the network, connecting specified gas and heat nodes with defined operational parameters.

    This function is used to model the conversion of gas energy into heat within an energy network, such as in district heating systems or industrial processes requiring gas-fired heating. Use it during network setup or expansion to represent gas boilers or similar equipment. The function creates a gas-to-heat unit with user-defined heat output, efficiency, and physical characteristics, then connects it to the appropriate gas supply, heat delivery, and heat return nodes. Optional constraints and external temperature settings can be applied to tailor the unit's operation and ensure compliance with system requirements.

    Args:
        network (mm.Network): The network to which the gas-to-heat conversion unit will be added. Must be a valid `mm.Network` instance.
        gas_node_id: Identifier of the gas node supplying fuel to the conversion unit.
        heat_node_id: Identifier of the heat node receiving the converted heat energy.
        heat_return_node_id: Identifier of the heat return node for the heating circuit.
        heat_energy_w (float): Amount of heat energy produced by the unit, in watts.
        diameter_m (float): Diameter of the conversion unit in meters, influencing capacity and efficiency.
        efficiency (float): Conversion efficiency (0 < value ≤ 1), representing the ratio of heat output to gas input.
        temperature_ext_k (float, optional): External temperature in Kelvin, affecting conversion performance. Defaults to 293.
        constraints (dict or object, optional): Operational constraints for the unit, such as output or efficiency limits.

    Returns:
        mm.GasToHeat: The created gas-to-heat conversion unit object, already integrated into the network and connected to the specified nodes.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the network is invalid, node identifiers are missing or incorrect, or if parameter values are out of valid ranges or incompatible.

    Examples:
        Add a gas-to-heat conversion unit with specific energy output and efficiency:
            g2h_unit = create_g2h(
                my_network,
                gas_node_id=1,

                heat_return_node_id=3,
                heat_energy_w=5000,
                diameter_m=0.3,
                efficiency=0.85
            )

        Add a unit with custom external temperature and operational constraints:
            g2h_unit = create_g2h(
                my_network,
                gas_node_id='GAS1',
