class Node(Component):

    Represents a node in the network, managing connectivity, child components, and node-specific attributes.

    The Node class extends Component to provide functionality for managing network nodes, including tracking incoming and outgoing branches, associated child components, and node-specific constraints or metadata. Nodes serve as connection points for branches and can represent buses, junctions, or other network entities. Use this class when constructing or modifying network topologies, performing connectivity analysis, or managing nodal attributes in simulation workflows.

    Example:
        node = Node(node_id=1, model=my_node_model, position=(10, 20))
        node.add_from_branch_id((2, 1, 0))
        node.add_to_branch_id((1, 3, 0))
        node.remove_branch((2, 1, 0))

    Parameters:
        node_id: Unique identifier for the node.
        model: The node's associated model object.
        child_ids (list, optional): List of child component IDs attached to the node.
        constraints (list, optional): List of operational constraints for the node.
        grid (optional): The grid or domain to which the node belongs.
        name (str, optional): Human-readable name for the node.
        position (optional): Geographical or logical position of the node.
        active (bool, optional): Whether the node is active in the network. Defaults to True.
        independent (bool, optional): Whether the node is independent in the network. Defaults to True.

    Attributes:
        child_ids (list): IDs of child components attached to the node.
        constraints (list): Operational constraints for the node.
        from_branch_ids (list): Identifiers of incoming branches.
        to_branch_ids (list): Identifiers of outgoing branches.
        position: Geographical or logical position of the node.

    Methods:
        add_from_branch_id(branch_id): Registers a branch as incoming to the node.
        add_to_branch_id(branch_id): Registers a branch as outgoing from the node.
        _remove_branch(branch_id): Removes a branch from incoming or outgoing lists.
        remove_branch(branch_id): Removes both a branch and its reversed counterpart from the node's branch lists.
