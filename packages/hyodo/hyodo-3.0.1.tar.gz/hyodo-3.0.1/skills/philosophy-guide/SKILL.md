# AFO Kingdom Philosophy Guide (眞善美孝永)

The philosophical foundation of AFO Kingdom, guiding all decisions through the wisdom of 5 pillars.

## The 5 Pillars (五柱)

### 眞 (Truth / Jin) - 35%
> "What is technically correct?"

**Application:**
- Code must be type-safe and verifiable
- Claims must be backed by evidence
- Documentation must match implementation

**Questions to Ask:**
- Is this implementation accurate?
- Does it follow established patterns?
- Can this be verified?

**Related Commands:** `/check` (Pyright gate)

---

### 善 (Goodness / Seon) - 35%
> "What is ethically sound?"

**Application:**
- Code must not harm the system or users
- Tests must cover critical paths
- Changes must be reversible

**Questions to Ask:**
- Does this cause harm?
- Is there adequate testing?
- Can we rollback safely?

**Related Commands:** `/check` (pytest gate), `/rollback`

---

### 美 (Beauty / Mi) - 20%
> "What is elegant and clear?"

**Application:**
- Code must be readable and maintainable
- UX must minimize cognitive load
- Error messages must be helpful

**Questions to Ask:**
- Is this code clean?
- Can a new developer understand this?
- Is the user experience smooth?

**Related Commands:** `/check` (Ruff gate)

---

### 孝 (Serenity / Hyo) - 8%
> "What brings peace?"

**Application:**
- Operations should be frictionless
- Users should not be confused
- One-shot execution when possible

**Questions to Ask:**
- Is this low friction?
- Does it reduce cognitive load?
- Can this run without intervention?

**Related Tools:** SixXon CLI Humility Protocol

---

### 永 (Eternity / Yeong) - 2%
> "What endures?"

**Application:**
- Decisions must be documented
- Evidence must be preserved
- Knowledge must be transferable

**Questions to Ask:**
- Is this documented?
- Will future developers understand why?
- Is there an evidence trail?

**Related Commands:** `/evidence`, `/ssot`

## Trinity Score Formula

```
Trinity Score = (眞 × 0.35) + (善 × 0.35) + (美 × 0.20) + (孝 × 0.08) + (永 × 0.02)
```

## Decision Matrix

| Trinity Score | Risk Score | Decision |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| >= 90 | <= 10 | AUTO_RUN |
| 70-89 | 11-30 | ASK_COMMANDER |
| < 70 | > 30 | BLOCK |

## The 3 Strategists

When making decisions, consult the 3 strategists:

| Strategist | Pillar | Role |
|------------|--------|------|
| **장영실** (Jang Yeong-sil) | 眞 | Long-term vision, architecture |
| **이순신** (Yi Sun-sin) | 善 | Risk assessment, stability |
| **신사임당** (Shin Saimdang) | 美 | UX, communication, clarity |

Use `/strategist` to get their perspectives on any decision.

## Daily Practice

1. **Before coding**: Ask "Which pillar does this serve?"
2. **During review**: Evaluate against all 5 pillars
3. **Before commit**: Run `/trinity` to calculate score
4. **After completion**: Record evidence with `/evidence`

## Philosophy in Action

```
[Task Received]
     ↓
[/trinity] → Calculate Score
     ↓
Score >= 90? → AUTO_RUN
     ↓ No
[/strategist] → Get Consensus
     ↓
Consensus? → ASK_COMMANDER
     ↓ No
BLOCK → Improve & Retry
```
