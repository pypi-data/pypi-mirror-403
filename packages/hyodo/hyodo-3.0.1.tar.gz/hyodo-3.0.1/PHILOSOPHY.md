Hyodo Philosophy and AFO Pillars

Phase: 87B Alignment and OSS Readiness

Pillars (AFO Foundation):
- Truth (眞): Technical accuracy, verifiability, reproducibility
- Goodness (善): Security, ethics, risk management
- Beauty (美): Clarity, maintainability, elegant design
- Serenity (孝): Reliability, stability, low cognitive load
- Eternity (永): Long-term sustainability, auditable history

Guiding Principles for Hyodo OSS:
- All changes and governance decisions should reflect the five pillars.
- Trinity Score concept should be adapted to Hyodo for governance decisions (weighting, tracking, dashboards).
- Documentation and evidence should be preserved in a transparent, auditable manner.
- Open collaboration should be designed to respect security, licensing, and governance constraints.

Note: This file will be extended as the OSS process evolves and as Hyodo moves toward public release.
