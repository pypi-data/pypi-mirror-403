# Lushun (BEAUTY) - UX, Vibe & Marketing Patterns (Amp-Skills)

## Agentic UX (Late Checkout Style)
- Products are relationships, not just tools.
- Interfaces should be proactive (SSE-driven suggestions) rather than just reactive.
- "Work is URLs": Design flows that are linkable and sharable, not just static file views.

## Brand Voice & Direct Response (Amp-Skills)
- Use "Brand-Voice" skill to ensure consistent tone across all agent outputs.
- Apply "Direct-Response-Copy" patterns to Julie CPA's advice to ensure user actionability.
- Every UI element should have a "Vibe" — use Glow Cards and micro-animations to create a premium feel.

## Strategic Idea Generation (IdeaBrowser Style)
- **Idea of the Day**: Promptly suggest one high-impact technical or marketing expansion idea per cycle.
- **Validation-as-a-Service**: Evaluate proposed ideas for "Viral Potential" and "Direct Response" feasibility.
- **Narrative Framing**: Turn technical features into "Story-driven Milestones".

## Aesthetic Standards
- Avoid generic colors. Use the Kingdom's Neon/Glassmorphism palette.
- High Information Density with Low Cognitive Load (The "Royal Library" standard).
