# Zilong (TRUTH) - Technical & Development Patterns (Amp-Skills)

## Compound Engineering (Plan → Work → Review)
- Define the technical arc before writing a single line of code.
- Break features into atomic, verifiable units (The "Atomic Strategy").
- Every iteration must include a review phase that updates the project metadata.

## Ralph Pattern (Autonomous Loop)
- Use `prd.json` as a single source of truth for task state.
- Each iteration starts with a clean context, relying on serialized state.
- Log tactical learnings in `AGENTS.md` to prevent regressive errors.
