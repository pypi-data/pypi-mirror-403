class CUDAProperties:
    """
    CUDA-specific device properties for capability-based kernel selection.

    This class defines CUDA compute capability constraints for kernel selection, allowing kernels to specify
    minimum and maximum CUDA compute capabilities they support.

    Args:
        min_capability (`int`):
            Minimum CUDA compute capability required (e.g., 75 for compute capability 7.5).
        max_capability (`int`):
            Maximum CUDA compute capability supported (e.g., 90 for compute capability 9.0).

    Example:
        ```python
        from kernels import CUDAProperties, Device

        # Define CUDA properties for modern GPUs (compute capability 7.5 to 9.0)
        cuda_props = CUDAProperties(min_capability=75, max_capability=90)

        # Create a device with these properties
        device = Device(type="cuda", properties=cuda_props)
        ```

    Note:
        CUDA compute capabilities are represented as integers where the major and minor versions are concatenated.
        For example, compute capability 7.5 is represented as 75, and 8.6 is represented as 86.
