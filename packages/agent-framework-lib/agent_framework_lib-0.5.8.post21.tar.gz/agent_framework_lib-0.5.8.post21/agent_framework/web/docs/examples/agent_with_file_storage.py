File Storage Agent Example

This example demonstrates how to create an agent with file storage capabilities and automatic memory management.
The agent can store, retrieve, and manage files while maintaining conversation context across sessions.

Features demonstrated:
- File upload and storage with automatic processing
- File retrieval and listing with memory context
- PDF generation from Markdown content with multiple template styles
- Automatic file processing and markdown conversion
- Integration with the Agent Framework's file storage system
- Conversation memory that includes file interactions
- Reusable tools architecture with dependency injection
- Agent tags and image URL for visual metadata

Usage:
    uv run agent_with_file_storage.py

The agent will start a web server on http://localhost:8101
Try uploading files and discussing them, then reload - the agent remembers your file interactions!

Requirements: uv add agent-framework[llamaindex]
