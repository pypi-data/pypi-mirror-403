# coreason-connect

**The secure execution gateway for the CoReason ecosystem.**

coreason-connect transforms the CoReason "Brain" (coreason-cortex) from a passive text generator into an active **Agentic Workforce**. It solves the "Last Mile" problem of Enterprise AI by securely executing actions (RPC) on behalf of specific human users.

> **v0.3.0 Update**: Now functions as a standalone **MCP Gateway Microservice** with SSE support.

## Installation

```bash
pip install coreason-connect
```

*Note: For dependency management, we recommend using a virtual environment or tools like Poetry.*

## Features

*   **MCP-First Architecture**: Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) as the universal interface for forward compatibility with any Agentic Framework.
*   **Dynamic Plugin Loading**: Supports a "Glass Box" architecture where plugins are hot-loaded from local paths, ensuring isolation and security.
*   **Delegated Identity**: Uses RFC 8693 patterns to exchange workload identity for specific user tokens, preserving the Chain of Custody in audit logs.
*   **Transactional Safety**: Includes a "Spend Gate" that automatically suspends `is_consequential: true` actions (like purchases) until human approval is granted.
*   **Extensible Modules**: Built-in support and examples for:
    *   **Scientific Operations**: Searching and purchasing literature (e.g., RightFind).
    *   **Productivity**: Managing Microsoft 365 calendar and emails.
    *   **DevOps**: Self-healing code via GitOps workflows.

For detailed requirements and architecture, see [Product Requirements](docs/product_requirements.md).

## Usage

For detailed setup, see [Usage Guide](docs/usage.md).

### Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v $(pwd)/connectors.yaml:/app/connectors.yaml \
  coreason-connect:latest
```

The service exposes:
*   `GET /sse`: Server-Sent Events endpoint for MCP connection.
*   `POST /messages`: JSON-RPC message endpoint.
*   `GET /health`: Service health check.
