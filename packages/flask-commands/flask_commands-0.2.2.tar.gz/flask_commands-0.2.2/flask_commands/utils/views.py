def view_make_file(destination_file_path: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Create a new view file containing a simple HTML snippet with a randomly
    selected, Python-themed quote.

    The function builds a minimal HTML fragment (`<div>...</div>`) and writes it
    to the given destination path using `write_file`. If a file already exists
    at that path, a styled warning message is returned instead of overwriting
    the file. Any other unexpected exceptions are also caught and returned as a
    styled error message.

    Parameters:
        destination_file_path (str) : The full path (including filename) where the view file should be created.

    Returns:
        Tuple[bool, str]: A tuple containing:
            - bool: True indicating the route was successfully added.
            - str: A formatted message with success notification and usage instructions.
    Example:
        >>> is_successful, message = view_make_file(
        ...     route_name='users.index')
