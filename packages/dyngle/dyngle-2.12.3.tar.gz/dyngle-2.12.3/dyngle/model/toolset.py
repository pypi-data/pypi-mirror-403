    """Represents the entire set of definitions for operations, expressions,

    The Dyngleverse acts as a registry/index for all operations and global
    constants (constants and expressions). It maintains:

    - operations: A dict of Operation objects indexed by name
    - global_constants: A Context containing global constants and expressions

    When operations are created, they receive a reference to global_constants
    and merge them with their own local constants, establishing the proper
    scoping hierarchy:

    1. Global constants (lowest precedence)
    2. Local operation constants (higher precedence)
    3. Live data from execution (highest precedence, shared across operations)
