"""Base classes and infrastructure for repository implementations.

This package provides the foundational classes and utilities for building
repository implementations in the cmem_client library. It includes:

- Abstract base classes defining repository interfaces
- Configuration classes for different repository types
- Concrete implementations for common data access patterns

Repositories abstract the details of API communication and provide a
consistent, dictionary-like interface for accessing Corporate Memory resources.
