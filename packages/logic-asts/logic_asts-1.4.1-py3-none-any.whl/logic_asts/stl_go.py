r"""Abstract syntax trees for signal temporal logic with graph operators.

This module extends linear temporal logic with graph operators for specifying
properties of multi-agent systems over communication or interaction graphs.
Signal Temporal Logic with Graph Operators (STL-GO) allows quantification over
edges in graphs with weight and count constraints.

Core Graph Operators:
    - GraphIncoming: $\text{In}^{(W,\\#)}_\text{(G,E)} \phi$ - incoming edges
    - GraphOutgoing: $\text{Out}^{(W,\\#)}_\text{(G,E)} \psi$ - outgoing edges

Constraints on Graph Operators:
    Operators are parameterized by:
    - Graph types G (set of graph identifiers, e.g., {c, s, m})
    - Weight interval W: edge weights must fall in [w1, w2]
    - Edge count interval E: number of edges must be in [e1, e2]
    - Quantifier over graph types: exists or forall

Key Classes:
    - WeightInterval: Constraint on edge weights [w1, w2]
    - EdgeCountInterval: Constraint on edge counts [e1, e2]
    - Quantifier: Enum for existential/universal quantification
    - GraphIncoming: Incoming edge operator
    - GraphOutgoing: Outgoing edge operator

Integration with Temporal Logic:
    Graph operators can be nested with LTL operators (X, F, G, U) to specify
    temporal properties of multi-agent communication patterns.

Examples:
    - Incoming agreement: in^[0,1]{E}_{c}[1,n] consensus
    - Outgoing broadcast: G out^[1,inf]{A}_{s}[1,n] message
    - Temporal-graph: F in^[0.5,1]{E}_{c,s}[1,3] active

    Examples:
        - Bounded positive: WeightInterval(0.5, 2.5)  represents [0.5, 2.5]
