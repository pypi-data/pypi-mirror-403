1. INTRODUCTION
  - Acknowledge receipt of the paperwork (LOC/LOA/LOR)
  - State the date and subject matter clearly
  - Express intent to respond professionally
------------------------------------------------------>
I received the Letter of Counseling dated {{DD Month YYYY}} regarding {{my late arrival to formation on DD Month YYYY}}. I respectfully submit this response for your consideration.

<!-----------------------------------------------------
2. RESPONSE TO ALLEGATIONS
  Address each allegation with specific facts and supporting evidence.
  - If contesting: provide what actually occurred (dates, times, witnesses), identify factual inaccuracies, reference supporting documentation
  - If accepting: acknowledge professionally, provide context without excuses, demonstrate this is not part of a pattern
  - If procedural issues exist: cite specific regulatory violations with AFI references and timeline
------------------------------------------------------>
I accept responsibility for my tardiness and sincerely apologize for failing to meet expected standards. While I experienced an unforeseen vehicle malfunction that morning, I recognize I should have implemented contingency planning to prevent this occurrence.

<!-----------------------------------------------------
3. SERVICE HISTORY
  Demonstrate sustained value to the Air Force mission.
  - Years of service, AFSC, current duties
  - EPR ratings with specific quoted language from assessments
  - Decorations, deployments, and significant accomplishments
------------------------------------------------------>
I respectfully request consideration of my overall service record. As a Cyber Transport technician with four years of active service, I completed technical training with honors and received the "Must Promote" statement on my most recent EPR. I have been recognized as Airman of the Quarter (3rd Quarter, 2024) and received the Air Force Achievement Medal (December 2024) for outstanding contributions to cyber infrastructure modernization.

<!-----------------------------------------------------
4. MITIGATION AND REHABILITATION
  Demonstrate concrete corrective actions implemented since the incident.
  - Specific remedial measures with implementation dates and quantifiable outcomes
  - Additional training completed, procedural improvements, performance metrics
------------------------------------------------------>
I have taken immediate corrective action to prevent recurrence. I have adjusted my departure routine to arrive 30 minutes prior to scheduled formations and established a preventive vehicle maintenance schedule with documented monthly inspections. I have maintained perfect attendance with zero tardiness incidents in the 45 days following this event.

<!-----------------------------------------------------
5. CLOSING
  Request withdrawal or non-filing in Personnel Information File (PIF).
  - Articulate potential career impacts (promotion eligibility, security clearance, reenlistment)
  - Reaffirm commitment to Air Force standards and continued service excellence
------------------------------------------------------>
Based on my sustained performance record and the comprehensive corrective actions implemented, I respectfully request for this letter to not be filed in my Personnel Information File. Filing could adversely impact my promotion eligibility and future career opportunities. This isolated incident does not accurately reflect my dedication to the Air Force or my commitment to upholding the highest standards of conduct and professionalism. I am determined to continue serving with distinction and contributing meaningfully to the mission. Thank you for your consideration.
