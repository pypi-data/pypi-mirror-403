"""
This algorithm proposes a new paradigm in language model architecture, aiming to revolutionize natural language processing through direct weights adjustment and automatic parameter configuration.
The Hur-Model is a development module that implements this concept, enabling the training, retraining, tuning, and inference of language models in a groundbreaking way.
It reduces dependence on backpropagation through an initial weight adjustment using a HurNet network and accelerates model parameterization through optimization calculations and self-configuration.
This code was architected, developed, and programmed by Ben-Hur Varriano for Sapiens Technology®️.
Any use, modification, disclosure, or public commentary without prior authorization from Sapiens Technology®️ will be subject to legal action by our legal team.
