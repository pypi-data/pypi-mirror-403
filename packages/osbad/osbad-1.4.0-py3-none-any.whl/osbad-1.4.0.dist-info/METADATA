# Open-Source Benchmark of Anomaly Detection (OSBAD)

Welcome to the Open-Source Benchmark of Anomaly Detection (OSBAD) repository,
a unified, reproducible framework for evaluating the performance of various
statistical, distance-based, and machine learning methods in detecting
anomalies for chemical and material science applications. With the growing
reliance on data-driven analysis in fields ranging from battery,
catalysis and polymers to alloys and nanomaterials, the ability to detect
anomalies reliably and efficiently is crucial for discovery, safety and
performance optimization.


## What Are Anomalies?

Anomalies are observations in data that deviate significantly from expected or
typical patterns. For example, in the context of battery systems, anomalies
may signal degradation, faults, or unsafe conditions and can indicate issues
like overheating, capacity fade, or internal short circuits.

We consider two primary types of anomalies:

   - **Point anomalies**: A single data point that is significantly different
     from the rest. Example: A sudden change in the voltage, current or
     temperature measurement for battery systems or a sudden spike in
     temperature during a reaction or an outlying measurement in
     spectroscopic data.

   - **Collective anomalies**: A sequence or group of data points that, when
     considered together, are anomalous, even if each point appears normal in
     isolation. Example: A continuous series of abnormal voltage measurement
     across a window that diverges from expected discharge behavior or a
     time series of abnormal stress-strain measurements in a mechanical
     test that diverges from expected material deformation behavior.


## Why Is Anomaly Detection Important?

Chemical and material systems are critical in applications such as
energy storage, catalysis, electronics, structural design, and
biomedical devices. Anomaly detection plays a vital role in:

- **Research efficiency**: Identifying irregular experimental data points for
  faster analysis and reproducibility.
- **Material discovery**: Detecting rare but valuable events that could
  indicate new material properties.
- **Process safety**: Early detection of unsafe conditions
  (e.g., thermal runaway in battery operations).
- **Preventive maintenance**: Identifying degradation or failure modes before
  performance drops.
- **Regulatory compliance**: Ensuring that processes and produced materials
  meet consistency and performance standards.

Robust anomaly detection helps improve reliability, accelerate innovation,
and ensure safety across a wide range of chemical and material applications.


## Methods Included in This Benchmark

This benchmark includes a broad spectrum of approaches grouped into three
categories:

### Statistical Methods
- Standard Deviation
- Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)
- Interquartile Range (IQR)
- Z-score
- Modified Z-score

### Distance-Based Metrics
- Euclidean Distance
- Manhattan Distance
- Minkowski Distance
- Mahalanobis Distance

### Machine Learning Approaches
- Isolation Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Autoencoders (AE)

Each method is applied and tested on curated benchmarking datasets to assess
its suitability and effectiveness.


## Evaluation Metrics

This benchmark evaluates each method using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the anomaly detector
- **Precision**: Proportion of detected anomalies that are truly anomalous
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual anomalies that were correctly detected
- **F1-score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**: A balanced measure that handles
imbalanced datasets by evaluating true positives, true negatives, false
positives and false negatives,

These metrics help ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison across different
detection techniques.
