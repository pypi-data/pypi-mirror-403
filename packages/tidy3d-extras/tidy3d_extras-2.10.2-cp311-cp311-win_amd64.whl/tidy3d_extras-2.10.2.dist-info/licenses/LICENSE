(i) Equitable Relief. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by Licensee of any of its obligations under Section 2(b), would cause Licensor irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, Licensor will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy.
