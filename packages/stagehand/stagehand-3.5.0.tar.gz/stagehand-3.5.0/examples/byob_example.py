"""
Example showing how to bring your own browser driver while still using Stagehand.

This script runs Playwright locally to drive the browser and uses Stagehand to
plan the interactions (observe → extract) without having Stagehand own the page.

Required environment variables:
- BROWSERBASE_API_KEY
- BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID
- MODEL_API_KEY

Usage:

```
pip install playwright stagehand
# (if Playwright is new) playwright install chromium
uv run python examples/byob_example.py
```
