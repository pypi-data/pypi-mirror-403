Release History
===============

2.0.7
-----
* Documentation improvements.
* Add `microfs` as an additional command-line entry point.

2.0.6
-----
* Add missing short options for commands.

2.0.5
-----
* **API CHANGE**: `MicroBitSerial.flush` override method is removed
* `MicroBitSerial.open` and `MicroBitSerial.close`
  now call `raw_on` and `raw_off` respectively.

2.0.4
-----
* Add `micropython_version` function to get the version of MicroPython.
* Add `--micropython` option for `version` command.
* Better command-line help messages.

2.0.3
-----
* Fix type hint for timeout parameter in `MicroBitSerial.__init__`
  and `MicroBitSerial.get_serial`.

2.0.2
-----
* Simplify file reading and writing operations.
* Support for specifying a directory as the target in the `get` command.

2.0.1
-----
* Fix exit code when an unknown error occurs. Now exits with code 1.

2.0.0
-----

* When reading a file, byte strings can use single and double quotes.
* The module is changed to be a package.
* Support for `--timeout` command line parameter.
  The default value of timeout is adjusted to 10.
* Support for `--version` flag.
* Support for `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, `du`, and `version` subcommands.
* **API CHANGE**: New `MicroBitSerial` class to manage serial connections.
  Related functions have become methods of this class.
* **API CHANGE**: Functions now accept `MicroBitSerial` instances instead
  of raw `serial.Serial` objects.
* **API CHANGE**: Functions are not accepting None as a serial argument.
  A `MicroBitSerial` instance must be provided.
  Use `MicroBitSerial.get_serial()` to get a serial connection
  of the detected micro:bit.
* **API CHANGE**: The order of function arguments has changed.
* **API CHANGE**: The `find_microbit` function now returns the port
  (previously returned a tuple of (port string, serial number)).
* **API CHANGE**: Exception handling is now more granular. Introduced
  `MicroBitError`, `MicroBitIOError`, and `MicroBitNotFoundError` for
  micro:bit-specific errors, replacing generic `IOError` usage.
* **API CHANGE**: The `ls`, `rm`, `put`, and `get` functions now return None
  instead of True.
* **API CHANGE**: The `put` and `get` functions now use `pathlib.Path` objects
  for local file arguments (`filename` and `target`), instead of plain strings.
* **API CHANGE**: The `execute` function now returns only the stdout bytes
  (previously returned a tuple of (stdout, stderr)). Errors are now raised as
  exceptions instead of being returned.
* **API CHANGE**: The `put` and `get` command-line interfaces now require
  `pathlib.Path` objects for file arguments.
* ... See the file docstring and function docstrings for more details.

-----

* Updated version of PySerial used by the script.
* Non-zero exit codes when things go wrong.
* Execute as ``__main__``.
* Black formatting updates.
* Thanks to @carlosperate for these updates.

1.4.4
-----

* New feature. Thanks to @makinteract, it is possible to add an optional

1.4.3
-----

* Bug fix. See commentary in issue #22. Thanks again to alexandros769.

1.4.2
-----

* Update getting of data from micro:bit device to deal with control characters

1.4.1
-----

* Clamp PySerial version to use with microfs to a version known to work.

* Fix bug in version parsing that was mangling the ``machine`` attribute.

1.3.0
-----

* Added a new function (not available via the command line) to get the version
  of MicroPython on the device.
* **API CHANGE** The find_microbit function now returns a tuple with position 0
  as the port and position 1 as the serial number of the connected device.

1.2.3
-----

* Extensive debugging and a fix by Carlos Pereira Atencio to ensure that serial
  connections are opened, closed and made ready for microfs related commands in
