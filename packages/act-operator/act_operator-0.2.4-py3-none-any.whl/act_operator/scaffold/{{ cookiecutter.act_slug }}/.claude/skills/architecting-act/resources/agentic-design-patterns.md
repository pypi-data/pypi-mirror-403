# Agentic Design Patterns

Guide for Step 1a: Determine if AI Agent is needed, and select appropriate Agentic Pattern.

## When to Consider Agentic Patterns

**First, assess if the workflow requires AI agent capabilities:**

| Indicator | Example | → Agentic Pattern |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Autonomous decision-making | Route queries to appropriate handler | Coordinator |
| Tool/API access | Query databases, call external APIs | Single-Agent |
| Iterative reasoning | Refine output until quality threshold | Iterative Refinement |
| Self-correction | Detect and fix errors autonomously | ReAct, Loop |
| Human oversight needed | High-stakes decisions, compliance | Human-in-the-Loop |
| Multiple specialized roles | Generator + Critic, Researcher + Writer | Multi-Agent |

**Skip Agentic Patterns when:**
- Simple data transformation (CSV→JSON)
- Fixed, deterministic workflows
- No external interactions needed
- All logic expressible as explicit rules

---

## Pattern Catalog

### 1. Single-Agent System

**Structure:** One AI model + tools + system prompt

```mermaid
graph LR
    START([START]) --> A["AgentNode(tools=[tool1, tool2, ...])"]
    A --> END([END])
```

**Use when:**
- Moderate complexity tasks
- Early-stage development
- Tool count < 10

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Simple to implement and debug
- ❌ Performance degrades with many tools
- ❌ Complex tasks may need decomposition

**Example:** Customer support agent with order lookup, FAQ retrieval tools

---

### 2. Multi-Agent Systems

#### 2a. Sequential Pattern

**Structure:** Agent1 → Agent2 → Agent3 → END

```mermaid
graph LR
    START([START]) --> A[DataCollectorNode]
    A --> B[AnalyzerNode]
    B --> C[ReportWriterNode]
    C --> END([END])
```

**Use when:**
- Rigid, ordered pipeline
- Each step depends on previous output
- No dynamic routing needed

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Predictable, low orchestration cost
- ❌ Inflexible, cannot skip steps
- ❌ Poor for dynamic conditions

---

#### 2b. Parallel Pattern

**Structure:** [Agent1, Agent2, Agent3] execute simultaneously → Synthesize

```mermaid
graph LR
    START([START]) --> A[SentimentNode] & B[KeywordNode] & C[CategoryNode]
    A & B & C --> D[SynthesizerNode]
    D --> END([END])
```

**Use when:**
- Independent tasks executable concurrently
- Gathering diverse perspectives
- Reducing overall latency

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Reduced latency through concurrency
- ❌ Higher resource/cost utilization
- ❌ Complex synthesis for conflicting results

---

#### 2c. Loop Pattern

**Structure:** Process → Evaluate → (Refine ↺ | Complete)

```mermaid
graph LR
    START([START]) --> A[GeneratorNode]
    A --> B[EvaluatorNode]
    B -->|needs_refinement| A
    B -->|complete| END([END])
```

**Use when:**
- Iterative refinement tasks
- Quality threshold must be met
- Self-correction workflows

**Design notes:**
- Set max iterations (3-10)
- Define clear exit conditions
- Track progress per iteration

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Enables iterative improvement
- ❌ Risk of infinite loops
- ❌ Unpredictable latency

---

#### 2d. Review and Critique Pattern

**Structure:** Generator → Critic → (Revise ↺ | Approve)

```mermaid
graph LR
    START([START]) --> A[GeneratorNode]
    A --> B[CriticNode]
    B -->|rejected| A
    B -->|approved| END([END])
```

**Use when:**
- High accuracy requirements
- Strict formatting/constraint compliance
- Code generation with security review
- Sensitive document validation

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Improved output quality
- ✅ Dedicated verification step
- ❌ Additional latency from review
- ❌ Revision loops accumulate costs

---

#### 2e. Iterative Refinement Pattern

**Structure:** Cycle with session state across multiple iterations

```mermaid
graph LR
    START([START]) --> A[GeneratorNode]
    A --> B[CriticNode]
    B --> C{MeetsThreshold}
    C -->|no| D[RefineWithFeedbackNode]
    D --> A
    C -->|yes| END([END])
```

**Use when:**
- Complex generation difficult in single step
- Code writing and debugging
- Multi-part planning
- Long-form document drafting

**Key difference from Loop:** Maintains rich session state across cycles, stores improvement history

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Produces highly polished outputs
- ❌ Direct cost/latency increase per cycle
- ❌ Requires sophisticated exit conditions

---

#### 2f. Coordinator Pattern

**Structure:** Central AI analyzes → dispatches to specialists

```mermaid
graph LR
    START([START]) --> A[CoordinatorNode]
    A -->|order_query| B[OrderAgentNode]
    B --> A
    A -->|returns| C[ReturnsAgentNode]
    C --> A
    A -->|faq| D[FAQAgentNode]
    D --> A
    A --> END([END])
```

**Use when:**
- Varied input types needing flexible routing
- Structured business process automation
- Adaptive routing requirements

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Flexible, handles diverse inputs
- ✅ Runtime adaptation capability
- ❌ Multiple model calls increase costs
- ❌ Higher latency than direct routing

---

#### 2g. Hierarchical Task Decomposition Pattern

**Structure:** Root agent decomposes → delegates to sub-agents

```mermaid
graph LR
    START([START]) --> A[RootAgentNode]
    A --> B[SubAgentsNode]
    B --> C[SubSubAgentsNode]
    C --> D[SynthesizerNode]
    D --> END([END])
```

**Use when:**
- Complex, ambiguous, open-ended problems
- Multi-step research and planning
- Problems requiring extensive decomposition
- Quality more important than speed

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Handles highly complex problems
- ✅ Comprehensive, high-quality results
- ❌ High architectural complexity
- ❌ Difficult to debug and maintain
- ❌ Significantly increased latency/costs

---

#### 2h. Swarm Pattern

**Structure:** All-to-all collaboration, iterative debate

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Swarm["Collaborative Debate"]
        A[Agent1Node] <--> B[Agent2Node]
        B <--> C[Agent3Node]
        C <--> A
    end
```

**Use when:**
- Highly complex, ambiguous problems
- Solutions benefit from debate/refinement
- Consensus-building requirements
- Creative problem-solving

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Simulates collaborative expert team
- ✅ Exceptionally creative solutions
- ❌ Most complex and costly pattern
- ❌ Risk of unproductive loops
- ❌ May fail to converge

---

### 3. ReAct (Reason and Act) Pattern

**Structure:** Thought → Action → Observation loop

```mermaid
graph LR
    START([START]) --> A[ReasonNode]
    A --> B[SelectActionNode]
    B --> C[ExecuteActionNode]
    C --> D{IsFinalAnswer}
    D -->|no| A
    D -->|yes| END([END])
```

**Use when:**
- Complex, dynamic tasks requiring continuous planning
- Adaptive approach based on new observations
- Robotics, pathfinding, navigation
- Real-time environmental constraints

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Transparent reasoning (aids debugging)
- ✅ Dynamic adaptation to new information
- ❌ Higher latency from multi-step iteration
- ❌ Effectiveness depends on model quality
- ❌ Errors propagate through observations

---

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop Pattern

**Structure:** Agent workflow with predefined human checkpoints

```mermaid
graph LR
    START([START]) --> A[AutoProcessNode]
    A --> B{HumanCheckpoint}
    B -->|approved| C[ContinueProcessNode]
    C --> END([END])
    B -->|rejected| A
    B -.- D[HumanReviewerNode]
```

**Use when:**
- High-stakes decisions
- Safety-critical operations
- Subjective judgment requirements
- Compliance and validation needs
- Escalation after agent failure

**Implementation:**
- Define clear checkpoint criteria
- Build approval/rejection UI
- Handle timeout scenarios
- Log human decisions

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Improves safety and reliability
- ✅ Adds human judgment at critical points
- ❌ Requires external interaction system
- ❌ Adds latency from human waiting
- ❌ Scaling challenges with multiple approvals

---

### 5. Custom Logic Pattern

**Structure:** Code-based orchestration with complex branching

```mermaid
graph LR
    START([START]) --> A{ConditionA}
    A -->|yes| B[AgentANode]
    B --> C{ConfidenceCheck}
    C -->|high| D[HandleResultNode]
    C -->|low| E[AgentBNode]
    E --> F[MergeResultsNode]
    A -->|no:fallback| G[FallbackAgentNode]
    D --> END([END])
    F --> END([END])
    G --> END([END])
```

**Use when:**
- Complex branching beyond linear sequences
- Mixing predefined rules with model reasoning
- Fine-grained process control
- Workflows not fitting standard templates

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Maximum control over execution
- ✅ Accommodates unique business logic
- ❌ Increases development complexity
- ❌ More error-prone than patterns
- ❌ Requires extensive testing

---

## Combining Patterns

**Common pattern combinations:**

| Primary Pattern | + Secondary Pattern | Use Case |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------|
| Coordinator | + Human-in-the-Loop | Routing with escalation checkpoints |
| Iterative Refinement | + Human-in-the-Loop | Quality cycles with human fallback |
| Sequential | + Human-in-the-Loop | Pipeline with approval gates |
| Coordinator | + Review & Critique | Routing with output validation |

**Design approach for combinations:**
1. Identify primary workflow pattern
2. Overlay secondary pattern at specific checkpoints
3. Define clear transition criteria between patterns

---

## Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent Decision

| Criterion | Single-Agent | Multi-Agent |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Tool count | < 10 tools | > 10 tools or specialized domains |
| Task complexity | One domain, moderate complexity | Multiple domains, high complexity |
| Routing needs | Static, predictable | Dynamic, input-dependent |
| Development stage | Early/prototyping | Production, proven requirements |

**Start with Single-Agent** unless clear indicators for Multi-Agent exist.
