# Create EM Simulation model from GDSII layout files

setupEM provides a graphical user interface (Qt based) to configured gds2palace workflow.
gds2palace enables an RFIC FEM simulation workflow based on the Palace FEM solver by AWS.

# Installation
To install the setupEM, activate the venv where you want to install.

Documentation for the gds2palace workflow assumes that you have created a Python venv 
named "palace" in ~/venv/palace and installed the modules there.

If you follow this, you would first activate the venv: 
```
    source ~\venv\palace\bin\activate
```
and then install setupEM and dependencies via PyPI: 
```
    pip install setupEM    
```

To upgrade to the latest version, do 
```
    pip install setupEM --upgrade   
```


## Missing libraries on installation
If you see this error message when trying to run setupEM:

```
qt.qpa.plugin: From 6.5.0, xcb-cursor0 or libxcb-cursor0 is needed to load the Qt xcb platform plugin. qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "" even though it was found.
```

you need to install additional Qt libraries:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-xkb1 libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-randr0 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-render0 libxcb-shape0 libxcb-shm0 libxcb-sync1 libxcb-xfixes0 libxcb-xinput0 libxcb-xv0 libxcb-util1 libxkbcommon-x11-0
```
