## 🗺️ Overview

[Infernal](https://eddylab.org/infernal) is a biological sequence analysis method that uses profile stochastic 
context-free grammars called *covariance models* (CMs) to identify RNA structure and sequence similarities. 
Infernal was developed by [Eric P. Nawrocki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jn84-g0AAAAJ&hl=fr) 
during his PhD thesis in the [Eddy Laboratory](http://eddylab.org/).

`pyinfernal` is a Python package, implemented using the [Cython](https://cython.org/)
language, that provides bindings to Infernal. It directly interacts with the
Infernal internals. It builds on top of [`pyhmmer`](https://github.com/althonos/pyhmmer)
and follows a generally similar interface.

*This library is still very experimental and has not been thoroughly tested yet, use with caution*.

## 🔧 Installing

`pyinfernal` can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyinfernal/),
which hosts some pre-built CPython wheels for Linux and MacOS on x86-64 and Arm64, as well as the code required to compile from source with Cython:
```console
$ pip install pyinfernal
```

Compilation for UNIX PowerPC is not tested in CI, but should work out of the
box. Note than non-UNIX operating systems (such as Windows) are not
supported by Infernal.

## 🔖 Citation

PyInfernal is scientific software, and builds on top of Infernal. Please cite
the [Infernal 1.1 application note](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/22/2933/316439) 
in Bioinformatics, for instance:

> PyInfernal, a Python library binding to Infernal (Nawrocki & Eddy, 2013).

<!-- ## 📖 Documentation

A complete [API reference](https://pyinfernal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/) can
be found in the [online documentation](https://pyinfernal.readthedocs.io/), or
directly from the command line using
[`pydoc`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pydoc.html):
```console
$ pydoc pyinfernal.cm
$ pydoc pyinfernal.infernal
``` -->

## 💡 Example

Use `pyinfernal` to run `cmsearch` to search for the genome of 
*Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655* ([U00096.3](www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/U00096.3))
for models from [RFam](https://rfam.org). This will produce an iterable 
over [`TopHits`] that can be used for further sorting/querying in Python. 
Processing happens in parallel using Python threads, 
and a [`TopHits`] object is yielded for every [`CM`] in the input iterable.

[`CM`]: https://pyinfernal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/cm/hmms.html#pyinfernal.plan7.HMM
[`TopHits`]: https://pyinfernal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/cm/results.html#pyinfernal.plan7.TopHits

```python
import pyhmmer.easel
import pyinfernal.cm
import pyinfernal.infernal

rna = pyhmmer.easel.Alphabet.rna()
with pyhmmer.easel.SequenceFile("U00096.3.fna", digital=True, alphabet=rna) as seq_file:
    sequences = seq_file.read_block()

with pyinfernal.cm.CMFile("RFam.cm", alphabet=rna) as cm_file:
    for hits in pyinfernal.cmsearch(cm_file, sequences, cpus=4):
        print(f"CM {hits.query.name} ({hits.query.accession}) found {len(hits)} hits in the target sequences")
```
