/**
 *  \mainpage AMPS C & C++ Client Reference
 *
 *  Welcome to the AMPS C & C++ client API reference.
 *
 *  The AMPS C++ client is a fully-featured client that provides a high
 *  performance, convenient interface for working with AMPS. The AMPS C
 *  client, which the C++ client is built upon, provides a low-level
 *  API for working with AMPS.
 *
 *  These pages provide a detailed API reference. This API reference
 *  is meant to be used with the C/C++ Developer Guide, the
 *  AMPS Command Reference, and the AMPS User Guide. Detailed information on
 *  how to use AMPS and the AMPS Client is provided in the guides and reference.
 *  The API documentation provides information on the implementation details
 *  (for example, the exact function signatures) and general information
 *  to help you quickly remember what a given function does (or what a
 *  given value represents).
 *
 *  The guide is included with the Client distribution, or you can
 *  visit the [C++ developer page](http://www.crankuptheamps.com/documentation/client-apis/cpp/)
 *  on the 60East web site for more details.
 *
 *  Using the C++ client is simple:
 *
 *  ```cpp
 *
 *    #include <iostream>
 *    #include <amps/ampsplusplus.hpp>
 *
 *     int main(void)
 *     {
 *       AMPS::Client amps("myapp"); // Use a unique name for an actual application
 *
 *       try
 *       {
 *
 *         amps.connect("tcp://localhost:9007/amps/json");
 *         amps.logon();
 *
 *         for (auto msg : amps.subscribe("orders",
 *                                        "/symbol LIKE 'ABCD'"))
 *         {
 *
 *            std::cout << msg.getData() << std::endl;
 *
 *         }
 *
 *       } catch (AMPSException &e) {
 *
 *         std::cerr << e.what() << std::endl;
 *
 *         return -1;
 *
 *       }
 *       return 0;
 *     }
 *
 *  ```
 *
 *  In this short sample, you can see the outline of a typical AMPS
 *  application. An application typically:
 *
 *  * Constructs a {@link AMPS::HAClient} or {@link AMPS::Client} object
 *  * Provides connection (and, if necessary, authentication) information to the Client
 *  * Connects and logs on to AMPS
 *
 *  A subscriber then typically:
 *
 *  * Issues one or more commands to AMPS (using the {@link AMPS::Command} object or the named convenience methods)
 *  * Responds to the results returned by AMPS (which are returned as instances of AMPS::Message)
 *
 *  A publisher then typically:
 *
 *  * Registers a callback to receive publish failures
 *  * Retrieves information from an external source
 *  * Formats that information into the message payload, and publishes the message to AMPS (using the {@link AMPS::Client.publish() } function or a {@link AMPS::Command})
 *  * In the event a publish fails, responds appropriately in the callback
 *
 *  Naturally, the outline above is extremely simplified, and ignores the
 *  options available for setting up a {@link AMPS::HAClient} or {@link AMPS::Client}, as well as the
 *  details of working with AMPS. The distribution includes a number of
 *  sample programs that provide simple implementations of common tasks,
 *  and the Developer Guide provides an overview of available options,
 *  common patterns and usage, as well as best practice advice for
 *  design and implementation of applications that use AMPS.
 *
 *  To help with learning, troubleshooting,  and debugging, 60East includes
 *  full source in the Client distribution, available from the
 *  [C++ developer page](http://www.crankuptheamps.com/documentation/client-apis/cpp/)
