The Schedulers module
=====================

This module contains the logic for interacting with schedulers, for example, ``HTCondor``.

The scheduler module provides a unified interface for submitting and managing jobs across different scheduling systems.
Currently supported schedulers include HTCondor, with Slurm support planned for the future.
