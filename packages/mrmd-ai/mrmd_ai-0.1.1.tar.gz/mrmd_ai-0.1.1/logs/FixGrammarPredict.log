Press Shift+Enter to run this cell\nmessage = \"Hello from MRMD!\"\nprint(message)\n```\n\n## Features\n\n### Live Code Execution\n\nWrite Python code in fenced code blocks and execute them inline. Output appears right below:\n\n```python\n# Math expressions\nimport math\nradius = 5\narea = math.pi * radius ** 2\nprint(f\"Circle area: {area:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Rich Output\n\nMRMD supports rich output including plots, dataframes, and more:\n\n```python\n# Create some data\ndata = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49]\nprint(\"Squares:\", data)\n\n# If you have matplotlib installed:\n# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# plt.plot(data)\n# plt.title(\"Square numbers\")\n# plt.show()\n```\n\n### Session Management\n\nYour code runs in an IPython session that persists across cells. Variables defined in one cell are available in others:\n\n```python\n# This uses 'message' from the first cell\nprint(f\"Previous message: {message}\")\nprint(f\"Previous area: {area:.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Package Management\n\nInstall packages using `%pip`:\n\n```python\n# %pip install pandas numpy matplotlib\n# (Uncomment and run to install)\n```\n\n## Navigation\n\n- **Projects tab**: Open or create projects with their own virtual environments\n- **Files tab**: Browse and open markdown files\n- **Variables tab**: Inspect your session variables\n- **Session indicator** (bottom left): Click to switch environments\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n| Shortcut | Action |\n|----------|--------|\n| `Shift+Enter` | Run current code block |\n| `Ctrl+Enter` | Run block, stay in block |\n| `Ctrl+S` | Save file |\n| `Ctrl+P` | Open file browser |\n| `Tab` | Autocomplete |\n| `Shift+Tab` | Show documentation |\n| `Escape` | Exit focus mode |\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Create a project**: Click the Projects tab and create a new project\n2. **Open a file**: Browse to a `.md` file and start editing\n3. **Experiment**: This welcome page is read-only, but your own files are fully editable\n\n---\n\n*MRMD - Where markdown meets execution*\n"}, "outputs": {"fixed_text": "I am using dspy-cli for a super cool project.
