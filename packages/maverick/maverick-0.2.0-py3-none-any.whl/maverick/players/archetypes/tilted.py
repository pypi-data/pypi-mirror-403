    Uses hand strength evaluation but interprets it irrationally. Makes emotionally-

    emotional reasoning rather than sound equity calculations.

    - **Key Traits:** Revenge plays, poor decision-making, irrational use of hand strength.
    - **Strengths:** None while tilted.
    - **Weaknesses:** Severe strategic leaks, misuses equity information.
    - **Common At:** All stakes, especially after big pots.
