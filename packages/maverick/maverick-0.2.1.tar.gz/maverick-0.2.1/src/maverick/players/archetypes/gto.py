    Uses hand strength evaluation to implement balanced, theoretically sound play.
    Makes decisions based on hand equity with consistent bet sizing and balanced ranges.

    - **Key Traits:** Balanced ranges, mixed strategies, uses hand equity for optimal play.
    - **Strengths:** Extremely difficult to exploit, mathematically sound.
    - **Weaknesses:** May underperform in soft, highly exploitative games.
    - **Common At:** Mid-to-high stakes online.
