# lvm_tools

Lightweight wrapper of [LVM DRP](https://github.com/sdss/lvmdrp) data with an emphasis on modularity. Allows for lazy reading via [`dask`](https://www.dask.org), especially useful for fitting large models. Designed for use with spectrospatial models via [`spectracles`](https://github.com/TomHilder/spectracles) but probably useful for other things too.

Feel free to contact me personally if you have any questions at all.

## Installation

Easiest is from PyPI either with `pip`

```sh
pip install lvm-tools
```

or `uv` (recommended)

```sh
uv add lvm-tools
```

Or, you can clone and build from source

```sh
git clone git@github.com:TomHilder/lvm_tools.git
cd lvm_tools
pip install -e .
```
