## 📍 Note

This project is a rewritten version of the original MriduManda, which was developed under another GitHub account of mine in [this](https://github.com/shvedt/mridu-manda.git) repo. That account is no longer accessible, and as a result, the project is being completely rebuilt here from scratch — keeping its original purpose, but with improved clarity, structure, and maintainability.
