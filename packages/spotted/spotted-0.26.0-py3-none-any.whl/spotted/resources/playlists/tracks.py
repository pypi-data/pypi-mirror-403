              to 10.<br/>To reorder the last item in a playlist with 10 items to the start of
              the playlist, set _range_start_ to 9, and _insert_before_ to 0.

          published: The playlist's public/private status (if it should be added to the user's
              profile or not): `true` the playlist will be public, `false` the playlist will
              be private, `null` the playlist status is not relevant. For more about

        Get full details of the items of a playlist owned by a Spotify user.

        Args:
          playlist_id: The [Spotify ID](/documentation/web-api/concepts/spotify-uris-ids) of the
              playlist.

          additional_types: A comma-separated list of item types that your client supports besides the
              default `track` type. Valid types are: `track` and `episode`.<br/> _**Note**:
              This parameter was introduced to allow existing clients to maintain their
              current behaviour and might be deprecated in the future._<br/> In addition to
              providing this parameter, make sure that your client properly handles cases of
              new types in the future by checking against the `type` field of each object.

          fields: Filters for the query: a comma-separated list of the fields to return. If
              omitted, all fields are returned. For example, to get just the total number of
              items and the request limit:<br/>`fields=total,limit`<br/>A dot separator can be
              used to specify non-reoccurring fields, while parentheses can be used to specify
              reoccurring fields within objects. For example, to get just the added date and
              user ID of the adder:<br/>`fields=items(added_at,added_by.id)`<br/>Use multiple
              parentheses to drill down into nested objects, for
              example:<br/>`fields=items(track(name,href,album(name,href)))`<br/>Fields can be
              excluded by prefixing them with an exclamation mark, for
              example:<br/>`fields=items.track.album(!external_urls,images)`

          limit: The maximum number of items to return. Default: 20. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 100.

          market: An
              [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
              If a country code is specified, only content that is available in that market
              will be returned.<br/> If a valid user access token is specified in the request
              header, the country associated with the user account will take priority over
              this parameter.<br/> _**Note**: If neither market or user country are provided,
              the content is considered unavailable for the client._<br/> Users can view the
              country that is associated with their account in the
              [account settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/overview/).

          offset: The index of the first item to return. Default: 0 (the first item). Use with
              limit to get the next set of items.

        Get full details of the items of a playlist owned by a Spotify user.

        Args:
          playlist_id: The [Spotify ID](/documentation/web-api/concepts/spotify-uris-ids) of the
              playlist.

          additional_types: A comma-separated list of item types that your client supports besides the
              default `track` type. Valid types are: `track` and `episode`.<br/> _**Note**:
              This parameter was introduced to allow existing clients to maintain their
              current behaviour and might be deprecated in the future._<br/> In addition to
              providing this parameter, make sure that your client properly handles cases of
              new types in the future by checking against the `type` field of each object.

          fields: Filters for the query: a comma-separated list of the fields to return. If
              omitted, all fields are returned. For example, to get just the total number of
              items and the request limit:<br/>`fields=total,limit`<br/>A dot separator can be
              used to specify non-reoccurring fields, while parentheses can be used to specify
              reoccurring fields within objects. For example, to get just the added date and
              user ID of the adder:<br/>`fields=items(added_at,added_by.id)`<br/>Use multiple
              parentheses to drill down into nested objects, for
              example:<br/>`fields=items(track(name,href,album(name,href)))`<br/>Fields can be
              excluded by prefixing them with an exclamation mark, for
              example:<br/>`fields=items.track.album(!external_urls,images)`

          limit: The maximum number of items to return. Default: 20. Minimum: 1. Maximum: 100.

          market: An
              [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2).
              If a country code is specified, only content that is available in that market
              will be returned.<br/> If a valid user access token is specified in the request
              header, the country associated with the user account will take priority over
              this parameter.<br/> _**Note**: If neither market or user country are provided,
              the content is considered unavailable for the client._<br/> Users can view the
              country that is associated with their account in the
              [account settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/overview/).

          offset: The index of the first item to return. Default: 0 (the first item). Use with
              limit to get the next set of items.
