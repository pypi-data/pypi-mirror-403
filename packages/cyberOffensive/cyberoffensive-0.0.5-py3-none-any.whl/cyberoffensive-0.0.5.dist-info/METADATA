## ⚙️ System-Level Feature Compatibility

Some functions in this package rely on low-level Windows APIs (e.g., input control and elevated operations). These features require administrator privileges and may be restricted by system security policies. On Windows 11, security controls are stricter than on Windows 10, so certain features may not function in Windows 11 or higher.

- Platform detection (Windows / Linux / macOS)
