## installation

```
$ pip install flumine
```

flumine requires Python 3.9+

## setup

Get started...

```python
from flumine import Flumine, BaseStrategy
from betfairlightweight.filters import streaming_market_filter

# Define your strategy here
class ExampleStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def check_market_book(self, market, market_book) -> bool:
        # process_market_book only executed if this returns True
        return True

    def process_market_book(self, market, market_book):
        # Your strategy logic
        pass

# Initialize the framework
framework = Flumine()

# Add your strategy to the framework
framework.add_strategy(
    ExampleStrategy(
        market_filter=streaming_market_filter(
            event_type_ids=["7"],
            country_codes=["GB"],
            market_types=["WIN"],
        )
    )
)

# Start the trading framework
framework.run()
```

Example strategy with logic and order execution:

```python
from flumine import BaseStrategy
from flumine.order.trade import Trade
from flumine.order.order import LimitOrder, OrderStatus
from flumine.markets.market import Market
from betfairlightweight.filters import streaming_market_filter
from betfairlightweight.resources import MarketBook


class ExampleStrategy(BaseStrategy):
    def start(self, flumine) -> None:
        print("starting strategy 'ExampleStrategy'")

    def check_market_book(self, market: Market, market_book: MarketBook) -> bool:
        # process_market_book only executed if this returns True
        if market_book.status != "CLOSED":
            return True

    def process_market_book(self, market: Market, market_book: MarketBook) -> None:
        # process marketBook object
        for runner in market_book.runners:
            if runner.status == "ACTIVE" and runner.last_price_traded < 1.5:
                trade = Trade(
                    market_id=market_book.market_id,
                    selection_id=runner.selection_id,
                    handicap=runner.handicap,
                    strategy=self
                )
                order = trade.create_order(
                    side="LAY",
                    order_type=LimitOrder(price=1.01, size=2.00)
                )
                market.place_order(order)

    def process_orders(self, market: Market, orders: list) -> None:
        for order in orders:
            if order.status == OrderStatus.EXECUTABLE:
                if order.size_remaining == 2.00:
                    market.cancel_order(order, 0.02)  # reduce size to 1.98
                if order.order_type.persistence_type == "LAPSE":
                    market.update_order(order, "PERSIST")
                if order.size_remaining > 0:
                    market.replace_order(order, 1.02)  # move


# Initialize the framework
framework = Flumine()

# Add your strategy to the framework
framework.add_strategy(
    ExampleStrategy(
        market_filter=streaming_market_filter(
            event_type_ids=["7"],
            country_codes=["GB"],
            market_types=["WIN"],
        )
    )
)

# Start the trading framework
framework.run()
```
