# futureEXPERT

_futureEXPERT_ is a flexible Python toolkit designed to significantly simplify the process of building professional forecasting solutions.
It is built upon a **Smart Build** principle: a clear division of tasks that makes powerful forecasting accessible with ease, even without a deep data science background.
* **You focus on the "what"**: Designing the solution tailored to your specific domain and requirements, connecting your data and integrating the results into your workflow.
* **_futureEXPERT_ handles the "how"**: The complex methodological and technical details, from data preparation to forecast generation, are abstracted away for you.


The workflow is handled by four distinct modules:

1. *CHECK-IN*: Prepares your time series data. This module validates, cleans, and transforms your input data to ensure it's ready for forecasting.
2. *POOL*: Provides a library of curated external variables (e.g., economic indicators, weather data). You can search this continuously updated collection to find useful covariates for your forecast.
3. *MATCHER*: Ranks covariates to find the most impactful ones for your data. It takes your own covariates or variables from the *POOL*, determines their optimal time lag, and measures their predictive value against a baseline model.
4. *FORECAST*: Generates the final forecast. This module automatically selects the best model (from statistical, ML, and AI methods) for each time series and can incorporate the top-performing covariates identified by *MATCHER*.

The simplest workflow only contains *CHECK-IN* and *FORECAST* is described in the jupyter notebook [getting started](https://github.com/discovertomorrow/futureexpert/blob/main/notebooks/getting_started.ipynb).

In case you don't want to use this Python client or access futureEXPERT via API, check out our frontend solution [futureNOW](https://www.future-forecasting.de/).

## Registration

If you do not have an account for [future](https://now.future-forecasting.de) yet, click [here](https://launch.future-forecasting.de/) to register for a free account.

## Installation

In order to use futureEXPERT, you need a Python environment with Python 3.9 or higher.

The futureEXPERT package can be directly installed with `pip` from our GitHub repository.

```
pip install -U futureexpert
```

## Getting started

If you want to explore the workflow of futureEXPERT without diving directly into code, check out our [dashboard](https://expert.future-forecasting.de). It visually guides you through the capabilities of the futureEXPERT client. While it does not contain the full capabilities of the library, it offers a hands-on way to experience what futureEXPERT can do.

To get started with futureEXPERT we recommend checking out the jupyter notebook [getting started](https://github.com/discovertomorrow/futureexpert/blob/main/notebooks/getting_started.ipynb) to help you with your first steps. Also check our [quick start video tutorial](https://www.future-forecasting.de/video/getting-started/).
