[Unreleased]
------------

[0.5.0] - 2025-01-24
---------------------

Changed
~~~~~~~

* **Version: single source of truth in pyproject.toml** — Version is now read only from ``pyproject.toml``. Added ``_version.py`` that uses ``importlib.metadata`` when the package is installed, or reads ``pyproject.toml`` when running from source. Removed hardcoded ``__version__`` from ``__init__.py``. CLI and ``depcon.__version__`` both derive from this.
* Release and contributing docs now instruct to update the version only in ``pyproject.toml`` (removed the ``__init__.py`` step).

Fixed
~~~~~

* Addressed Ruff lint findings: B007 (unused loop variables), N806 (lowercase variable in ``except``), SIM102 (nested ``if``s), W293 (trailing blanks in docstrings), N805 (Pydantic ``@field_validator`` ``cls``), B904 (``raise ... from`` in parsers).
