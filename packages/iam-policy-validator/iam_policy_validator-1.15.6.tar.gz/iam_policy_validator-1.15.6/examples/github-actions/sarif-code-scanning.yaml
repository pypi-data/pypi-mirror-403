# Notes:
# - Results will appear in the Security tab under "Code scanning alerts"
# - Each issue will be displayed inline on the affected policy file
# - You can filter alerts by severity, rule type, and status
# - Alerts persist across workflow runs and can be dismissed or resolved
# - SARIF format supports line-level annotations for precise issue location
