        If enabled in cluster mode, a nested Dask LocalCluster is initialized by EOPF inside the RSPY Dask Gateway.
        The Dask Gateway should be set with a single worker, else we face unexpected behaviour. The EOPF LocalCluster
        will run inside this single worker.

        If enabled in local mode, the RSPY Dask Gateway is not used. We use only the EOPF LocalCluster. Your local mode
        should use the docker image ghcr.io/rs-python/dask-gateway-server/eopf/localcluster and not
        ghcr.io/rs-python/rs-dpr-service because it contains both the rs-dpr-service and the processor source code
