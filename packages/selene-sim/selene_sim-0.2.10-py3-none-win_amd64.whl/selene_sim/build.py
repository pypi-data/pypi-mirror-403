    Build an selene runner from a supported input resource type, e.g.
    a hugr package, LLVM file, etc. The type of this input is determined
    by matching against registered artifact kinds in the build planner.

    The build planner is used to determine a sequence of steps to transform
    the input resource into a selene executable. These are then performed,
    and the selene executable is returned wrapped in a SeleneInstance instance.

    Args:
        src: The input resource representing a hybrid program.
        name: The stem of the output executable filename, and referred
              to in temporary paths created in the process. If None
              (default), a random name is used.
        build_dir: The directory in which to establish the directory structure
                   for building and running the selene instance. Defaults to
                   a temporary directory.
        build_method: Where applicable, the method used to build the selene
                      executable. Defaults to BuildMethod.VIA_LLVM_BITCODE.
        interface: The quantum interface to target. This defaults to the
                   Helios QIS.
        utilities: A list of utility plugins to use. These are linked in with
                   the final program to expose additional symbols to the user
                   program.
        verbose: If True, the build process will be more verbose.
        planner: The build planner to use. If None, the default global planner
                 is used. For more information, see the selene_core.build_utils
                 documentation.
        progress_bar: If True, a progress bar will be displayed during the
                      build process. This requires tqdm to be installed.
        strict: If True, intermediate artifacts will be validated against their kinds
                on each step. This is more expensive, and is only recommended when
                debugging or developing new artifact kinds and build steps.
    Returns:
        An SeleneInstance object representing the built selene runner
