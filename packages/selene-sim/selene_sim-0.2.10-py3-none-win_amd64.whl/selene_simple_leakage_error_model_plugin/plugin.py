class SimpleLeakagePlugin(ErrorModel):
    """
    A plugin for simulating a simple leakage model. On any 1qb gate, a qubit
    may leak to an auxiliary state with a probability of `p_leak`. On any 2qb
    gate, each qubit may leak to an auxiliary state with a probability of `p_leak`.
    If either qubit in a 2qb gate leaks, the other qubit is then leaked.
    Attributes:
        p_leak (float): The probability of leakage after any operation. Must be
            between 0 and 1 (inclusive).
        leak_measurement_bias (float): The probability of measuring a leaked qubit
            as 1.
