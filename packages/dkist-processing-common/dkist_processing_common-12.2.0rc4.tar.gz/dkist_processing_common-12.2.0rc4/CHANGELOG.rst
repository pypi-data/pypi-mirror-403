v12.1.0 (2026-01-26)
====================

Features
--------

- Add `ListStem` base class for huge speedup in cases where the keys don't matter and the `getter` logic only depends on the
  list of values computed by `setter`. This is the case for most (all?) "Buds". (`#282 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/282>`__)
- Add `SetStem` base class that has all the benefits of `ListStem` but also gets a speedup by storing values in a `set` for
  cases where repeated values don't need to be tracked. (`#282 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/282>`__)
- Speed up parsing of the `*CadenceBud`, `TaskDateBeginBud`, and `[Task]NearFloatBud` by basing these buds on `ListStem`. (`#284 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/284>`__)
- Speed up `NumCSStepBud`, `[Task]UniqueBud`, `[Task]ContributingIdsBud`, and `TaskRoundTimeBudBase` parsing by basing
  these buds on `SetStem`. (`#285 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/285>`__)
- Speed up `CSStepFlower` parsing by using an internal set to keep track of the unique `CSStep` objects. This removes the
  need to compute the unique set when computing the tag for each file. (`#286 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/286>`__)


Misc
----

- Speed up the reading of INPUT files in Parse tasks by turning off image decompression and checksum checks. (`#280 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/280>`__)
- Update `RetarderNameBud` to drop "clear" values (i.e., the retarder is out of the beam) in the `setter` instead of the `getter`.
  This brings it in line with standard Bud-practice. (`#285 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/285>`__)
- Convert the TimeLookupBud to be a SetStem constant. (`#287 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/287>`__)


v12.0.0 (2026-01-22)
====================

Misc
----

- Upgrade dkist-processing-core to 7.0.0 which includes an upgrade of Airflow to 3.1.5 and python >= 3.13. (`#278 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/278>`__)


v11.9.3 (2026-01-07)
====================

Features
--------

- Add TimeLookupBud, which makes a dictionary that maps values of a time metadata key to values of another metadata key.
  Values of the time metadata key are rounded to avoid jitter.  Also add TaskTimeLookupBud, which makes the dictionary
  only for frames of a particular task type. (`#281 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/281>`__)
- Add a constant for dark number of frames per FPA.  The constant returns a dictionary of exposure times as keys
  and a list of number of frames per FPA as values. (`#281 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/281>`__)


Misc
----

- Fix error message when an unexpected number of movie files are found for transfer. (`#279 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/279>`__)


v11.9.2 (2025-12-18)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Raise an error when no movie files are found for transfer to the object store. (`#273 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/273>`__)


v11.9.1 (2025-12-08)
====================

Features
--------

- Store quality data in object store. (`#276 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/276>`__)


v11.9.0 (2025-12-03)
====================

Misc
----

- Upgrade to the globus 4.x SDK. (`#274 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/274>`__)
- Use a pool of direction aware globus accounts for transfers to mitigate contention between simultaneous inbound (TransferL0Data) and/or outbound (TransferL1Data) transfers. (`#274 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/274>`__)
- Integrate dkist-processing-core 6.0.1 which adds additional attributes to metrics and tracing to facilitate discoverability and analysis. (`#275 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/275>`__)


v11.8.1 (2025-12-02)
====================

Misc
----

- Bump minimum version of `pydantic` to 2.7.2 to avoid install failures for python versions >= 3.12. (`#271 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/271>`__)
- Move `solar-wavelength-calibration` dep to 2.0.0 and make use of new helper properties in that release. (`#271 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/271>`__)


v11.8.0 (2025-11-03)
====================

Features
--------

- Update `dkist-processing-common` to use `dkist-inventory` >= v1.11.1 in order to add parameters and their associated values relevant to a particular processing pipeline run to the metadata ASDF file generated in trial workflows. (`#245 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/245>`__)


v11.7.0 (2025-10-09)
====================

Features
--------

- Add new buds to parsing for what will become the dataset extras. (`#267 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/267>`__)
- Add new bud type TaskContributingIdsBud, based on ContributingIdsBud, for for specific task types. (`#267 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/267>`__)
- Add new bud types TaskAverageBud and TaskBeginDateBud, which is based on new TaskDatetimeBudBase. (`#267 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/267>`__)


Removals
--------

- Remove IdBud, which is just a TaskUniqueBud with the task set to observe, and therefore is not needed. (`#267 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/267>`__)
- Remove the `_set_metadata_key_value` method from FitsAccessBase.  Instead of using `setattr`, attributes
  are assigned explicitly in access classes using `MetadataKey` members in place of header key strings. (`#267 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/267>`__)


Misc
----

- Rename TimeFlowerBase and TaskTimeBudBase to RoundTimeFlowerBase and TaskRoundTimeBudBase, respectively. (`#267 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/267>`__)


v11.6.0 (2025-09-26)
====================

Misc
----

- Integrate dkist-processing-core 6.0.0 which brings a swap of Elastic APM to OpenTelemetry for metrics and tracing. (`#268 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/268>`__)
- Added common meters to instrument reads/writes and a framework for observing task progress. (`#268 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/268>`__)


v11.5.1 (2025-09-17)
====================

Misc
----

- Update the redis SDK to the latest version to deploy concurrently with an updated redis server. (`#269 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/269>`__)


v11.5.0 (2025-09-08)
====================

Misc
----

- Update dkist-processing-core to 5.2.0 which includes upgrades to airflow 2.11.0 and requires Python 3.12+. (`#266 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/266>`__)


v11.4.0 (2025-09-04)
====================

Features
--------

- Create new MetadataKey string enum class.  Replace usages like `metadata_key="keyword_name"`
  with `metadata_key=MetadataKey.keyword_name`.  Note that unlike other enum classes, we are using
  the name, not the value. Stem bases now check if they are passed a MetadataKey, and take
  the name as the required string. (`#265 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/265>`__)
- Add `_set_metadata_key_value` method to FitsAccessBase that takes a StrEnum and sets
  a class attribute.  The attribute name is the StrEnum name and the attribute value
  gets the header value with the StrEnum value as key. (`#265 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/265>`__)


Misc
----

- Change classes that inherit from `str` and `Enum` to inherit `StrEnum` instead: BudName, StemName, TaskName.  Convert
  strings to class members where relevant. (`#265 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/265>`__)


v11.3.0 (2025-08-30)
====================

Misc
----

- Split out writing L1 frame timing headers so that their calculation can be separately defined by instruments, as required. (`#263 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/263>`__)
- Update pre-commit hook versions and replace python-reorder-imports with isort. (`#264 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/264>`__)


v11.2.1 (2025-08-12)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Add `multi_plot_data` to quality creation mutation when submitting quality report data. (`#262 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/262>`__)


Misc
----

- Explicitly set color and ordering of lines in wavecal metric plots.
  This gets around issues with order not being preserved in the quality database. (`#262 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/262>`__)
- Update database name for vertical multi-pane plot metric data. It's now called "multi_plot_data". (`#262 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/262>`__)


v11.2.0 (2025-07-18)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Move the writing of spectral line keys in L1 data to later in the process, after the instruments have had a chance to rewrite the WCS info. (`#252 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/252>`__)


v11.1.0 (2025-07-15)
====================

Misc
----

- The graphql and input dataset models are now set to validate whenever attributes are assigned, including after instantiation. (`#255 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/255>`__)
- Create a factory for custom `FakeGQLClient` used in tests.  The factory and associated default returns live in a
  new `mock_metadata_store.py` module in the tests directory.  `FakeGQLClient` is now a test fixture and does not need to
  be imported in tests. (`#255 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/255>`__)
- Fix a Pydantic warning in the graphql model.  Because we validate the `RecipeRunConfiguration` as a JSON dictionary and
  convert it to a model after validation, we need a serializer so Pydantic knows what to expect back out. (`#258 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/258>`__)


v11.0.1 (2025-07-10)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Ignore NaN and Inf values when storing the quality results of a wavelength calibration fit. (`#260 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/260>`__)


Misc
----

- Removing usages of `pkg_resources`, which is on track to be deprecated. (`#254 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/254>`__)


v11.0.0 (2025-07-02)
====================

Features
--------

- Move `location_of_dkist` from the `WriteL1` task to its own module (`~dkist_processing_common.models.dkist_location`).
  Also make it a constant variable instead of a function. (`#256 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/256>`__)
- `Stems` that only match a specific task types can now check against a list of task types.
  This replaces the `ip_task_type` kwarg with `ip_task_types` (which can still be a single string, if desired.) (`#257 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/257>`__)
- Add ability to store and build a quality metric showing the results of wavelength calibration. (`#259 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/259>`__)


v10.9.0 (2025-06-02)
====================

Features
--------

- Add two new codecs:  Basemodel codecs are used for encoding and decoding Pydantic BaseModel objects.  For decoding, the intended model
  is passed to the decoder through a keyword argument in the task read method.  Array codecs are used for encoding and decoding numpy
  arrays similar to the standard np.load() and np.save(), but with the task tag-based write method. (`#235 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/235>`__)


Misc
----

- Remove the input_dataset mixin and replace it with input_dataset Pydantic BaseModel models. (`#235 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/235>`__)
- Change the behavior of ParameterBase such that it takes the task scratch as an argument to provide access to the
  parameter document and parameters that are files.  This behavior replaces the input dataset mixin parameter read method. (`#235 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/235>`__)


v10.8.3 (2025-05-28)
====================

Features
--------

- Further constrain when the ATMOS_R0 header key is written in L1 data based on the following metrics:

  * the ATMOS_R0 value in the L0 data must be less than or equal to 30cm
  * the AO_LOCK value in the L0 data must be True
  * the OOBSHIFT value in the L0 data must be less than 100

  The wavefront sensor has about 1500 subapertures from which x and y shifts are measured. When the adaptive optics loop is locked, we count how many of these shifts exceed a threshold considered to be out of bounds. The r0 measurement gets less accurate as more of these shifts are out of bounds and so this is another way to detect outliers in the r0 value. (`#250 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/250>`__)


v10.8.2 (2025-05-27)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Prevent the `WAVEBAND` key from being populated with a spectral line that falls outside the wavelength bounds of the data. (`#251 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/251>`__)


v10.8.1 (2025-05-22)
====================

Misc
----

- Update `dkist-processing-core` to v5.1.1. (`#253 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/253>`__)


v10.8.0 (2025-05-15)
====================

Features
--------

--------

- Modify usage of CompImageHeader to support astropy 7. (`#222 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/222>`__)


v10.7.2 (2025-04-21)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug in which the AO_LOCK header key is assumed to exist.  The AO_LOCK header key is optional. (`#249 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/249>`__)


v10.7.1 (2025-04-17)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug exposed by updates in the `dkist-inventory` package that did not manage HISTORY or COMMENT cards correctly. (`#248 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/248>`__)


v10.7.0 (2025-04-14)
====================

Features
--------

- New data percentiles are added to the headers to make the range symmetric. (`#242 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/242>`__)
- L1 headers are now created by removing only the keys listed in SPEC-122 as opposed to removing all keys not present in SPEC-214. In addition, any SPEC-214 keys marked as `level0_only` are removed. This will allow spurious header keys to be discovered more easily. (`#246 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/246>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- Header keys that write the percentiles of the data are now correctly named (from DATA<pp> to DATAP<pp>). (`#242 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/242>`__)


Misc
----

- Prevent header keys from being included if they are not a part of the Level 1 SPEC-0214 specification. (`#242 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/242>`__)
- Add missing build dependency specifications. (`#247 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/247>`__)


v10.6.4 (2025-03-31)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Allow input dataset IDs to be conditionally written into the L1 data headers. (`#243 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/243>`__)


v10.6.3 (2025-03-27)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug where transfer input dataset fails if any of the input dataset part documents are missing. (`#241 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/241>`__)
- Pydantic model validator now returns the validated instance. (`#240 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/240>`__)

v10.6.2 (2025-03-19)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix a bug in manual processing where a metadata store dataclass has been previously converted to
  a Pydantic BaseModel.  Add a test that will catch future similar bugs. (`#239 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/239>`__)


Misc
----

- Add coverage badge to README.rst. (`#238 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/238>`__)


v10.6.1 (2025-03-14)
====================

Misc
----

- Convert dataclasses in the graphql model to Pydantic BaseModels for additional validation. In the
  RecipeRunResponse class, configuration is converted from a JSON dictionary to its own Pydantic BaseModel.
  In the InputDatasetPartResponse class, the inputDatasetPartDocument is now returned as a list of dictionaries. (`#236 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/236>`__)
- Change returns from the metadata store queries into Pydantic BaseModel instances.  Remove unnecessary parsing
  and error checking in the metadata store mixin. (`#236 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/236>`__)


v10.6.0 (2025-03-03)
====================

Features
--------

- Add the `RetarderNameBud` that can parse the name of the GOS retarder and ensure that only a single retarder was used
  for the given set of POLCAL input data. (`#235 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/235>`__)


v10.5.15 (2025-02-24)
=====================

Misc
----

v10.5.13 (2025-02-14)
=====================

Misc
----

- Bump version of `dkist-processing-core` to 5.0.0; automated processing workers will now use the "frozen" pip extra of
  instrument pipelines to ensure a constant environment for a given version of that pipeline. (`#233 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/233>`__)


v10.5.12 (2025-02-12)
=====================

Features
--------

- Compute datasetId using sqids rather than hashids.  The minimum datasetId length is now 6 characters. (`#231 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/231>`__)


v10.5.11 (2025-02-06)
=====================

Misc

====================

Bugfixes
--------

- Constrain asdf < 4.0.0


v10.5.0 (2024-11-20)

- Modify the asdf decoder to manage a breaking change in the asdf API. (`#219 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/219>`__)


v10.4.0 (2024-11-14)
====================

Misc
----

- Functions that build the list of items to transfer for a trial outflow are now based on lists of tags
  instead of configuration switches. (`#218 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/218>`__)
- Refactor `TranferTrialDataBase` from an inherited base class to a standalone class
  and rename it `TransferTrialData`. (`#218 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/218>`__)


v10.3.0 (2024-10-15)
====================

Features
--------

- Update the machinery in `quality_store_polcal_results` to handle NaN values.
  This is required for the new error-handling paradigm in `dkist-processing-pac` v3.1.0. (`#214 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/214>`__)
- Add new argument, `num_points_to_sample`, to `quality_store_polcal_results`, which allows a user to reduce the number of points saved for inclusion in the quality report.
  This allows us to mitigate large quality metrics. (`#215 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/215>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- Correctly clean up tags used for file name uniqueness. (`#217 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/217>`__)

====================

Misc
----

- Switch from setup.cfg to pyproject.toml for build configuration (`#214 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/214>`__)
- Make and publish wheels at code push in build pipeline (`#214 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/214>`__)


v10.2.1 (2024-09-27)
====================

Misc
----

- Upgrade to dkist-processing-core 4.2.1 which patches a bug causing the doc builds to fail. (`#213 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/213>`__)


v10.2.0 (2024-09-27)
====================

Misc
----

- Upgrade dkist-processing-core to 4.2.0 which includes the upgrade of airflow to 2.10.2. (`#212 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/212>`__)


v10.1.0 (2024-09-26)
====================

Features
--------

- Adding the `NearFloatBud` and `TaskNearFloatBud` for use in parsing, for when numeric values in a given header should be within a given range. (`#207 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/207>`__)


v10.0.1 (2024-09-24)
====================

Bugfixes
--------

- "FRAMEVOL" key in L1 headers now correctly reports the on-disk size (in MB) of each file. (`#211 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/211>`__)


Misc
----

- Add test coverage for the interservice bus mixin (`#209 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/209>`__)


v10.0.0 (2024-09-23)
====================

Features
--------

- Remove usage of `self.tags` from `WriteL1` task. This greatly improves database usage. It is a breaking change because
  OUTPUT files will no longer share extra tags with their corresponding CALIBRATED files and as a result any downstream
  tasks that depend on richer tags on OUTPUT files will need to swap to using CALIBRATED files instead. (`#210 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/210>`__)


v9.1.0 (2024-09-10)
===================

Misc
----

- Accommodate changes to the GraphQL API associated with refactoring the quality database (`#208 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/208>`__)


v9.0.0 (2024-08-20)
===================

Features
--------

- Greatly improve performance of `QualityL0Metrics` task by eliminating calls to tag database to determine the TASK type
  of *every* file. Instead we now explicitly loop over the TASKs we want and read only those files. (`#205 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/205>`__)
- Allow language in polcal metrics to support binning schemes that aren't 2 dimensional.
  For example, we can now have "...spanning 4 spatial bins." or "...spanning 2 spectral, 4 spatial, and 5 mosaic bins.".
  Any dimensionality is supported (except zero). (`#206 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/206>`__)


v8.2.2 (2024-07-25)
===================

Misc
----

- Rewrite to eliminate warnings in unit tests. (`#203 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/203>`__)


v8.2.1 (2024-07-12)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix bug that accumulated workflow task tags on files written to scratch if the tags passed in were a list and were reused for multiple writes. (`#202 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/202>`__)


v8.2.0 (2024-07-10)
===================

Misc
----

- Make private methods public when we want them to show up in the ReadTheDocs documentation. (`#201 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/201>`__)


v8.1.0 (2024-07-01)
===================

Misc
----

- Update the instructions for development to include the dependency on redis. (`#200 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/200>`__)


v8.0.0 (2024-06-20)
===================

Features
--------

- Default behavior of `ParameterBase._find_most_recent_past_value` is to use `obs_ip_start_time` as the date. Previously
  the default had been `datetime.now()`. An implication of this is that *all* users of `ParameterBase` should instantiate
  their parameters object with `obs_ip_start_time`. The one exception is parameters needed for parsing, which should
  explicitly pass `datetime.now()` to the `start_date` kwarg of `_find_most_recent_past_value`. (`#198 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/198>`__)
- Add the `ParameterArmIdMixin` for defining parameters that depend on the value of an arm ID constant. (`#199 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/199>`__)
- A method to `ParameterBase` (`_load_param_value_from_fits`) for loading file parameters saved as FITS files. (`#199 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/199>`__)
- Add method to `ParameterBase` (`_load_param_value_from_numpy_save`) for loading file parameters saved as numpy save files. (`#199 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/199>`__)


v7.0.0 (2024-06-03)
===================

Misc
----

- Update `sphinx-auotapi` pin to only exclude the breaking version. The bug was fixed in subsequent versions. (`#195 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/195>`__)
- Resolve matplotlib version conflict (`#196 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/196>`__)
- Upgrade dkist-processing-core to support airflow to 2.9.1 which includes the dependency on pydantic 2 and consequently a few other libraries that needed upgrading for the same pydantic 2 dependency. (`#197 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/197>`__)


v6.2.4 (2024-05-20)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- No longer crash when building polcal metrics where some CS steps had `I_sys` fixed during the polcal fit. (`#193 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/193>`__)


Misc
----

- Change the DKIST site time zone to US/Hawaii to correctly account for daylight savings time. (`#192 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/192>`__)
- Pin `sphinx-autoapi` to avoid failure in doc build. (`#194 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/194>`__)


v6.2.3 (2024-05-09)
===================

Features
--------

- Save all floating point arrays as float32. The extra precision of float64 is not needed, especially when lossy quantization is applied before compression. (`#191 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/191>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- `QualityMixin.avg_noise` is now NaN aware. I.e., it will ignore NaN values when computing the noise. (`#190 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/190>`__)


Misc
----

- Cap the length of browse movies at 60 seconds by default. (`#189 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/189>`__)


v6.2.2 (2024-05-07)
===================

Features
--------

- Add the ability to create a quality report from a trial workflow. (`#185 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/185>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- `QualityL0Metrics.calculate_l0_metrics` now correctly identifies the TASK type. Previously it could have erroneously used the WORKFLOWTASK tag to find the IP TASK TYPE. (`#185 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/185>`__)


v6.2.1 (2024-05-01)
===================

Misc
----

- Update legacy type hinting. (`#188 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/188>`__)


v6.1.2 (2024-04-12)
===================

Misc
----

- Refactor retrieval of input dataset parts to only occur when directly requested. (`#180 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/180>`__)
- Populate MANPROCD header key (which denotes if any steps had manual intervention) in L1 data based upon the provenance records for the run. (`#181 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/181>`__)


v6.1.1 (2024-04-10)
===================

Misc
----

- Audit scratch write/tag before they happen so if a failure occurs during or between write and tag, the rollback feature will still perform an idempotent removal. (`#182 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/182>`__)
- Cache the result of checking if a tag is new for the purposes of auditing tags added by a task. (`#183 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/183>`__)
- Retry connection errors that can occur during a connection to Redis. (`#184 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/184>`__)


v6.1.0 (2024-04-04)
===================

Features
--------

- Implement a common 'rollback' method on all Tasks, and Task specific rollback steps where applicable, to facilitate manual processing and operational fault remediation/recovery. (`#177 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/177>`__)


Misc
----

- Make the scratch inventory (Redis) db count configurable through an environment variable with a default which remains the same as the previously hardcoded value. (`#177 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/177>`__)


v6.0.4 (2024-03-26)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- `FitsAccessBase.from_header` no longer clobbers "NAXISn" (and likely other FITS controlled keys) values from input header. (`#179 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/179>`__)


v6.0.3 (2024-03-05)
===================

Features
--------

- Populate new L1 header keyword `SOLARRAD` in all L1 data with the value of the solar angular radius as seen by an observer located at the DKIST site, in arcseconds. (`#176 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/176>`__)


v6.0.2 (2024-03-04)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- Trial ASDF files no longer contain the absolute scratch path in the filenames. They are now relative to the generated
  ASDF file, which mimics the behavior in non-trial ASDF generation. (`#175 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/175>`__)


Misc
----

- No longer log a warning when no paths are found for a set of tags. (`#174 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/174>`__)


v6.0.1 (2024-02-29)
===================

Features
--------

- Support arbitrarily nested lists of tags for tag database operations. (`#172 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/172>`__)


Bugfixes
--------

- All movies are now forced to have an even number of pixels in each dimension. This is a requirement of the H.264 codec; if the dimensions

Misc
----

- Update object-clerk to 0.1.1 to remove the logging of bytes objects. (`#171 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/171>`__)


v6.0.0 (2024-02-15)
===================

Misc
----

- Allow `fits_array_encoder` to accept a `dict` header (previously header had to be `fits.Header`). (`#165 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/165>`__)
- Completely remove `FitsDataMixin`. Use `self.read` and `self.write` with codecs instead. (`#166 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/166>`__)

v5.0.1 (2024-01-12)
===================

Bugfixes
--------

- Add "STOKES" key to all L1 headers. Non-polarimetric data will always have a value of "I". This matches how data are
  treated in inventory. (`#164 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/164>`__)


Misc
----

- Update `dkist-fits-specifications` and associated (validator, simulator) to use new conditional requiredness framework. (`#164 <https://bitbucket.org/dkistdc/dkist-processing-common/pull-requests/164>`__)
