# gymDSM
gymDSM (Didactically Supercharged Mod): A modified version of OpenAI Gym.

## What is gymDSM?
**gymDSM** is a small Python package that provides **didactically enhanced** (teaching-friendly) variants of classic OpenAI Gym environments.

### MountainCar

At the moment, gymDSM focuses on **MountainCar** with a small (but important) visual modification: the car’s color reflects the **last action** taken:
- `0` (push left)  → red  
- `1` (no push)    → blue  
- `2` (push right) → green  

The goal is to make it easier to understand what an agent is doing while interacting with the environment.

## Installation

The library gymDSM is on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/gymDSM/ "gymDSM page on PyPI").
To install the library, first install `pip` and then use the command `pip install gymDSM`. Alternatively, you can use `pip install gymdsm`. Remember that pip/PyPI treat distribution names case-insensitively.

This project is intended to work with **Gym 0.22**. You can install it with the command `pip install gym==0.22`.

On the other hand, if you want to use `render()`, you need to use the following installation command:

```bash
pip install gymDSM[render]
```

(The command above installs `pygame` as an optional dependency.)


---

## Minimal Working Example (MWE)

### 1) Create the environment using gymDSM.make
This is designed to be easily replaceable with the usual Gym pattern:

```python
import gymDSM as gymDSM

env = gymDSM.make("MountainCar-v0")

obs = env.reset()
done = False

while not done:
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # random policy
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

env.close()
```

### 2) Render (optional)
```python
import gymDSM as gymDSM
import time

env = gymDSM.make("MountainCar-v0")
obs = env.reset()

done = False
while not done:
    env.render()  # requires pygame
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    time.sleep(0.02)

env.close()
```

## Behavior and supported environments

For now, only the gym's [Mountain Car](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/mountain_car.py) environment is supported.

- If you call:
  ```python
  env = gymDSM.make("MountainCar-v0")
  ```
  gymDSM will try to create the gymDSM MountainCar variant (with action-based colors).

- If `env_id` is not supported by gymDSM, or if creating the gymDSM version fails for any reason, `gymDSM.make(...)` falls back to:
  ```python
  gym.make(env_id, ...)
  ```
  using the standard Gym environment.
