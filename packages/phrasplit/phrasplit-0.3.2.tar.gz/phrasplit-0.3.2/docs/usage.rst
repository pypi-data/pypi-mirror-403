Usage Guide
===========

This guide covers how to use phrasplit's Python API for text splitting.

Splitting Sentences
-------------------

The :func:`~phrasplit.split_sentences` function intelligently detects sentence
boundaries. It can use either spaCy's NLP pipeline (high accuracy) or regex-based
splitting (lightweight, no dependencies):

.. code-block:: python

   from phrasplit import split_sentences

   text = "Dr. Smith is here. She has a Ph.D. in Chemistry."
   sentences = split_sentences(text)
   print(sentences)
   # ['Dr. Smith is here.', 'She has a Ph.D. in Chemistry.']

The function correctly handles:

- **Abbreviations**: Mr., Mrs., Dr., Prof., etc.
- **Acronyms**: U.S.A., U.K., etc.
- **Titles**: Ph.D., M.D., etc.
- **URLs**: www.example.com
- **Ellipses**: Text with... ellipses

Example with abbreviations:

.. code-block:: python

   text = "Mr. Brown met Prof. Green. They discussed the U.S.A. case."
   sentences = split_sentences(text)
   # ['Mr. Brown met Prof. Green.', 'They discussed the U.S.A. case.']

Choosing Processing Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

phrasplit automatically detects if spaCy is available and uses the appropriate mode.
You can explicitly control this with the ``use_spacy`` parameter:

.. code-block:: python

   # Automatic detection (default)
   sentences = split_sentences(text)
   # Uses spaCy if available, otherwise falls back to regex

   # Force simple mode (no spaCy required)
   sentences = split_sentences(text, use_spacy=False)
   # Uses regex-based splitting, faster and lightweight

   # Force spaCy mode (will error if spaCy not installed)
   sentences = split_sentences(text, use_spacy=True)
   # Uses spaCy NLP for higher accuracy

**When to use simple mode (use_spacy=False):**

- You don't have spaCy installed
- You need faster processing for simple text
- You want to minimize dependencies and memory usage
- Your text has clear sentence boundaries

**When to use spaCy mode (use_spacy=True):**

- You need the highest accuracy
- Your text has complex abbreviations or edge cases
- You're processing professional/academic content
- Quality is more important than speed

Colon Splitting (Deprecated)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``split_on_colon`` parameter is deprecated and no longer affects output. It
is accepted for API compatibility and raises a ``DeprecationWarning`` when set
to ``False``. Colon handling is delegated to the active backend (spaCy or the
regex fallback).

Splitting Clauses
-----------------

The :func:`~phrasplit.split_clauses` function splits text at commas, creating
natural pause points ideal for audiobook and text-to-speech applications.
Like :func:`~phrasplit.split_sentences`, it supports both spaCy and simple modes:

.. code-block:: python

   from phrasplit import split_clauses

   text = "I like coffee, and I like tea."

   # Automatic mode detection
   clauses = split_clauses(text)
   print(clauses)
   # ['I like coffee,', 'and I like tea.']

   # Force simple mode
   clauses = split_clauses(text, use_spacy=False)
   # Uses regex-based clause splitting

The comma is kept at the end of each clause, preserving the original punctuation.

More complex example:

.. code-block:: python

   text = "When the sun rose, the birds began to sing, and the day started."
   clauses = split_clauses(text)
   # ['When the sun rose,', 'the birds began to sing,', 'and the day started.']

Splitting Paragraphs
--------------------

The :func:`~phrasplit.split_paragraphs` function splits text at double newlines:

.. code-block:: python

   from phrasplit import split_paragraphs

   text = """First paragraph with some text.

   Second paragraph with more text.

   Third paragraph."""

   paragraphs = split_paragraphs(text)
   # ['First paragraph with some text.',
   #  'Second paragraph with more text.',
   #  'Third paragraph.']

The function handles multiple blank lines and whitespace-only lines:

.. code-block:: python

   text = "First.\n\n\n\nSecond."  # Multiple blank lines
   paragraphs = split_paragraphs(text)
   # ['First.', 'Second.']

Hierarchical Splitting with split_text
--------------------------------------

The :func:`~phrasplit.split_text` function provides a unified interface for
splitting text while preserving paragraph and sentence structure. This is
particularly useful for audiobook generation where you need different pause
lengths between paragraphs, sentences, and clauses.

.. code-block:: python

   from phrasplit import split_text, Segment

   text = "First sentence. Second sentence.\n\nNew paragraph here."
   segments = split_text(text, mode="sentence")

   for seg in segments:
       print(f"Paragraph {seg.paragraph}, Sentence {seg.sentence}: {seg.text}")
   # Paragraph 0, Sentence 0: First sentence.
   # Paragraph 0, Sentence 1: Second sentence.
   # Paragraph 1, Sentence 0: New paragraph here.

Available Modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ``"paragraph"``: Returns paragraphs only (``sentence`` is None)
- ``"sentence"``: Returns sentences with paragraph tracking
- ``"clause"``: Returns clauses with paragraph and sentence tracking

.. code-block:: python

   # Paragraph mode
   segments = split_text(text, mode="paragraph")
   # Each segment has sentence=None

   # Sentence mode (default)
   segments = split_text(text, mode="sentence")
   # Each segment has paragraph and sentence indices

   # Clause mode - finest granularity
   text = "Hello, world. Goodbye, friend."
   segments = split_text(text, mode="clause")
   # Returns: Hello, | world. | Goodbye, | friend.
   # All with paragraph and sentence tracking

Detecting Structure Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the ``Segment`` fields to detect when paragraphs or sentences change:

.. code-block:: python

   from phrasplit import split_text

   text = "Sent 1. Sent 2.\n\nSent 3."
   segments = split_text(text, mode="sentence")

   for i, seg in enumerate(segments):
       if i > 0 and seg.paragraph != segments[i-1].paragraph:
           print("--- New Paragraph ---")
       print(seg.text)

Splitting Long Lines
--------------------

The :func:`~phrasplit.split_long_lines` function breaks long lines at natural
boundaries (sentences and clauses) to fit within a maximum length:

.. code-block:: python

   from phrasplit import split_long_lines

   text = "This is a very long sentence. This is another sentence that makes it even longer."
   lines = split_long_lines(text, max_length=40)
   # Each line will be <= 40 characters when possible

The splitting strategy:

1. First, try to split at sentence boundaries
2. If still too long, split at clause boundaries (commas)
3. If still too long, split at word boundaries

Using Different Language Models
-------------------------------

All functions that use spaCy accept a ``language_model`` parameter:

.. code-block:: python

   from phrasplit import split_sentences

   # Use a larger, more accurate model
   sentences = split_sentences(text, language_model="en_core_web_lg")

   # Use a model for another language
   sentences = split_sentences(german_text, language_model="de_core_news_sm")

Make sure to download the model first:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m spacy download de_core_news_sm

Processing Pipeline Example
---------------------------

Here's a complete example of processing a document:

.. code-block:: python

   from phrasplit import split_paragraphs, split_sentences, split_clauses

   def process_document(text):
       """Process a document into structured parts."""
       result = []

       for para_idx, paragraph in enumerate(split_paragraphs(text)):
           para_data = {"paragraph": para_idx + 1, "sentences": []}

           for sent_idx, sentence in enumerate(split_sentences(paragraph)):
               sent_data = {
                   "sentence": sent_idx + 1,
                   "text": sentence,
                   "clauses": split_clauses(sentence)
               }
               para_data["sentences"].append(sent_data)

           result.append(para_data)

       return result

   # Example usage
   text = """Hello world, this is a test. Another sentence here.

   Second paragraph with more content, and some clauses."""

   structure = process_document(text)

Simplified Pipeline with split_text
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The same can be achieved more simply with :func:`~phrasplit.split_text`:

.. code-block:: python

   from phrasplit import split_text

   text = """Hello world, this is a test. Another sentence here.

   Second paragraph with more content, and some clauses."""

   # Get all clauses with full structure information
   segments = split_text(text, mode="clause")

   for seg in segments:
       print(f"P{seg.paragraph} S{seg.sentence}: {seg.text}")

The ``use_spacy`` parameter is also available for :func:`~phrasplit.split_text`:

.. code-block:: python

   # Use simple mode for faster processing
   segments = split_text(text, mode="sentence", use_spacy=False)

   # Explicitly use spaCy mode
   segments = split_text(text, mode="sentence", use_spacy=True)
