Installation
============

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.9 or higher
- click 8.0 or higher
- rich 13.0 or higher
- spaCy 3.5 or higher (optional, for high-accuracy mode)

Installation Options
--------------------

phrasplit can be installed with or without spaCy support, depending on your needs.

Basic Installation (Lightweight)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a lightweight installation without spaCy (uses regex-based splitting):

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install phrasplit

This installation is sufficient for basic text splitting and has no heavy dependencies.

Full Installation with spaCy (Recommended)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For higher accuracy sentence splitting with spaCy NLP:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install phrasplit[spacy]

Or install spaCy separately:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install phrasplit
   pip install spacy>=3.5.0

Installing from Source
----------------------

To install from source, clone the repository and install:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/holgern/phrasplit.git
   cd phrasplit
   pip install -e .

For development, install with dev dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e ".[dev]"

For spaCy support when installing from source:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e ".[spacy]"

Installing spaCy Language Models
---------------------------------

If you installed with spaCy support, you'll need a language model. The default
model is ``en_core_web_sm`` (English). Install it with:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

For better accuracy, you can use larger models:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Medium model (more accurate)
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_md

   # Large model (most accurate)
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg

For other languages, see the `spaCy models documentation
<https://spacy.io/models>`_.

Verifying Installation
----------------------

You can verify your installation by running:

.. code-block:: python

   import phrasplit
   print(phrasplit.__version__)

   from phrasplit import split_sentences

   # Works with or without spaCy
   print(split_sentences("Hello world. How are you?"))
   # ['Hello world.', 'How are you?']

   # Explicitly use simple mode (no spaCy required)
   print(split_sentences("Hello world. How are you?", use_spacy=False))
   # ['Hello world.', 'How are you?']

Choosing Between Modes
-----------------------

**Simple Mode (use_spacy=False)**

- No spaCy installation required
- Faster processing
- Lower memory usage
- Good for straightforward text
- Uses regex-based splitting

**spaCy Mode (use_spacy=True, default if available)**

- Requires spaCy and language models
- Higher accuracy
- Better handling of complex cases
- Uses NLP-based analysis
- Recommended for production use
