## Usage

PyFMTO's CLI is available in any working directory, just make sure:

1. The Python environment is properly set up and activated
2. The PyFMTO is installed
3. A valid configuration file is provided in the current working directory

For more details, please refer to:

1. [Quick Start](#quick-start)
2. [PyFMTO CLI](#command-line-interface-cli)
3. [About fmto](#about-fmto)


### Quick Start

Create an environment and install PyFMTO:

```bash
conda create -n fmto python=3.10
conda activate fmto
pip install pyfmto
```

Clone the [fmto](https://github.com/Xiaoxu-Zhang/fmto.git) repository ([why?](#about-fmto)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Xiaoxu-Zhang/fmto.git
cd fmto
```

Start the experiments:

```bash
pyfmto run
```

Generate reports:

```bash
pyfmto report
```

The reports will be saved in the folder `out/results/<today>`

### Command-line Interface (CLI)

PyFMTO provides a command-line interface (CLI) for running experiments, analyzing results and
get helps. The CLI layers are as follows:

```txt
pyfmto
   ├── -h/--help
   ├── run
   ├── report
   ├── list algorithms/problems/reports
   └── show algorithms.<alg_name>/problems.<prob_name>
```

**Examples:**

- Get help:

    ```bash
    pyfmto -h # or ↓
    # pyfmto --help
    # pyfmto list -h
    ```

- Run experiments:

    ```bash
    pyfmto run # or ↓
    # pyfmto run -c config.yaml
    ```

- Generate reports:

    ```bash
    pyfmto report # or ↓
    # pyfmto report -c config.yaml
    ```

- List something:

    ```bash
    pyfmto list algorithms  # or ↓ 
    # pyfmto list problems
    ```

- Show supported configurations:

    ```bash
    pyfmto show algorithms.<alg_name>  # or ↓  
    # pyfmto show problems.<prob_name>
    ```

> **Notes**:
>
> Every subcommand support `-c/--config <config_file>`
>
> In the subcommands `list` and `show`, strings 'algorithms', 'problems', and 'reports' can be
> replaced with any prefix of length ≥ 1. PyFMTO matches the prefix to the corresponding category.
> For example:
>
> `pyfmto list algorithms` is equivalent to:
>
> - `pyfmto list a`
> - `pyfmto list al`
> - `pyfmto list alg`
> - ...
>
> `pyfmto show problems.<prob_name>` is equivalent to:
>
> - `pyfmto show p.<prob_name>`
> - `pyfmto show prob.<prob_name>`
> - ...

### Use PyFMTO in Python

```python

from pyfmto import Launcher, Reporter, ConfigLoader

if __name__ == '__main__':
    conf = ConfigLoader()
    launcher = Launcher(conf.launcher)
    reports = Reporter(conf.reporter)
    reports.to_excel()
```

## About fmto

The repository [fmto](https://github.com/Xiaoxu-Zhang/fmto) is the official collection of
published FMTO algorithms. The relationship between the `fmto` and `PyFMTO` is as follows:

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Xiaoxu-Zhang/zxx-assets/raw/main/fmto-relation.svg"/>
<p>

The `fmto` is designed to provide a platform for researchers to compare and evaluate the
performance of different FMTO algorithms. The repository is built on top of the PyFMTO library,
which provides a flexible and extensible framework for implementing FMTO algorithms.

It also serves as a practical example of how to structure and perform experiments. The repository
includes the following components:

- A collection of published FMTO algorithms.
- A config file (config.yaml) that provides guidance on how to set up and configure the experiments.
- A template algorithm named "DEMO" that you can use as a basis for implementing your own algorithm.
- A template problem named "demo" that you can use as a basis for implementing your own problem.

The `config.yaml`, `algorithms/DEMO` and `problems/demo` provided detailed instructions, you can
even start your research without additional documentation. The fmto repository is currently in
the early stages of development. I'm actively working on improving existing algorithms and adding
new algorithms.

## Algorithm's Components

An algorithm includes two parts: the client and the server. The client is responsible for
optimizing the local problem and the server is responsible for aggregating the knowledge from
the clients. The required components for client and server are as follows:

```python
# myalg_client.py
from pyfmto import Client, Server

class MyClient(Client):
 def __init__(self, problem, **kwargs):
  super().__init__(problem)

 def optimize():
  # implement the optimizer
  pass

class MyServer(Server):
 def __init__(self, **kwargs):
  super().__init__():
 
 def aggregate(self) -> None:
  # implement the aggregate logic
  pass

 def handle_request(self, pkg) -> Any:
  # handle the requests of clients to exchange data
  pass
```

## Problem's Components

There are two types of problems: single-task problems and multitask problems. A single-task
problem is a problem that has only one objective function. A multitask problem is a problem that
has multiple single-task problems. To define a multitask problem, you should implement several
SingleTaskProblem and then define a MultiTaskProblem to aggregate them.

> **Note**: There are some classical SingleTaskProblem defined in `pyfmto.problems.benchmarks`
> module. You can use them directly.

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy import ndarray
from pyfmto.problem import SingleTaskProblem, MultiTaskProblem
from typing import Union


class MySTP(SingleTaskProblem):

    def __init__(self, dim=2, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(dim=dim, obj=1, lb=0, ub=1, **kwargs)

    def _eval_single(self, x: ndarray):
        pass


class MyMTP(MultiTaskProblem):
    is_realworld = False
    intro = "user defined MTP"
    notes = "a demo of user-defined MTP"
    references = ['ref1', 'ref2']

    def __init__(self, dim=10, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(dim, **kwargs)

    def _init_tasks(self, dim, **kwargs) -> list[SingleTaskProblem]:
        # Duplicate MySTP for 10 here as an example
        return [MySTP(dim=dim, **kwargs) for _ in range(10)]
  ```

## Tools

### load_problem

```python
from pyfmto import load_problem

# init a problem with customized args
prob = load_problem('arxiv2017', dim=2, fe_init=20, fe_max=50, npd=5)

# problem instance can be print
print(prob)
```

## Visualization

### SingleTaskProblem Visualization

```python
from pyfmto.problem.benchmarks import Ackley

task = Ackley()
task.plot_2d(f'visualize2D')
task.plot_3d(f'visualize3D')
task.iplot_3d()  # interactive plotting
```

### MultiTaskProblem Visualization

The right side interactive plotting at the beginning is generated by the following code:

```python
from pyfmto import load_problem

if __name__ == '__main__':
    prob = load_problem('arxiv2017', dim=2)
    prob.iplot_tasks_3d(tasks_id=[2, 5, 12, 18])
```
