"""
Subentity Package - Unified Relationship Management and Entity Control

This package provides subentities and relationship management systems for Domo objects.
It includes legacy access/membership classes and new unified relationship systems.

Unified Relationship System (Recommended):
    Relationships: Comprehensive relationship modeling across all Domo entity types
    - Access relationships (HAS_ACCESS_OWNER, HAS_ACCESS_EDITOR, etc.)
    - Membership relationships (IS_MEMBER_OF, IS_OWNER_OF, etc.)
    - Lineage relationships (IS_DERIVED_FROM, USES_DATA_FROM, etc.)
    - Certification relationships (IS_CERTIFIED_BY, IS_TAGGED_WITH, etc.)
    - Unified API across all relationship types and object types

Legacy Access Control System:
    AccessControl: Simplified access management for migration purposes
    - Standardized access levels (OWNER, ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER, etc.)
    - Basic access grant tracking
    - Unified API across Domo object types

Legacy Classes (being phased out):
    DomoAccess: Account-specific access management
    DomoMembership: Group membership management

Other Subentities:
    DomoCertification: Content certification management
    DomoLineage: Entity relationship and lineage tracking
    DomoTag: Content tagging and categorization
    FederationContext: Federation state management for published/subscribed entities

Migration Path:
    Legacy → AccessControl → Relationships
    The new Relationships system is the most comprehensive and can model
    all types of entity relationships in Domo, not just access control.
