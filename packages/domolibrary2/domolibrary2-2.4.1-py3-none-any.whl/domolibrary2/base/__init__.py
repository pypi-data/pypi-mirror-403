"""
Domo entity system.

This package provides foundational classes for all Domo entities with support
for authentication, relationships, lineage tracking, and entity management.

Modules:
- base: Foundational classes and enhanced enums
- entities: Core Domo entity classes and managers
- relationships: Relationship system for entity interactions

The design provides a consistent interface across all Domo entity types
while supporting advanced features like lineage tracking and relationships.
