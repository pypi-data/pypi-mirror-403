  positive: |
    You are an AI assistant designed to generate high-quality training data for semantic text embedding models.
    Your task is to create a positive pair for a given "Anchor" text.

    A high-quality positive pair consists of two sentences that are semantically equivalent or highly similar in meaning, but differ in wording, syntax, and sentence structure.
    They should be paraphrases of each other.

    Instructions:
    - Preserve Core Meaning: The generated sentence must convey the same key information, intent, and context as the Anchor.
    - Vary Lexicon: Use different words and phrases (synonyms, related terms).
    - Vary Syntax: Change the sentence structure (e.g., active to passive voice, change clause order, combine or split sentences).
    - Maintain Similar Length: The generated sentence should be of roughly the same length and level of detail as the Anchor.
    - Avoid Minor Changes: Do not just add/remove a few words or swap names. Create a fundamentally different sentence.

    Anchor Text:
    "{text}"

  negative: |
    You are an AI assistant designed to generate high-quality training data for semantic text embedding models.
    Your task is to create a negative sample for a given "Anchor" text.

    A high-quality negative sample is a sentence that is semantically unrelated to the Anchor's specific question, while staying within the same general domain (religious topics).

    Instructions:
    - Stay in Domain: The sentence must be about the text's topics, but on a different subject
    - Ensure Clear Distinction: The topic should be clearly different from the anchor's specific focus
    - Maintain Similar Length: The generated sentence should be of roughly the same length and level of detail as the Anchor.

  hard_negative: |
      You are an AI assistant designed to generate high-quality training data for semantic text embedding models.
      Your task is to create a hard-negative sample for a given "Anchor" text.

      A high-quality hard-negative sample is a sentence that is topically related but semantically distinct from the Anchor.
      It should share some context (e.g., same domain, same entities) but differ in a crucial piece of information, action, conclusion, or specific detail.

      Instructions:
      - Stay in General Domain: Remain in the same broad domain (e.g., religious topics), but choose a completely different subject matter.
      - Maintain Topical Overlap: Keep the same domain, subject, or entities (e.g., people, products, concepts) as the Anchor.
      - Alter a Key Semantic Element: Reverse a key word or condition or place or proper name that completely reverses the meaning of the sentence.
      - Avoid Being a Paraphrase: The sentence must NOT be semantically equivalent. The core factual claim or intent must be different.
      - Make it Challenging: The difference should be subtle enough that it requires a deep understanding of the text to identify, not just a simple keyword mismatch.
      - Maintain Similar Length: The generated sentence should be of roughly the same length and level of detail as the Anchor.

analyze_template:

  positive: |
    Analyze the following text to understand its CORE SEMANTIC MEANING for creating a high-quality POSITIVE sample.
    
    Focus on:
    - Core Intent: What is the fundamental question or statement being made?
    - Key Entities/Concepts: What are the main subjects, objects, and concepts?
    - Semantic Relationships: How are the entities related?
    - Context & Domain: What is the broader context and domain?
    
    Your analysis should capture the ESSENTIAL MEANING that must be preserved in any paraphrase.
    
    Here is the text:
    {text}

  negative: |
    Analyze the following text to identify its SPECIFIC TOPIC and DOMAIN for creating a high-quality NEGATIVE sample.
    
    Focus on:
    - Specific Topic: What exact subject is this text about?
    - Domain Context: What broader domain does this belong to?
    - Key Elements to AVOID: What concepts, entities, or phrases must NOT appear in the negative sample?
    - Alternative Topics: What are related but DISTINCT topics within the same domain?
    
    The goal is to find topics that are in the same domain but semantically unrelated to this specific text.
    
    Here is the text:
    {text}

  hard_negative: |
    Analyze this text to identify EXACTLY ONE ELEMENT that can be changed to create a hard-negative sample.
    
    CRITICAL: The hard-negative must keep the SAME TOPIC and MOST WORDS identical.
    
    Identify ONE change from these options:
    - Change a quantity/order word (first→last, one→many)
    - Change a key location/entity to a related one (paradise→hell, heaven→earth)
    - Change the question focus slightly (who→what, what→how)
    - Change a key action verb to a related action (enter→exit, give→take)
    
    PRESERVE:
    - Main topic and subject
    - Sentence structure
    - 80-90% of the vocabulary
    
    Here is the text:
    {text}
