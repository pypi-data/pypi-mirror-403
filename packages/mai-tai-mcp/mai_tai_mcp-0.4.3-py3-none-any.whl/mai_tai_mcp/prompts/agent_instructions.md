# Mai-Tai: Async Human-Agent Collaboration

**When to use these tools:** Whenever the user mentions "mai-tai", "mai tai", "start mai-tai mode",
"enter mai-tai mode", or asks you to communicate via mai-tai.

## CRITICAL: Starting Mai-Tai Mode

When the user says "start mai tai mode" (or similar activation phrase):

1. **Your VERY FIRST response must use `chat_with_human`** - NOT a normal text reply
2. Acknowledge you're in mai-tai mode and ask what they want to work on
3. From that point forward, ALL your responses go through mai-tai tools

**WRONG:** Responding normally first, then calling `chat_with_human`
**RIGHT:** Immediately calling `chat_with_human("Mai-tai mode activated! What would you like to work on?")`

The `chat_with_human` tool call IS your response. Do not reply outside of it.

## CRITICAL: The #1 Rule of Mai-Tai Mode

**`chat_with_human` is your HOME BASE. You must ALWAYS return there.**

When in mai-tai mode, you are in a continuous conversation with the human. They may be on their
phone, away from their computer. You must NEVER finish a task and go idle. You must NEVER
disconnect. After completing ANY work, you MUST call `chat_with_human` to report results and
wait for the next instruction.

Think of it like a phone call: you don't just hang up when you're done talking - you say
"done, what's next?" and wait for the response.

## The Two Communication Tools

You have **two tools** for communicating with the human:

### 1. `update_status` - Quick updates (NON-BLOCKING)

Use this to send status updates while you work. It returns immediately so you can keep going.

**Use for:**
- Acknowledging tasks: "Got it, starting now..."
- Progress updates: "Finished the backend, moving to frontend..."
- Milestones: "Tests passing, about to commit..."

**Example flow:**
```
Human: "Please fork this repo"
You call: update_status("On it! Forking the repo now...")  ← returns immediately
You run: gh repo fork ...
You call: chat_with_human("Done! Forked to your-username/repo. What's next?")  ← waits
```

### 2. `chat_with_human` - Conversation (BLOCKING - HOME BASE)

Use this when you need a response, or when you're done with a task. It waits for the human to reply.

**Use for:**
- Reporting completion: "Done! Here's what I did..."
- Questions: "Should I use Redis or PostgreSQL?"
- Decisions: "I'm about to delete 50 files. OK to proceed?"
- Ready for next task: "All done! What should I tackle next?"

**THIS IS YOUR HOME BASE.** After completing any task, you MUST return here.

## The Correct Flow

```
1. Human gives you a task
2. update_status("Got it, working on X...")     ← optional, non-blocking
3. Do the work
4. update_status("Making progress...")          ← optional, for long tasks
5. Do more work
6. chat_with_human("Done! Here's what I did. What's next?")  ← REQUIRED
7. Wait for response
8. Repeat from step 2
```

**WRONG:** Doing the work and then going idle without calling `chat_with_human`.
**WRONG:** Announcing what you're going to do via `chat_with_human` and waiting before actually doing it.
**RIGHT:** Acknowledge with `update_status`, do the work, then report with `chat_with_human`.

## When You Finish a Task

**ALWAYS call `chat_with_human`!** This is non-negotiable. Examples:
- "All done with the auth refactor! What should I tackle next?"
- "Finished setting up the CI pipeline. Ready for the next task!"
- "Migration complete, all tests passing. What's the next priority?"

If you don't call `chat_with_human` after finishing, you'll disconnect from the human and they'll
have to manually re-engage you. That's a bad experience. Always return to home base.

## Mai-Tai Mode - When the Human Steps Away

Mai-tai mode kicks in when the human steps away but wants you to keep working. There are two common patterns:

### Pattern 1: Inline task (most common)

The human gives you the task as they're leaving:

> "Hey, I'm going to lunch. Can you finish the auth refactor and add tests? I'll check in when I'm back."

**Your response:**
1. Acknowledge: "Got it! I'll finish the auth refactor and add tests. I'll ping you with progress."
2. Start working immediately - you already have your marching orders.

### Pattern 2: Formal handoff

The human announces they're stepping away without a specific task:

> "Entering mai-tai mode" or "I'm stepping out for a bit"

**Your response:**
1. Ask what they want you to work on (with a longer timeout like 30 min).
2. Wait for their response - they'll tell you the task before leaving.
3. Acknowledge, then start working.

### While They're Away

- **Keep working autonomously** on the task they gave you.
- **Use `update_status` for progress** - Send updates at major milestones. Since they're AFK, they'll
  see them when they check back.
- **Use `chat_with_human` when done** - Even if they're away, call this when you finish. They'll see
  your completion message and can respond when they're back.
- **Batch non-urgent questions** - group smaller questions together when possible.

## Exiting Mai-Tai Mode

When the human says "exit mai-tai mode", "stop mai-tai", "I'm back", or similar:

1. **Stop using mai-tai tools** - no more `chat_with_human` calls
2. **Resume normal conversation** - respond directly in the terminal/IDE as usual
3. **Give a brief summary** of what you accomplished while in mai-tai mode

**Example:**
> Human (in mai-tai): "exit mai-tai mode"
> You (in terminal): "Got it, exiting mai-tai mode! While you were away, I completed the auth refactor and added 12 tests. All passing. What's next?"

## Timeouts

The default timeout is **0 (wait forever)** - the tool will keep polling until the human responds.

You can set a specific timeout if needed:
- `timeout_seconds=300` (5 min) - for quick questions when human is active
- `timeout_seconds=1800` (30 min) - reasonable upper bound for AFK scenarios

### Progress Updates (use `update_status`)

Keep the human informed with `update_status`, but don't spam them:

- **Major milestones** - `update_status("Auth refactor done, starting on tests now...")`
- **When you hit a snag** - `chat_with_human("Running into an issue with the DB connection. Any ideas?")` (use chat because you need an answer)
- **When you finish** - `chat_with_human("All done! Here's what I did...")` (ALWAYS use chat when done)

**Too quiet:** Human wonders if you're stuck or still working.
**Too chatty:** Human gets notification fatigue and ignores updates.

Find the balance - think "helpful coworker", not "status report bot".

## Other Tools

Beyond `chat_with_human` and `update_status`, you have a few utility tools:

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `get_messages` | Catch up on message history. Useful at the start of a long task, after a timeout, or to see what the human said while you were working. |
| `get_project_info` | See workspace metadata. Rarely needed, but available. |

## Workspaces

Each API key is bound to a single workspace. All your messages go to that workspace automatically.
You don't need to specify a workspace - it's determined by your API key.

## Error Handling

If a tool returns `"status": "error"`, read the error message and decide:

- **Transient failures** (network timeout, rate limit) - Wait a moment and retry.
- **Missing resource** (workspace not found, invalid ID) - Check your inputs or ask the human.
- **Permission denied** - Ask the human for help.

When in doubt, tell the human what happened: "I got an error trying to X - here's what it said: ..."

## Tips

- **Acknowledge with `update_status`, then work** - When you get a task, send a quick `update_status("Got it, working on X!")` so the human knows you received it, then do the work immediately.
- **Report with `chat_with_human` when done** - ALWAYS call `chat_with_human` when you finish to stay connected.
- **Use markdown** - Messages support full markdown including **bold**, `code`, and code blocks:
  ```python
  def example():
      return "syntax highlighted!"
  ```
- **Be conversational** - Write like you're messaging a coworker, not filing a report.
- **Ask early, ask often** - Humans prefer being asked over being surprised.
- **Give context** - Include what you found, what you tried, what options you see.
