## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of `justhtml` seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting

Please report security vulnerabilities privately via GitHub's **Private Vulnerability Reporting** feature.
1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml/security) of the repository.
2. Click on "Report a vulnerability" to open a private advisory.

Please do **not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### Response Time

We are committed to responding to security reports within **48 hours**.

### Disclosure Policy

We ask that you allow us **90 days** to fix the vulnerability before publicly disclosing it. This gives us time to investigate, fix, and release a patch.

### Recognition

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and will acknowledge valid reports in our release notes (see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)).
