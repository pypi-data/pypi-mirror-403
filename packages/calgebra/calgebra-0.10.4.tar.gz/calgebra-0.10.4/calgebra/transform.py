    Coalesces intervals that are close together in time, treating them as a

    remain distinct. When merging, metadata from the first interval in each
    group is preserved.

    Useful for clustering related events (alarms into incidents) or grouping
    closely-scheduled activities into blocks.

    Args:
        timeline: Source timeline to merge
        gap: Maximum gap (in seconds) between intervals to merge across

    Returns:

    Note:
        Unlike flatten(), merge_within() preserves metadata from the first
        interval in each merged group. Use flatten() when you don't need
        to preserve metadata and want all adjacent/overlapping intervals
        coalesced regardless of gap size.
