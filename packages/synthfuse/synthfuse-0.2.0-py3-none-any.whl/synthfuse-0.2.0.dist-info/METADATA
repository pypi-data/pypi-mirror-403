# Synth-Fuse v0.2.0 – Unified Field Engineering

**A Deterministic Hybrid Organism** that fuses abstract logic with low‑level thermodynamic execution.

## 🏛️ Project Vision

Synth‑Fuse is a neuro‑symbolic execution environment that bridges *high‑level abstract logic* and *hardware‑level physics*. By treating computation as a **Semantic‑Thermodynamic Loop (STCL)**, every logical impulse is:

* mathematically stable  
* thermodynamically coherent  
* cryptographically certified before it reaches the hardware

## 🧠 The Cabinet of Alchemists

A decentralized council of specialist agents governs every stage of the lifecycle:

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **The Architect** | Designs high‑level strategies on the **Sigil Space** (W‑Orion search) |
| **The Engineer** | "Solders" Sigils into JAX‑traceable HLO kernels |
| **The Librarian** | Manages the **Zeta‑Vault** – native data ingestion |
| **The Physician** | Monitors manifold "vitals" and performs surgical roll‑backs |
| **The Shield** | Enforces OpenGate safety certificates and Lyapunov‑based stability |
| **The Body** | Dynamically redistributes computational load |
| **The Jury** | Validates Sigil impulses via weighted Bayesian consensus |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install -e .[all]

# Start Cabinet
synthfuse

# Open Lab interface
streamlit run lab/app.py
