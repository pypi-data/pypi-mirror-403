+## Key Principles
1. Respect the existing code style and conventions
3. Use the defined standards. Avoid adding superfluous code for deprecated functions.
4. Test thoroughly before submitting
5. Write clear, descriptive commit messages
6. Identify yourself as AI in commits (see below)


## AI Attribution Requirement
When creating commits, you MUST identify yourself as an AI assistant by including the following tag in the commit message:

```
Co-developed-by: $AI_NAME $AI_MODEL $AI_VERSION
```

For example:
- `Co-developed-by: Claude claude-3-opus-20240229`
- `Co-developed-by: GitHub-Copilot GPT-4 v1.0.0`
- `Co-developed-by: Cursor gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09`

This transparency helps maintainers and reviewers understand that AI was involved in the development process.
