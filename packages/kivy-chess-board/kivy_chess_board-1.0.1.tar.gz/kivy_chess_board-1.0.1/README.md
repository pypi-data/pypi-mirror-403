# ChessBoard - a Kivy Widget to interact with a Chess Board

This package provides a chess board as a kivy widget. It allows users to
interact with the chess board by dragging and dropping pieces, and it can be
integrated into Kivy applications.

The widget displays the current state of a `chess.Board` from the
`python-chess` library. It supports highlighting specific moves and selecting
squares. By design, it does not implement any game logic or enforce chess rules;
it simply reflects the state of the provided `chess.Board` and notifies the host
application of user interactions.

## Exmaple Usage

See the [documentation](https://kivy-chess-board-ebce1f.gitlab.io/) for more
details and full API reference.

        # moves.
