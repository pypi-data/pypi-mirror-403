## Available Tools

### get_session_length_distribution
Session duration pattern analysis:
- **Length categorization**: Short (<30min), Medium (30-120min), Long (>120min)
- **Distribution percentages**: Understanding session length patterns
- **Duration statistics**: Average and median session lengths
- **Pattern identification**: Work session sustainability insights

**Usage:**
```python
# Last 30 days (default)
get_session_length_distribution()

# Last 7 days for specific project
get_session_length_distribution(project_path="/path/to/project", days_back=7)
```

**Key Metrics:**
- `short_percentage`: % of quick sessions (<30min)
- `medium_percentage`: % of standard sessions (30-120min)
- `long_percentage`: % of marathon sessions (>120min)
- `median_duration_minutes`: Typical session length

### get_temporal_patterns
Time-based session pattern detection:
- **Time of day distribution**: Morning/afternoon/evening/night breakdown
- **Day of week patterns**: Monday-Sunday session frequency
- **Peak productivity windows**: Best times for focused work
- **Frequency trends**: Session consistency over time

**Usage:**
```python
result = await get_temporal_patterns(days_back=14)
print(f"Peak productivity: {result['most_productive_time_slot']}")
print(f"Frequency trend: {result['session_frequency_trend']}")
```

**Key Metrics:**
- `peak_productivity_hour`: Hour (0-23) with most activity
- `peak_productivity_day`: Most productive day
- `most_productive_time_slot`: Best time slot (e.g., "Tuesday morning")
- `session_frequency_trend`: "increasing", "stable", or "decreasing"

### get_activity_correlations
Relationship analysis between session activities:
- **Duration vs Quality**: Do longer sessions produce better work?
- **Duration vs Commits**: More time = more commits?
- **Quality vs Commits**: Commit rate correlation with quality
- **High-performance sessions**: Count of exceptional sessions

**Usage:**
```python
result = await get_activity_correlations()

# Check if longer sessions correlate with quality
corr = result['duration_quality_correlation']
if corr > 0.3:
    print("Longer sessions tend to have higher quality")
elif corr < -0.3:
    print("Shorter focused sessions work better")
```

**Key Metrics:**
- `duration_quality_correlation`: -1 to 1 (positive = longer is better)
- `quality_commits_correlation`: Quality vs commit frequency
- `high_quality_sessions`: Count of sessions with quality >= 80
- `long_high_quality_sessions`: Long sessions that maintained quality

### get_session_streaks
Consistency and momentum tracking:
- **Consecutive day streaks**: Measure development consistency
- **Current streak**: Active consecutive day count
- **Session gaps**: Time between sessions
- **Consistent patterns**: Regular daily work habits

**Usage:**
```python
result = await get_session_streaks(days_back=30)
print(f"Current streak: {result['current_streak_days']} days")
print(f"Longest streak: {result['longest_streak_days']} days")
print(f"Consistent daily work: {result['consistent_daily_sessions']}")
```

**Key Metrics:**
- `longest_streak_days`: Maximum consecutive days
- `current_streak_days`: Active streak length
- `avg_gap_between_sessions_hours`: Average time between sessions
- `consistent_daily_sessions`: 5+ day streaks achieved

### get_productivity_insights
Actionable recommendations for optimization:
- **Best performance windows**: Optimal times for focused work
- **Session length recommendations**: Ideal duration for your work
- **Break interval guidance**: How often to take breaks
- **Quality improvement suggestions**: Specific actionable advice

**Usage:**
```python
result = await get_productivity_insights()

# Get comprehensive recommendations
print(f"Best window: {result['best_performance_window']}")
print(f"Recommended: {result['recommended_session_length']}")
print(f"Break every: {result['optimal_break_interval']} minutes")

# Review suggestions
for suggestion in result['improvement_suggestions']:
    print(f"- {suggestion}")
```

**Key Metrics:**
- `best_performance_window`: When you do your best work
- `recommended_session_length`: Optimal duration for you
- `optimal_break_interval`: Suggested break frequency
- `improvement_suggestions`: Personalized recommendations

## Common Analytics Workflows

### Finding Your Optimal Schedule

1. **Analyze temporal patterns**:
   ```python
   temporal = await get_temporal_patterns(days_back=30)
   print(f"Best time: {temporal['most_productive_time_slot']}")
   print(f"Trend: {temporal['session_frequency_trend']}")
   ```

2. **Check session length patterns**:
   ```python
   length = await get_session_length_distribution()
   print(f"Medium sessions: {length['medium_percentage']:.1f}%")
   print(f"Median: {length['median_duration_minutes']} min")
   ```

3. **Get personalized recommendations**:
   ```python
   insights = await get_productivity_insights()
   print(f"Recommended: {insights['recommended_session_length']}")
   ```

### Improving Session Quality

**Low Quality Correlation with Duration** (< -0.3):
- Consider shorter, more focused sessions
- Take breaks more frequently
- Avoid marathon coding sessions

**Low Quality Sessions** (>30% below 60):
- Review `get_activity_correlations()` for patterns
- Check if time of day affects quality
- Ensure adequate rest between sessions

**Inconsistent Schedule** (frequency_trend = "decreasing"):
- Use `get_session_streaks()` to track consistency
- Aim for at least one session per day
- Build streaks gradually

### Optimizing Workflow

**High Commit Rate, Low Quality**:
- Focus on code quality over quantity
- Review before committing more frequently
- Consider test-driven development

**Long Sessions, Low Productivity**:
- Try Pomodoro technique (25min work + 5min break)
- Break marathon sessions into focused blocks
- Schedule regular review points

**Peak Productivity Discovery**:
1. Run `get_temporal_patterns()` weekly
2. Identify your top 3 productive time slots
3. Schedule important work during these times
4. Reserve low-energy times for administrative tasks

## Best Practices

- **Weekly analytics review**: Run all tools weekly to track patterns
- **Before schedule changes**: Check analytics to predict impact
- **After workflow experiments**: Compare before/after metrics
- **Trend monitoring**: Watch for declining frequency or quality trends
- **Personalization**: Use insights to build your optimal schedule

## Interpreting Analytics

### Session Length Benchmarks
- **Balanced**: 40-60% medium sessions (30-120min)
- **Fragmented**: >60% short sessions (<30min) - may indicate distractions
- **Marathon-prone**: >40% long sessions (>120min) - risk of burnout

### Temporal Pattern Benchmarks
- **Consistent**: 5-7 sessions/week with stable distribution
- **Increasing**: Positive frequency trend over time
- **Peak windows**: 2-3x more sessions during best hours

### Correlation Benchmarks
- **Duration-Quality**: >0.3 means longer sessions work better for you
- **Quality-Commits**: >0.3 means more commits = better quality
- **Strong correlation**: |correlation| > 0.5 is statistically significant
