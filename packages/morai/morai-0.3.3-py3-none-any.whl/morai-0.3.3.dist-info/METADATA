## Overview

**📖 Description:**

[Moirai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moirai#:~:text=In%20ancient%20Greek%20religion%20and,Moirai) 
in greek mythology are known as the fates. They are personifications of destiny.
The name Morai was chosen as the package is designed to help actuaries review 
mortality and experience data.

## Installation

### Install

To install the base package

```
uv pip install morai
```

To install optional dependencies

```
uv pip install morai[dev][neural][r]
```

### Local Install
To install, download this repository and run the following command in 
the environment of choice. Optional dependencies can be installed by adding
`[dev][neural][r]` to the end of the command.

```
uv pip install -e .
```

### Docker Install
The package can also be run in docker which provides a containerized environment, hosting the web dashboard.

```bash
version: "3.8"
services:
  morai:
    image: dmbymdt/morai:latest
    container_name: morai
    command: gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8001 morai.dashboard.app:server
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MORAI_FILES_PATH: /code/morai/files # setting the files path for morai
    ports:
      - '8001:8001'
    volumes:
      - $DOCKERDIR/morai/files:/code/morai/files # mounting the files directory
```

## Usage

### CLI

CLI can be used for easier commands of python scripts for both portfolio or manager. An example of a CLI command is shown below. When running the dashboard the `MORAI_FILES_PATH` environment variable needs to be set to the directory where the files are stored.

```commandline
morai dashboard
```

It also can be run locally by running below in the root directory of the repository.

```python
python -m morai.dashboard.app
```

## Other Tools
### Jupyter Lab Usage

To have conda environments work with Jupyter Notebooks a kernel needs to be defined. This can be done defining a kernel, shown below when
in the conda environment.

```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=morai
```

If plotly images are not showing in the default set up there may need to be some extensions added to JupyterLab.
The extension particularly needed is the jupyterlab-plotly extension.
This is also discussed more in this issue: [Plotly Issue](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py/issues/2672)

### Logging

If wanting to get more detail in output of messages the logging can increased
```python
from morai.utils import custom_logger
custom_logger.set_log_level("DEBUG")
```

### Coverage

To see the test coverage the following command is run in the root directory.
```
pytest --cov=morai --cov-report=html
```
