"""Automatic batching and GPU memory management.

This module provides utilities for efficient batch processing of simulation states
by dynamically determining optimal batch sizes based on GPU memory constraints.
It includes tools for memory usage estimation, batch size determination, and
two complementary strategies for batching: binning and hot-swapping.

Example:
    Using BinningAutoBatcher with a model::

        batcher = BinningAutoBatcher(model, memory_scales_with="n_atoms")
        batcher.load_states(states)
        final_states = []
        for batch, _indices in batcher:
            final_states.append(evolve_batch(batch))
        final_states = batcher.restore_original_order(final_states)

Notes:
    Memory scaling estimates are approximate and may need tuning for specific
    model architectures and GPU configurations.
