# iKALI 1.0.10

iKali is a terrible program fuelled by hate and death. this program barely works correctly, 
and cannot run on windows for reasons i seriously do not know or understand. 
Please note that this crap is wholly untested, I am new to programming, and especially using linux. 

Update 1.0.5 - fixed broken keyboard interrupt code causing traceback error.
Update 1.0.6 - Downloading isn't working with previous fix.
Update 1.0.7 - Switched from pip to pipx, citing safety concerns. 
Update 1.0.8 - Testing if releasing on github works with pypi
Update v1.0.9 - figuring out naming conventions- added a "v"
