    """Computes resampling grid geometries metrics from given row and column
    grids.

    This function analyzes the validity of grid points (nodes) along rows and
    columns to determine bounding boxes and a transition matrix for resampling
    operations on grids. It returns detailed information about the source and
    destination grid bounds, as well as the transition matrix describing the
    linear transformation between source and destination grids.

    This method wraps a Rust function
    (`py_array1_compute_resampling_grid_geometries_f64_f64`) for grid metrics
    computation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid_row : np.ndarray
        A 2D array representing the row coordinates of the target grid,
        with the same shape as `grid_col`. The coordinates target row
        positions in the `array_in` input array.

    grid_col : np.ndarray
        A 2D array representing the column coordinates of the target grid,
        with the same shape as `grid_row`. The coordinates target column
        positions in the `array_in` input array.

    grid_resolution : Tuple[int, int]
        A tuple specifying the oversampling factor for the grid along rows and
        columns. A resolution value of 1 represents full resolution, while
        higher values indicate lower resolution grids.

    win : Optional[np.ndarray], default None
        An optional window (or sub-region) of the grid to limit the
        computation to a specific target region. The window is defined as a
        list of tuples containing the first and last indices for each dimension.
        If `None`, the entire grid is processed.

    grid_mask : Optional[np.ndarray], default None
        An optional integer mask array for the grid. Grid cells
        corresponding to `grid_mask_valid_value` are considered **valid**;
        all other values indicate **invalid** cells and will result in
        `nodata_out` in the output array. If not provided, the entire grid
        is considered valid. The grid mask must have the same shape as
        `grid_row` and `grid_col`.

    grid_mask_valid_value : Optional[int], default 1
        The value in `grid_mask` that designates a **valid** grid cell.
        All values in `grid_mask` that differ from this will be treated as
        **invalid**. This parameter is required if `grid_mask` is provided.

    grid_nodata : Optional[float], default None
        The value in `grid_row` and `grid_col` to consider as **invalid**
        cells. Note that this option is exclusive with `grid_mask`. This
        exclusivity is managed within the core bound method.

    Returns
    -------
    Union[PyGridGeometriesMetricsF64, None]
        A structure containing the computed metrics (`PyGridGeometriesMetricsF64`)
        or `None` if no valid metrics can be computed (e.g., empty grid).

    Raises
    ------

    Exception
        If the underlying Rust function
        `py_array1_compute_resampling_grid_geometries_f64_*` is not available
        for the provided input types.

    Exception
        If the `win` is outside of the array domain.

    Notes
    -----

    - This method serves as a preprocessing step prior to resampling raster-like
      data onto a target coordinate grid. The resulting transition matrix
      facilitates effective anti-aliasing management.
    - The computed source bounds are intended to restrict the read window of the
      input raster, optimizing data access. Similarly, the destination bounds
      define the output grid window, preventing  unnecessary processing of
      nodata regions.
    - The method is designed to support tiled processing workflows by accepting
      an optional window parameter, enabling integration within tile-based
      operations.

    Limitations
    -----------

    - The method assumes that all input arrays (`grid_row`, `grid_col`, etc.)
      are C-contiguous. If any of them are not, the method may raise an
      assertion error.
    - The method assumes that the grid-related arrays (`grid_row`, `grid_col`,
      `grid_mask`) have the same shapes. Mismatched shapes will raise an
      assertion error.
    - The `win` parameter, if provided, must be compatible with the grid shape.
      If `win` exceeds the bounds of the grid, an error may occur.
    - The method does not handle invalid or missing values in the input arrays
      or masks beyond what's specified by `grid_mask` or `grid_nodata`. Users
      are responsible for ensuring any invalid or missing data is appropriately
      handled before calling this method.

        Format: ``[[row_start, row_end], [col_start, col_end]]``. This is the
        window that should be used for the raster read IO.

    src_win_marged : numpy.ndarray of shape (2, 2)
        Desired read window with margins applied, before boundary correction
        (padding).

    pad : numpy.ndarray of shape (2, 2)
        Amount of padding required if the marged window extends outside the
        source array. Format: ``[[top_pad, bottom_pad], [left_pad, right_pad]]``.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is critical for operations requiring contextual data beyond
    the immediate processing area, such as filtering or interpolation, ensuring
    that no data loss or edge artifacts occur due to insufficient neighborhood
    information.

    The first dimension of the grid contains the variable. This function
    performs linear interpolation of both the grid data and its mask onto a new
    coordinate mesh defined by `x_new` and `y_new`.

    We assume here that the input mask follows the convention where all non-zero
    values are considered masked. The output mask will be binarized (i.e.,
    values equal to 0 or 1) according to a binarization threshold applied to the
    interpolated mask values:

    .. math::
        final\\_mask(i,j) = 0 \\quad \\text{only if} \\quad |interp\\_mask(i,j)| < threshold

    The grid is interpolated on the mesh generated by the `x_new` and `y_new`
    coordinates, using a linear interpolation method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : Optional[np.ndarray]
        Input 3-dimensional grid. Its first dimension should represent different
        variables or bands, while the subsequent two dimensions correspond to
        spatial (row, column) data.

    grid_mask : Optional[np.ndarray]
        Input 2-dimensional mask. This mask should have the same spatial
        dimensions as `grid` (i.e., its last two dimensions). Non-zero values
        are treated as masked.

    x : np.ndarray
        1D coordinates associated with the input `grid` (and `grid_mask`) for
        column indexes.

    y : np.ndarray
        1D coordinates associated with the input `grid` (and `grid_mask`) for
        row indexes.

    x_new : np.ndarray
        1D coordinates associated with the interpolated grid and mask for
        columns. This defines the new horizontal sampling of the output grid.

    y_new : np.ndarray
        1D coordinates associated with the interpolated grid and mask for rows.
        This defines the new vertical sampling of the output grid.

    dtype : Optional[np.dtype], default None
        Data type to use for computation and for the output interpolated grid.
        If `None`, it uses the same dtype as the input `grid`.

    mask_binarize_precision : float, default 1e-6
        Threshold used for the interpolated mask's binarization. Values with an
        absolute magnitude less than this threshold will be set to 0 in the
        output mask.

    mask_dtype : np.dtype, default np.uint8
        Data type of the output mask. This should typically be `np.uint8`
        (for 0 or 1 values) or `bool`.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]

    factors. It handles the definition of the target interpolation coordinates
    and leverages `interpolate_grid` for the actual resampling. The output grid
    and mask will have dimensions scaled by `grid_oversampling_row` and

    Parameters
    ----------
    grid : Optional[np.ndarray]
        Input 3-dimensional grid. Its first dimension represents different
        variables or bands, while the subsequent two dimensions correspond
        to spatial (row, column) data. Can be `None` if only `grid_mask`
        is to be oversampled.

    grid_oversampling_row : int
        Integer factor by which to oversample the grid along the row dimension.
        A value of 1 means no oversampling in this dimension.

    grid_oversampling_col : int
        Integer factor by which to oversample the grid along the column
        dimension. A value of 1 means no oversampling in this dimension.

    grid_mask : Optional[np.ndarray]
        Optional 2-dimensional mask associated with the input grid. If `grid` is
        `None`, this mask's shape is used to determine the original grid
        dimensions.

    dtype : Optional[np.dtype], default None
        Data type to use for computation and for the output interpolated grid.
        If `None`, it attempts to infer from `grid.dtype` if `grid` is provided
        and floating-point; otherwise, a `ValueError` is raised.

    grid_mask_binarize_precision : Optional[float], default 1e-6
        Threshold used for the interpolated mask's binarization. This
        parameter is passed directly to `interpolate_grid`.

    grid_mask_dtype : np.dtype, default np.uint8
        Data type of the output mask (e.g., `np.uint8` for 0 or 1 values,
        or `bool`). This parameter is passed directly to `interpolate_grid`.

    win : Optional[np.ndarray], default None
        An optional window (or sub-region) of the *oversampled* grid to compute.
        If `None`, the entire oversampled grid is processed. The window should
        be defined in terms of the *oversampled* coordinates
        (e.g., ``((row_start, row_end), (col_start, col_end))``).

    Returns
    -------

    """Create the target resolution grid.

    This method generates a grid at a specified target resolution by resampling
    an input raster-like grid. It performs no I/O operations.
    The function supports providing a preallocated output buffer for efficiency.

    A preallocated output buffer can be passed to the method via the `out`
    argument. If provided, its shape must be consistent with the expected output
    shape determined by `grid_target_win` and `resolution`.

    The data type used for interpolation can also be specified with
    `computation_dtype`. Note that if `computation_dtype` differs from the
    output buffer's data type (or the input grid's data type if `out` is not
    provided), an implicit cast to the output data type will be performed during
    the final assignment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    resolution : Tuple[int, int]
        The desired resolution of the output grid. Currently, only full
        resolution (i.e., `(1, 1)`) is implemented. This parameter influences
        the resampling (oversampling) of the input grid.

    grid : np.ndarray
        The input grid, expected to be a 3-dimensional NumPy array. Its first
        dimension typically represents different bands or variables.

    grid_target_win : np.ndarray
        The production window for the output grid. It's provided as a
        2-dimensional array of shape (2, 2) defining
        ``((first_row, last_row), (first_col, last_col))``. This window is
        expressed in the output grid's coordinate system.

    grid_resolution : Tuple[int, int]
        The resolution (oversampling factors) of the input `grid` in row and
        column directions. For example, `(2, 2)` means the input grid is twice
        oversampled in both dimensions compared to its intrinsic resolution.

    out : np.ndarray
        An optional preallocated NumPy array buffer to store the result.
        If provided, its shape must perfectly match the expected output shape
        derived from `grid_target_win` and `resolution`.

    computation_dtype : Optional[np.dtype], default None
        An optional data type to use for the interpolation computations.
        If `None`, it defaults to the `out` array's data type if `out` is given,
        or the `grid` data type otherwise.

    Returns
    -------
    Optional[np.ndarray]
        The computed grid as a NumPy array if `out` was `None`. If `out` was
        provided, the result is written directly into it, and this function
        returns `None`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `resolution` or `grid` are `None`.

    ValueError
        If the input `grid` does not have 3 dimensions.

    ValueError
        If the desired output `resolution` is not `(1, 1)` (due to current
        implementation limitations).

    ValueError
        If `grid_target_win` is not a 2D window.

    ValueError
        If `grid_target_win` is outside the bounds of the full-resolution
        input grid.

    ValueError
        If `out` is provided but its shape does not match the expected
