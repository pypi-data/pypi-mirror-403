"""
This module provides a framework for conducting binary tests on language models.

It defines data structures for storing test results and a base class for implementing
binary tests. Binary tests are tests that have a pass/fail outcome, and can be run
multiple times to gather statistics.

Classes:
    BinaryTestResult: Stores the result of a single binary test
    MultiBinaryTestResult: Stores and analyzes results from multiple binary tests
    BinaryTest: Base class for implementing binary tests on language models
