class TimeRangeDaysToNextRange(Phenotype):
    """
    TimeRangeDaysToNextRange identifies the time range that contains the anchor phenotype,
    then finds the adjacent time range (next or previous) and counts the days difference between them.

    If relative_time_range.when is 'after' (default):
        Finds the next consecutive time range.
        VALUE: Days difference between the end of anchored time range and start of next time range.
        EVENT_DATE: The start date of the next consecutive time range.

    If relative_time_range.when is 'before':
        Finds the previous consecutive time range.
        VALUE: Days difference between the start of the anchored time range and the end of the previous time range.
        EVENT_DATE: The end date of the previous consecutive time range.


    Example: Count number days to next hospitalization after index date hospitalization
        ```python
        from phenex.phenotypes import TimeRangeDaysToNextRange
