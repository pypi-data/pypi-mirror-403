# Example configuration file for JsonlRequirementReader
# This file demonstrates the configuration for reading requirements 
# from JSONL (JSON Lines) files.

[jsonl]
# Path to the directory containing requirement project folders (REQUIRED)
# This directory should contain:
# - Project folders (each folder represents a project)
# - UserDefinedAttributes.json (defines custom fields structure)
#
# Directory structure example:
# requirements/jsonl/
# ├── UserDefinedAttributes.json
# ├── Project1/
# │   ├── Baseline1.jsonl
# │   └── Baseline2.jsonl
# └── Project2/
#     └── Baseline1.jsonl
#
# As separator in the path, use "/" or "\\", but not "\"
requirements_path = "requirements/jsonl/"

# Notes on JSONL file structure:
# - Each line in a .jsonl file is a complete JSON object representing one requirement
# - Requirements must include: name, extendedID, key (with id and version), owner, 
#   status, priority, requirement (boolean), description, parent (null for root items)
# - Root requirements have parent = null
# - Child requirements reference their parent by the parent's extendedID
# - The "requirement" field set to true indicates an actual requirement vs. a folder node
#
# UserDefinedAttributes.json structure:
# [
#   {"name": "Risk Level", "valueType": "STRING"},
#   {"name": "Categories", "valueType": "ARRAY"},
#   {"name": "Approved", "valueType": "BOOLEAN"}
# ]
