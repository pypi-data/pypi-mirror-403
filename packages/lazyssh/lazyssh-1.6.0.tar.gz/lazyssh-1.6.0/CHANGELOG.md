and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.1] - 2025-10-13

### Added
- User plugin directories with clear precedence and environment override
  - Search order: `LAZYSSH_PLUGIN_DIRS` (left→right) → `~/.lazyssh/plugins` → packaged `plugins/`
  - Non-existent directories are ignored without errors
  - Safety: symlinks escaping base directories are skipped
- Runtime enforcement that packaged plugins are executable post-install
- Documentation updates for plugin locations and `LAZYSSH_PLUGIN_DIRS`
- Introduced severity-ranked priority findings to the `enumerate` plugin covering sudo membership, passwordless sudo rules, SUID/SGID binaries, world-writable paths, exposed services, weak SSH settings, suspicious schedulers, and kernel drift, rendered through Rich panels with a plain-text fallback and included in the JSON artifacts.

### Changed
- Refactored `enumerate` to execute a single batched remote script defined in `_enumeration_plan.py`, reducing round trips, capturing stdout/stderr metadata per probe, and persisting both JSON and plain-text survey outputs under the connection log directory.
- Hardened plugin discovery by ensuring `/tmp/lazyssh/plugins` exists with 0700 permissions, repairing missing execute bits on packaged Python plugins when possible, falling back to interpreter execution with warnings, and surfacing validation warnings in `plugin info`.
- Moved command and SCP history files to `/tmp/lazyssh` with secure permissions and added a `shutil.get_terminal_size` fallback when determining terminal width.

### Tests
- Coverage for env/user directory discovery, precedence, and non-existent dirs
- Validation that runtime sets exec bit on packaged plugins
- Added targeted coverage for plugin manager permission repair, directory precedence, runtime directory provisioning, and warning propagation.
- Added unit tests exercising the enumeration priority findings pipeline and JSON payload structure.

### Documentation
- Reworked user documentation with a streamlined README plus new `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/reference.md`, `docs/guides.md`, and `docs/maintainers.md`, alongside refreshed troubleshooting guidance aligned with the updated workflows.

  - The `wizard` command provides similar guided experience to the old prompt mode
  - All existing command mode functionality remains unchanged


## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-12

### Added

## [1.3.5] - 2025-10-12

### Added
- **SCP Mode Performance Optimizations**: Implemented intelligent caching and throttling system
  - Directory listing cache with configurable 30-second TTL reduces redundant SSH commands
  - Completion throttling (300ms delay) limits query frequency during rapid typing
  - Cache automatically invalidates on directory changes (`cd`, `put` commands)
  - Expected 80-90% reduction in SSH commands during typical completion workflows
  - Cache-first strategy for both `ls` and `find` commands
- **Debug Command in SCP Mode**: Added `debug` command to toggle debug logging on/off at runtime
  - Consistent behavior with command mode debug toggle
  - Accepts optional argument for explicit control (`debug on`, `debug off`)
  - No restart required to enable/disable verbose logging
  - Debug logs always saved to `/tmp/lazyssh/logs` regardless of debug mode state

### Changed
- **Documentation Modernization**: Comprehensive update to all documentation files
  - Simplified README.md with focus on quick start and essential features
  - Restructured user-guide.md as streamlined user journey (installation → first connection → workflows)

- Reduced network traffic during file path completion
- More responsive user experience during rapid typing in SCP mode


## [1.3.4] - 2025-10-11

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Removed native Windows support
  - Windows OpenSSH does not support SSH control sockets (master mode `-M` flag) which is essential for LazySSH's persistent connection functionality
  - Windows users should use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run LazySSH with full functionality
  - Documentation updated to reflect WSL requirement for Windows users
  - Platform support now officially limited to Linux and macOS

### Fixed
- Fixed SCP mode connection when no arguments provided
  - Running `scp` without arguments now correctly enters SCP mode after connection selection
  - Previously, socket path was not set after interactive connection selection, causing immediate exit
  - Existing behavior when connection is provided as argument remains unchanged


## [1.3.3] - 2025-10-11

### Added
- Terminal method can now be changed at runtime without restarting LazySSH
  - Added `terminal <method>` command in command mode to set terminal method (auto, native, terminator)
  - Terminal method now displayed in SSH connections status table
- State management for terminal method preference in SSHManager class
- New `open` command for opening terminal sessions, creating symmetry with the `close` command

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Native terminal mode now uses subprocess instead of os.execvp()
  - Users can now exit SSH sessions (with `exit` or Ctrl+D) and return to LazySSH
  - LazySSH process remains running while native terminal is open
  - SSH connection remains active after closing terminal session
  - This allows managing multiple sessions and switching between connections
- **BREAKING:** Split `terminal` command functionality into two separate commands:
  - `open <ssh_id>` - Opens a terminal session (replaces `terminal <ssh_id>`)
  - `terminal <method>` - Changes terminal method only (auto, native, terminator)
  - This provides clearer command separation and better user experience
- `open_terminal_native()` now returns boolean (True/False) instead of None
- `open_terminal()` now returns boolean indicating success/failure
- Updated help text and documentation to reflect new command structure
- Tab completion now context-aware: `terminal` suggests methods only, `open` suggests connections only

### Migration Notes
- **IMPORTANT:** The `terminal <ssh_id>` command for opening terminals has been replaced with `open <ssh_id>`
  - Old: `terminal myserver` → New: `open myserver`
  - If you use the old syntax, LazySSH will show a helpful error message guiding you to use `open`
  - The `terminal` command now only changes terminal methods: `terminal native`, `terminal auto`, `terminal terminator`
- Users who relied on native mode exiting LazySSH will now return to LazySSH instead
- To exit LazySSH completely, use the exit menu option or command
- All existing functionality remains compatible except for the command name change above

## [1.3.2] - 2025-10-11

### Changed
- Terminator is now a truly optional dependency
  - Application no longer exits if Terminator is not installed

  - Terminator is optional (falls back to native mode)
