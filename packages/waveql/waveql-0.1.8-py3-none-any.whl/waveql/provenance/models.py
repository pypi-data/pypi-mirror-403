"""
Provenance Data Models - Core data structures for query lineage tracking.

This module defines the immutable data structures that represent provenance
information captured during query execution.

Research Context:
    These models implement the three types of provenance from database literature:
    - Where-Provenance (Buneman et al., 2001): Source of each data item
    - Why-Provenance: Predicates that caused inclusion
    - How-Provenance: Transformations applied

        Per-row provenance is only captured in "full" or "sampled" mode
