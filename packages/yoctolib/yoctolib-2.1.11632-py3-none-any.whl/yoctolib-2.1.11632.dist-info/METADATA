## Using the local copy of the library

The examples in directory Examples refer to the library as ``yoctolib.yocto_xxxx``.
In order to allow your Python environment to locate the library in this directory 
rather than having to install it from PyPI, run the following command in *this* directory:
````
pip install -e .
````
This will result in linking in your *local packages* this local copy of the library.
To undo this operation, simply run
````
pip uninstall yoctolib
````

## Using PyPI package

This source code is also published on PyPI (the Python Package Index)
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/yoctolib

To install it from PyPI, simply run the pip install command like this
````
pip install yoctolib
````

If you already have the library installed from PyPI you can upgrade it with the following command:
````
pip install -U yoctolib
````
