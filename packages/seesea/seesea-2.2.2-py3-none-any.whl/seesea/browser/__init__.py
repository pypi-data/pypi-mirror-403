Browser automation package for SeeSea

This package provides comprehensive browser automation support for search engines
that require JavaScript rendering. It includes:

- Base classes for implementing custom browser engines
- Specialized engines for specific websites (e.g., Xinhua News)
- High-level client for easy integration
- Type-safe interfaces with full type annotations

Architecture:
    browser/
    ├── __init__.py      # Package exports and convenience imports
    ├── base.py          # Base classes and interfaces
    └── xinhua.py        # Xinhua News engine implementation

Usage Patterns:

1. Using the high-level client (recommended):
    >>> from seesea.browser import BrowserEngineClient, XinhuaEngine
    >>>
    >>> client = BrowserEngineClient()
    >>> results = await client.execute_search(
    ...     XinhuaEngine,
    ...     url="https://so.news.cn/#search/0/AI/1",
    ...     actions=[{"type": "wait", "ms": 3000}],
    ...     params={"query": "AI", "max_results": 20}
    ... )

2. Using engine directly with context manager:
    >>> from seesea.browser import XinhuaEngine, BrowserConfig
    >>>
    >>> config = BrowserConfig(headless=True, stealth=True)
    >>> async with XinhuaEngine(config) as engine:
    ...     results = await engine.search_xinhua("科技", page=1)

3. Creating custom engines:
    >>> from seesea.browser import BaseBrowserEngine, BrowserConfig
    >>>
    >>> class MyEngine(BaseBrowserEngine):
    ...     async def extract_data(self, page, params):
    ...         # Custom extraction logic
    ...         elements = await page.locator("a.result").all()
    ...         return [
    ...             {"title": await e.text_content(), "url": await e.get_attribute("href")}
    ...             for e in elements
    ...         ]

Performance Considerations:
- Browser instances are created lazily and reused when possible
- Context managers ensure proper resource cleanup
- Singleton browser instance per engine (configurable)
- Efficient deduplication using sets
- Selector strategies ordered by reliability

Type Safety:
All public APIs include complete type annotations for improved IDE support
and type checking with mypy.
