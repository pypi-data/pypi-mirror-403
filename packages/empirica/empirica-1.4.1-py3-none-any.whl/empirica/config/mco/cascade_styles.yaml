# NOTES FOR SENTINEL ORCHESTRATOR
# =============================================================================
#
# Profile Selection Logic (recommended):
#   1. Task Type:
#      - Research/exploration → exploratory
#      - Production bug fix → rigorous
#      - Prototype/spike → rapid
#      - Learning task → novice
#   
#   2. AI Capability:
#      - High-performing AI + complex task → expert
#      - New AI + simple task → novice
#      - Standard capability → default
#   
#   3. Project Phase:
#      - Early exploration → exploratory
#      - Pre-release → rigorous
#      - Sprint work → default
#   
#   4. Custom Overrides:
#      - Sentinel can load base profile + override specific thresholds
#      - Example: exploratory + cascade.max_investigation_rounds=5
#
# Handoff Behavior:
#   - Model A executes with profile_A thresholds
#   - Handoff includes: epistemic_state ($\vec{E}$), not thresholds
#   - Sentinel reloads profile_B for Model B based on its capabilities
#   - This allows optimal threshold tuning per model
#
