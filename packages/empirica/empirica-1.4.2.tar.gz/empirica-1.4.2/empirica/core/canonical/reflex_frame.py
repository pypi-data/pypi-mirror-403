"""
Canonical Reflex Frame Data Structures

Core types for Empirica epistemic framework.
Main assessment schema moved to empirica.core.schemas.epistemic_assessment

Key Principle: epistemic weights ≠ internal weights
We measure knowledge state, we don't modify model parameters.

Design:
- ENGAGEMENT as structural gate (≥0.60 required)
- Canonical weights: 35/25/25/15 (foundation/comprehension/execution/engagement)
- No heuristics, no confabulation - genuine LLM reasoning only
