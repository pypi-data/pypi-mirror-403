"""StageInputs - Immutable view of prior stage outputs available to a stage.

This module defines StageInputs, an immutable dataclass that provides stages with
access to the original ContextSnapshot and outputs from declared dependency stages.
This replaces the mutable shared state pattern (ctx.config["data"]).

Key Principles:
- Immutable: frozen=True prevents accidental mutation
- Explicit: Only declared dependency outputs are accessible
- Validated: Strict mode raises errors for undeclared dependencies
- Typed: StageOutput is already a frozen dataclass with typed fields

Example:
    # Stage receives StageInputs in its context
    async def execute(self, ctx: StageContext) -> StageOutput:
        inputs: StageInputs = ctx.inputs

        # From original snapshot
        user_id = inputs.snapshot.user_id

        # From specific prior stage (strict - only declared deps)
        transcript = inputs.get_from("stt_stage", "transcript")

        # Search all prior outputs for a key
        transcript = inputs.get("transcript")

        # Services through ports (typed, explicit)
        await inputs.ports.send_status("stt", "started", None)
