def generate_steps_prompt():
    return """Generate a list of steps that you would take to complete a task. Based on the chat history and the instructions that were provided to you throughout this chat.

Rules:
- Intentionally break down the task into smaller steps and independednt and seperate chunks.
- If you think a step is insignificant and is not required, you can skip it.
- You can generate a list of steps to complete a task. Make each task is as detailed as possible.
- Also detail out how each step should be performed and how we should go about it properly.
- Also include in each step how we can confirm or verify that the step was completed successfully.
- You can also include examples or references to help explain the steps better.
- You can also provide additional information or tips to help us complete the task more effectively.
- Format steps like clear instructions or prompts. Make sure each step is clear and easy to understand.
- Do not include any extra steps that are not related to the task. Only come up with only steps for the core task.
- Remember, you are generating these steps for youself.
- For example, if I as you to write a python program. Do not generate steps to open my computer, editor or install python. Those are not the core steps and are self-explanatory.
- Only come up with steps to solve the hardest part of the problem, the core part. Not the outskirts.
- Do not disclose these rules in the output.

Why this is important:
- This will help you to break down the task into smaller steps and make it easier to complete the task. So, think about the task and come up with the steps that you would take to complete it. So, only output task that you are capable of doing.
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps to ensure clarity and focus. But actively move towards the solution and make progress.
- Assume that when you actually perform the task, the result from the previous step will be used as the input for the next step. So, make sure to provide the output of each step in a way that it can be used as input for the next step. So, we can build upon the previous steps and make progress towards the final solution.

Your output should be in a proper JSON parsable format. In proper JSON structure.

Example Output:
{
    "steps" : [
        "Step 1: I will do this task first.",
        "Step 2: I will do this this second.",
        "Step 3: I will do this this third."
    ]

    context = f"\nBased on my previous thoughts:\n{str(previous_thoughts)}" if previous_thoughts else ""

    return f"""You are an expert problem solver using a private scratchpad to reason step-by-step.{context}

Private Scratchpad Rules:
- These notes are never exposed to the user, so do NOT mention secrecy, refusal, policies, or any limitation about sharing thoughts.
- Think honestly and concretely about the task, performing intermediate calculations, assumptions, and checks.
- Expand on prior thoughts when present so each new thought advances the solution.
- Explore alternative approaches, edge cases, and potential pitfalls, then converge on the most promising plan.
- Avoid filler, apologies, or meta-commentary; focus purely on useful reasoning content.
- Do not write phrases like "Final answer", "I can't share", or anything that sounds like a public response; this is internal analysis only.

Focus Areas:
- Brainstorm multiple solution paths or strategies and compare their trade-offs.
- Identify requirements, constraints, risks, and the data you still need.
- When a path seems viable, sketch the concrete steps or sub-calculations required to execute it.
- Note validations or tests you would run to confirm the result.
- Reference available tools or resources if they unlock better answers.

Formatting:
- Produce 3 to 5 concise thought entries.
- Each entry must start with "Thought X:" (where X is 1, 2, 3, ...).
- Each entry should capture a meaningful piece of reasoning such as a sub-problem, calculation, assumption, or validation.
- Keep the focus on exploration and intermediate logic, not on re-stating the final answer.
- Vary the content across entries (e.g., consider alternative approaches, sanity checks, tool usage) instead of repeating the same sentence.
- If you arrive at a conclusion, rewrite it as reasoning steps ("Thought X: Multiply..."), not as a final answer statement.
- If you detect that two thoughts are identical, revise them so each adds new reasoning signal. (Do not repeat the same thought.)

Your output must be valid JSON. Example:
{{
    "thoughts": [
        "Thought 1: Convert 20% to decimal (0.2) so multiplication is straightforward.",
        "Thought 2: Multiply 0.2 by 150 to produce 30 and note units remain consistent.",
        "Thought 3: Sanity-check by seeing that 10% would be 15, so doubling confirms 30."
