                               Version 3, 29 June 2007
        
         Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
                                    Preamble
        
          The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
        software and other kinds of works.
        
          The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
        to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
        the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
        share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
        software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
        GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
        any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
        your programs, too.
        
          When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
        them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
        want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
        free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
        
          To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
        you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
        
          For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
        gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
        freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
        or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
        know their rights.
        
          Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
        
          For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
        that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
        authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
        changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
        authors of previous versions.
        
          Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
        modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
        can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
        protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
        pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
        use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
        have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
        products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
        stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
        of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
        
          Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
        avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
        make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
        patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
        
          The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.
        
                               TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
          0. Definitions.
        
          "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
        
          "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
        works, such as semiconductor masks.
        
          "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
        License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
        "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
        
          To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
        in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
        exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
        earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
        
          A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
        on the Program.
        
          To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
        permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
        infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
        computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
        distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
        public, and in some countries other activities as well.
        
          To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
        parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
        a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
        
          An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
        to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
        feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
        tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
        extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
        work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
        the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
        menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
        
          1. Source Code.
        
          The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
        for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
        form of a work.
        
          A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
        standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
        interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
        is widely used among developers working in that language.
        
          The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
        than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
        packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
        Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
        Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
        implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
        "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
        (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
        (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
        produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
        
          The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
        the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
        work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
        control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
        System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
        programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
        which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
        includes interface definition files associated with source files for
        the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
        linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
        such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
        subprograms and other parts of the work.
        
          The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
        can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
        Source.
        
          The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
        same work.
        
          2. Basic Permissions.
        
          All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
        copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
        conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
        permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
        covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
        content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
        rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
        
          You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
        convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
        in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
        of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
        with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
        the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
        not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
        for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
        and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
        your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
        
          Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
        the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
        makes it unnecessary.
        
          3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
        
          No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
        measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
        11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
        similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
        measures.
        
          When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
        circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
        is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
        the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
        modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
        users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
        technological measures.
        
          4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
        
          You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
        receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
        appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
        keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
        non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
        keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
        recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
        
          You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
        and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
        
          5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
        
          You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
        produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
        terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
        
            a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
            it, and giving a relevant date.
        
            b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
            released under this License and any conditions added under section
            7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
            "keep intact all notices".
        
            c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
            License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
            License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
            additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
            regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
            permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
            invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
        
            d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
            Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
            interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
            work need not make them do so.
        
          A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
        works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
        and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
        in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
        "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
        used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
        beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
        in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
        parts of the aggregate.
        
          6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
        
          You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
        of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
        machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
        in one of these ways:
        
            a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
            Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
            customarily used for software interchange.
        
            b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
            written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
            long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
            model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
            copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
            product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
            medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
            more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
            conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
            Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
        
            c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
            written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
            alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
            only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
            with subsection 6b.
        
            d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
            place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
            Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
            further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
            Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
            copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
            may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
            that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
            clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
            Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
            Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
            available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
        
            e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
            you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
            Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
            charge under subsection 6d.
        
          A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
        from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
        included in conveying the object code work.
        
          A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
        tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
        or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
        into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
        doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
        product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
        typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
        of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
        actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
        is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
        commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
        the only significant mode of use of the product.
        
          "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
        procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
        and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
        a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
        suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
        code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
        modification has been made.
        
          If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
        specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
        part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
        User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
        fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
        Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
        by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
        if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
        modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
        been installed in ROM).
        
          The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
        requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
        for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
        the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
        network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
        adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
        protocols for communication across the network.
        
          Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
        in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
        documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
        source code form), and must require no special password or key for
        unpacking, reading or copying.
        
          7. Additional Terms.
        
          "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
        License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
        Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
        be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
        that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
        apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
        under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
        this License without regard to the additional permissions.
        
          When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
        remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
        it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
        removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
        additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
        for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
        
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
        add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
        that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
        
            a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
            terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
        
            b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
            author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
            Notices displayed by works containing it; or
        
            c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
            requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
            reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
        
            d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
            authors of the material; or
        
            e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
            trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
        
            f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
            material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
            it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
            any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
            those licensors and authors.
        
          All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
        restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
        received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
        governed by this License along with a term that is a further
        restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
        a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
        License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
        of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
        not survive such relicensing or conveying.
        
          If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
        must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
        additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
        where to find the applicable terms.
        
          Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
        form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
        the above requirements apply either way.
        
          8. Termination.
        
          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
        provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
        modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
        this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
        paragraph of section 11).
        
          However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
        license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
        provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
        finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
        holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
        prior to 60 days after the cessation.
        
          Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
        reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
        violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
        received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
        copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
        your receipt of the notice.
        
          Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
        licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
        this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
        reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
        material under section 10.
        
          9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
        
          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
        run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
        occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
        to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
        nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
        modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
        not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
        covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
        
          10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
        
          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
        receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
        propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
        for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
        
          An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
        organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
        organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
        work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
        transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
        licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
        give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
        Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
        the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
        
          You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
        rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
        not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
        rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
        any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
        sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
        
          11. Patents.
        
          A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
        License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
        work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
        
          A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
        owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
        hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
        by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
        but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
        consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
        purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
        patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
        this License.
        
          Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
        patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
        make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
        propagate the contents of its contributor version.
        
          In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
        agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
        (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
        sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
        party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
        patent against the party.
        
          If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
        and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
        to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
        publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
        then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
        available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
        patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
        consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
        license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
        actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
        covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
        in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
        country that you have reason to believe are valid.
        
          If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
        arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
        covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
        receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
        or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
        you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
        work and works based on it.
        
          A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
        the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
        conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
        specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
        work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
        in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
        to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
        the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
        parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
        patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
        conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
        for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
        contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
        or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
        
          Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
        any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
        otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
        
          12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
        
          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
        excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
        covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
        License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
        not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
        to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
        the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
        License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
        
          13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
        
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
        permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
        under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
        combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
        License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
        but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
        section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
        combination as such.
        
          14. Revised Versions of this License.
        
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
        the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
        be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
        address new problems or concerns.
        
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
        Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
        Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
        option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
        version or of any later version published by the Free Software
        Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
        GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
        by the Free Software Foundation.
        
          If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
        versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
        public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
        to choose that version for the Program.
        
          Later license versions may give you additional or different
        permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
        author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
        later version.
        
          15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
        
          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
        APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
        OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
        THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
        IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
        ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        
          16. Limitation of Liability.
        
          IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
        THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
        GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
        USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
        DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
        PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
        EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
        SUCH DAMAGES.
        
          17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
        
          If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
        above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
        reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
        an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
        Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
        copy of the Program in return for a fee.
        
                             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
        
          If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
        possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
        free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
        
          To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
        
            <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
            Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
        
            This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
            it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
            the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
            (at your option) any later version.
        
            This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
            but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
            MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
            GNU General Public License for more details.
        
            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
            along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
        
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
        
          If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
        notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
        
            <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
            This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
            This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
            under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
        
        The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
        parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
        might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
        
          You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
        if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
        For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
        <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
        
          The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
        into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
        may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
        the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
        Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
        <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

The wonderful 'dar' [Disk Archiver](https://github.com/Edrusb/DAR) is used for
the heavy lifting, together with the [parchive](https://github.com/Parchive/par2cmdline) suite in these scripts.

This is the `Python` based [**version 2**](v2) of `dar-backup`.

You can see the [v2 Changelog](v2/Changelog.md) for details on features and progress.

## TL;DR

`dar-backup` is a Python-powered CLI for creating and validating full, differential, and incremental backups using `dar` and `par2`. Designed for long-term restore integrity, even on user-space filesystems like FUSE.

Version **1.0.0** was reached on October 9, 2025.

## My use case

I needed the following:

- Backup my workstation to a remote server
- Backup primarily photos, home made video and different types of documents
- I have cloud storage mounted on a directory within my home dir. The filesystem is [FUSE based](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html), which gives it a few special features

  - Backup my cloud storage (cloud is convenient, but I want control over my backups)
  - A non-privileged user can perform a mount
  - A privileged user cannot look into the filesystem --> a backup script running as root is not suitable

- Have a simple way of restoring, possibly years into the future. 'dar' fits that scenario with a single statically linked binary (kept with the archives). There is no need install/configure anything - restoring is simple and works well.
- During backup archives must be tested and a restore test (however small) performed
- Archives stored on a server with a reliable file system (easy to mount a directory over sshfs)
- Easy to verify archive's integrity, after being moved around.

 I do not need the encryption features of dar, as all storage is already encrypted.

## My setup

1. Primary backup to server with an ext4 file system on mdadm RAID1

2. Secondary copies to multiple USB disks / cloud

3. Archive integrity verification anywhere using [Par2](#par2) and `dar -t`.

4. Archive repair anywhere if needed. By default `dar-backup` creates par2 redundancy files with 5% coverage. Enough to fix localized bitrot.

5. No dependency on original system

### Why PAR2 is especially good for portable / offsite copies

PAR2 parity is:

> Self-contained (travels with the data)
>
>Format-agnostic (works on any filesystem)
>
>Location-agnostic (local disk, USB, cloud object storage)
>
>Tool-stable (PAR2 spec has not changed in years)
>
>That means:
>
>**Integrity protection moves with the archive**.

### Design choices

My design choices are boring, proven and pragmatic:
>
>mdadm handles disks
>
>PAR2 handles data integrity
>
>You control when and how verification happens
>
>Errors have a fair chance of being diagnosed and fixed, due to well known tooling.
>
>No hidden magic, no lock-in

## Features

- The battle tested [dar](https://github.com/Edrusb/DAR) Disk Archiver is used for the actual backups - it comes highly recommended.
- Backup with test of backup and (configurable) restore tests of files with comparison to source
- [Redundancy files](#par2) created for patching bitrot of the archives (size configurable)
- Simple [backup definitions](#backup-definition-example) defining what to backup (as many as you need)
- [Backup catalogs](#dar-manager-databases) in databases, optionally on a disk different from the backups
- Flexible and precise logging
- Bash and zsh shell autocompletion for a nice CLI experience, [available completions](#shell-autocompletion):
  
  - Options for `dar-backup`, `cleanup`, `manager`
  - Backup definitions
  - Archives - filtered to backup definition if given
  - Catalogs - filtered to backup definition if given

- `dar-backup` is easy to install and configure.

- ✅ The author has used dar-backup since > 4 years, and has been saved multiple times.

## Quick Guide

This purpose of this quick guide is to show how `dar-backup` works in a few simple steps.

The package include a `demo`application, that can help you set up `dar-backup` quickly.

> ⚠️ **Assumption**
>
> The demo program uses these directories in your home directory:
>
> - $HOME/dar-backup
> - $HOME/.config/dar-backup
>
> It is assumed they **do not exist** before running the demo.
>
> Python **>= 3.9** is required

## Status
**1.0.0 milestone reached**

October 9, 2025, I have promoted version 0.8.4 --> **1.0.0** after having added more test cases and seen no issues with 0.8.4.

As of February 13, 2025, I have changed the status from alpha --> beta, as the featureset is in place and the alphas have worked well for a very long time.

As of August 8, 2024 I am using the alpha versions of `dar-backup` (alpha-0.5.9 onwards) in my automated backup routine.

<summary>🎯 Where to Find Release Signatures</summary>

PyPI does *Not* host .asc Signature Files

Although the `dar-backup` packages on PyPI are GPG-signed, PyPI itself does **not support uploading** .asc detached signature files alongside `.whl` and `.tar.gz` artifacts.

Therefore, you will not find `.asc` files on PyPI.

**Where to Get `.asc` Signature Files**

You can always download the signed release artifacts and their `.asc` files from the official GitHub Releases page:

📁 GitHub Releases for `dar-backup`

Each release includes:

- `dar_backup-x.y.z.tar.gz`

- `dar_backup-x.y.z.tar.gz.asc`

- `dar_backup-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl`

- `dar_backup-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl.asc`

</details>

<br>

<details>

<summary>🎯 How to Verify a Release from GitHub</summary>

1. Import the GPG public key:

   ```bash
   curl https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/4592D7396DBAEFFD084502B85CCEC7E16814A36E | gpg --import
   ```

2. Download the wheel or tarball and its .asc signature from the GitHub.

3. Run GPG to verify it:

   ```bash
   gpg --verify dar_backup-x.y.z.tar.gz.asc dar_backup-x.y.z.tar.gz
   # or
   gpg --verify dar_backup-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl.asc dar_backup-x.y.z-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

4. If the signature is valid, you'll see:

   ```text
   gpg: Good signature from "Per Jensen (author of dar-backup) <dar-backup@pm.me>"
   ```

🛡️ Reminder: Verify the signing subkey

Only this subkey is used to sign PyPI packages:

```text

## dar-backup principles

### dar-backup overview

[![dar-backup overview](v2/doc/dar-backup-overview-small.png)](v2/doc/dar-backup-overview.png)

### dar-backup

`dar-backup` is built in a way that emphasizes getting backups. It loops over the [backup definitions](#backup-definition-example), and in the event of a failure while backing up a backup definition, dar-backup shall log an error and start working on the next backup definition.

There are 3 levels of backups, FULL, DIFF and INCR.

- The author does a FULL yearly backup once a year. This includes all files in all directories as defined in the backup definition(s) (assuming `-d` was not given).
- The author makes a DIFF once a month. The DIFF backs up new and changed files **compared** to the **FULL** backup.

  - No DIFF backups are taken until a FULL backup has been taken for a particular backup definition.

- The author takes an INCR backup every 3 days. An INCR backup includes new and changed files **compared** to the **DIFF** backup.
  
  - So, a set of INCR's will contain duplicates (this might change as I become more used to use the catalog databases)
  
  - No INCR backups are taken until a DIFF backup has been taken for a particular backup definition.

After each backup of a backup definition, `dar-backup` tests the archive and then performs a few restore operations of random files from the archive (see [dar-backup.conf](#config-file)). The restored files are compared to the originals to check if the restore went well.

`dar-backup` skips doing a backup of a backup definition if an archive is already in place. So, if you for some reason need to take a new backup on the same date, the first archive must be deleted (I recommend using [cleanup](#cleanup-1)).

### cleanup

The `cleanup` application deletes DIFF and INCR if the archives are older than the thresholds set up in the configuration file.

`cleanup` will only remove FULL archives if the option  `--cleanup-specific-archives` is used. It requires the user to confirm deletion of FULL archives.

Use `--dry-run` to preview which archives, PAR2 files, and catalogs would be removed without deleting anything.

Examples:

```bash
cleanup --dry-run -d media-files --log-stdout
cleanup --dry-run --cleanup-specific-archives -d media-files media-files_INCR_2025-12-22
```

### manager

`dar`has the concept of catalogs which can be exported and optionally be added to a catalog database. That database makes it much easier to restore the correct version of a backed up file if for example a target date has been set.

`dar-backup` adds archive catalogs to their databases (using the `manager` script). Should the operation fail, `dar-backup` logs an error and continue with testing and restore validation tests.

## How to run

📦 All official dar-backup releases from v2-beta-0.6.18 are signed with GPG.

See more [here](#gpg-signing-key).

### 1 - installation

Installation is currently in a [virtual environment](https://csguide.cs.princeton.edu/software/virtualenv) (commonly called a `venv`). These commands are installed in the venv:

- dar-back
- cleanup
- manager
- clean-log
- dar-backup-systemd
- installer
- demo

Note:

The modules `inputimeout`, `rich`and `argcomplete` are installed into the venv and used by `dar-backup`

To install `dar-backup`, create a venv and run pip:

```bash
mkdir $HOME/tmp
cd $HOME/tmp
python3 -m venv venv    # create the virtual environment 
. venv/bin/activate     # activate the virtual environment
pip install dar-backup  # run pip to install `dar-backup`
```

I have an alias in ~/.bashrc pointing to my venv:

```bash
alias db=". ~/tmp/venv/bin/activate; dar-backup -v"
```

drop the alias into ~/.bashrc like this:

```bash
grep -qxF 'alias db="' ~/.bashrc \
  || echo 'alias db=". ~/tmp/venv/bin/activate; dar-backup -v"' >> ~/.bashrc

source ~/.bashrc
```

Typing `db` at the command line gives something like this:

```bash
(venv) user@machine:~$ db
dar-backup 0.6.12
dar-backup.py source code is here: https://github.com/per2jensen/dar-backup
Licensed under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3, see the supplied file "LICENSE" for details.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
See section 15 and section 16 in the supplied "LICENSE" file.
```

### 2 - configuration

The dar-backup [installer](#installer-options) application can be used to setup the needed directories for `dar-backup` to work.
It creates necessary directories as prescribed in the config file and optionally creates manager databases.

`installer` can also add configuration of shell auto completion.

Step 1:

Create a config file   - [see details on config file](#config-file))

Step 2:

Create one or more backup definitions - [see details on backup definitions](#backup-definition-example)

Step 3:

Run the installer:

```bash
installer --config <path to dar-backup.conf> --install-autocompletion
```

### 3 - generate catalog databases

Generate the archive catalog database(s).

`dar-backup` expects the catalog databases to be in place, it does not automatically create them (by design)

```bash
manager --create-db
```

### 4 - give dar-backup a spin

You are now ready to do backups as configured in your backup definition(s).

Give `dar-backup`a spin:

```bash
dar-backup --full-backup --verbose

# list backups
dar-backup --list

# list contents of a dar backup
dar-backup --list-contents <TAB>... <choose a backup>

# see some examples on usage
dar-backup --examples

# see the log file
cat "$HOME/dar-backup/dar-backup.log"
```

If you want to see dar-backup's log entries in the terminal, use the `--log-stdout` option.

If you want more log messages, use the `--verbose` or `--log-level debug` for even more.

If you want to take a backup using a single backup definition, use the `-d <backup definition>` option. The backup definition's name is the filename of the definition in the BACKUP.D_DIR (see [config file](#config-file)).

```bash
dar-backup --full-backup -d <your backup definition>
```

### 5 - deactivate venv

Deactivate the virtual environment (venv).

```bash
deactivate
```

## Config

### Config file

The configuration file's default location is: ~/.config/dar-backup/dar-backup.conf

If you have your config file somewhere else, use the `--config-file` option to point to it.

Tilde `~` and environment variables can be used in the paths for various file locations.

```text
[MISC]

PAR2 notes:

- If `PAR2_DIR` is unset, par2 files are created next to the archive slices (legacy behavior) and no manifest is written
- When `PAR2_DIR` is set, dar-backup writes a manifest next to the par2 set:
  `archive_base.par2.manifest.ini`
- When generating a par2 set, par2 reads all archive slices before writing any output files; for large backups, this initial read can take hours
- Verify or repair using:
  `par2 verify -B <archive_dir> <par2_set.par2>`
  `par2 repair -B <archive_dir> <par2_set.par2>`

### .darrc

The package includes a default `darrc` file which configures `dar`.

You can override the default `.darrc` using the `--darrc` option.

The default `.darrc` contents are as follows:

```text
#  .darrc configuration file for `dar` as used by the `dar-backup` script.

### Backup definition example

This piece of configuration is a [backup definition](#backup-definition-example). It is placed in the BACKUP.D_DIR (see config file description).
The name of the file is the name of the backup definition.

You can use as many backup definitions as you need.

## Generate systemd files

The command `dar-backup-systemd` can generate and optionally install systemd units and timers.

The timers are set as the author uses them, modify to your taste and needs.

Example run:

```bash
dar-backup-systemd --venv /home/user/tmp/venv --dar-path /home/user/.local/dar/bin
Generated dar-full-backup.service and dar-full-backup.timer
  → Fires on: *-12-30 10:03:00
Generated dar-diff-backup.service and dar-diff-backup.timer
  → Fires on: *-*-01 19:03:00
Generated dar-incr-backup.service and dar-incr-backup.timer
  → Fires on: *-*-04/3 19:03:00
Generated dar-clean.service and dar-clean.timer
  → Fires on: *-*-* 21:07:00
```

## Systemctl examples

I have dar-backup scheduled to run via systemd --user settings.

The files are located in: ~/.config/systemd/user

Once the .service and .timer files are in place, timers must be enabled and started.

```` bash
systemctl --user enable dar-inc-backup.timer
systemctl --user start  dar-inc-backup.timer
systemctl --user daemon-reload
````

Verify your timers are set up as you want:

```bash
systemctl --user list-timers
```

## Service: dar-backup --incremental-backup

This is an example of a systemd user service unit.

File:  dar-incr-backup.service

```bash
/tmp/test$ dar-backup-systemd --venv '$HOME/programmer/dar-backup.py/venv'  --dar-path '$HOME/.local/dar/bin'

Generated dar-full-backup.service and dar-full-backup.timer
  → Fires on: *-12-30 10:03:00
Generated dar-diff-backup.service and dar-diff-backup.timer
  → Fires on: *-*-01 19:03:00
Generated dar-incr-backup.service and dar-incr-backup.timer
  → Fires on: *-*-04/3 19:03:00
Generated dar-cleanup.service and dar-cleanup.timer
  → Fires on: *-*-* 21:07:00
/tmp/test$ 
(venv) /tmp/test$ 
(venv) /tmp/test$ cat dar-incr-backup.service 
[Unit]

RemainAfterExit=no


ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'PATH=$HOME/.local/dar/bin:$PATH && . $HOME/programmer/dar-backup.py/venv/bin/activate && dar-backup -I --verbose --log-stdout'
```

## Timer: dar-backup --incremental-backup

This is an example of a systemd user timer

File:  dar-incr-backup.timer

```text
[Unit]
Description=dar-backup INCR timer

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-04/3 19:03:00
Persistent=true

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

## systemd timer note

📅 OnCalendar syntax is flexible — you can tweak backup schedules easily. Run systemd-analyze calendar to preview timers.

## list contents of an archive

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment
source <the virtual evn>/bin/activate
dar-backup --list-contents media-files_INCR_2025-05-10
# Deactivate when done
deactivate
```

gives something like

## dar file selection examples

> ⚠️ **Quoting matters**
>
> Always pass `--selection` as `--selection="-I '*.NEF'"` to ensure it’s treated as a single argument.
>
> Avoid splitting `--selection` and the string into separate tokens.

**Why does --selection give “expected one argument” error?**

This happens when the shell splits the quoted string or interprets globs before `dar-backup` sees them.  
✅ Use:   `--selection="-I '*.NEF'"`  
❌ Avoid: `--selection "-I '*.NEF'"`  

> 💡 **Tip:** See [dar's documentation](http://dar.linux.free.fr/doc/man/dar.html#COMMANDS%20AND%20OPTIONS)

>
> 💡💡 **Tip:** To filter all the empty directories away that `dar` emits when listing  contents, append this grep:

## Restoring

### default location for restores

dar-backup will use the TEST_RESTORE_DIR location as the Root for restores, if the --restore-dir option has not been supplied.

See example below to see where files are restored to.

### --restore-dir option

When the --restore-dir option is used for restoring, a directory must be supplied.

The directory supplied functions as the Root of the restore operation.

**Example**:

A backup has been taken using this backup definition:

```text
-R /
-g home/user/Documents
```

When restoring and using `/tmp` for --restore-dir, the restored files can be found in `/tmp/home/user/Documents`

### a single file

```bash
. <the virtual env>/bin/activate
dar-backup --restore <archive_name> --selection="-g path/to/file"
deactivate
```

### a directory

```bash
. <the virtual env>/bin/activate
dar-backup --restore <archive_name> --selection="-g path/to/directory"
deactivate
```

### .NEF from a specific date

The backed up directory contains \*.NEF and \*.xmp files.

Filtering:

- Include files with "2024-06-16" in file name
- Exclude files with file names ending in ".xmp"
- Files must be in directory "home/user/tmp/LUT-play", compared to the file root (`-R`option) in the backup.

```bash
. <the virtual env>/bin/activate
dar-backup --restore <archive_name>  --selection="-I '*2024-06-16*' -X '*.xmp' -g home/user/tmp/LUT-play"
deactivate
```

### restore test fails with exit code 4

`dar` in newer versions emits a question about file ownership, which is "answered" with a "no" via the "-Q" option. That in turn leads to an error code 4.

Thus the dar option `--comparison-field=ignore-owner` has been placed in the supplied [.darrc](#darrc) file (located in the virtual environment where dar-backup is installed).

This causes dar to restore without an error.

It is a good option when using dar as a non-privileged user.

### restore test fails with exit code 5

If exit code 5 is emitted on the restore test, FSA (File System specific Attributes) could be the cause.

That (might) occur if you backup a file stored on one type of filesystem, and restore it on another type.
My home directory is on a btrfs filesystem, while /tmp (for the restore test) is on zfs.

The restore test can result in an exit code 5, due to the different filesystems used. In order to avoid the errors, the option `--fsa-scope none` can be used. That will restult in FSA's not being restored.

If you need to use this option, un-comment it in the [.darrc](#darrc) file (located in the virtual environment where dar-backup is installed)

## Par2

Why keep PAR2 on a different storage device:

- Reduces single-disk failure impact: bitrot on the archive disk does not affect the parity.
- Easier offsite rotation: you can sync only the PAR2 sets to a different failure domain.

Redundancy guidance:

- FULL backups: 10% is a practical default for larger data sets and longer retention.
- DIFF/INCR: 5% is often enough because the delta is smaller and easier to re-create.
- Increase the ratio if the storage is flaky or the backup is hard to re-run.

Rule of thumb table:

| Backup type | Suggested PAR2 ratio | Notes |
|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| FULL        | 10%                  | Longer retention, larger data set |
| DIFF        | 5%                   | Smaller delta |
| INCR        | 5%                   | Smaller delta |

>
>For large, contiguous archives on reliable local storage, 7–8% has proven sufficient in practice; 10% remains a conservative default.
>

Cloud sync / air-gap note:

- Syncing PAR2 sets to a different device or remote store protects against bitrot and small corruption, but it cannot recover a completely lost archive.
- An air-gapped PAR2 store is useful when the archive disk is exposed to ransomware or accidental deletion.

### Par2 to verify/repair

#### Par2 files kept with archives

If PAR2 files are stored next to the archives (legacy per-slice behavior), you can verify like this:

```bash
for file in <archive>*.dar.par2; do
  par2 verify "$file"
done
```

if there are problems with a slice, try to repair it like this:

```bash
  par2 repair <archive>.<slice number>.dar.par2
```

#### Par2 files in separate directory

See [docs on disk layout matters](v2/doc/portable-par2-layout.md)

>Test case proving this flow:
>
>[tests/test_par2_manifest.py](v2/tests/test_par2_manifest.py)

### Par2 create redundancy files

If you have merged archives, you will need to create the .par2 redundency files manually.
Here is an example

```bash
for file in <some-archive>_FULL_yyyy-mm-dd.*; do
  par2 c -r5 -n1 "$file"
done
```

where "c" is create, -r5 is 5% redundency and -n1 is 1 redundency file

If you want to create a single parity set for all slices in an archive:

```bash
par2 create -B <archive_dir> -r5 <par2_dir>/<archive_base>.par2 <archive_dir>/<archive_base>.*.dar
```

**OBSERVE** [docs on disk layout matters](v2/doc/portable-par2-layout.md)


## Points of interest

### Limitations on File Names with Special Characters

`dar-backup` strictly validates all command-line arguments passed to its internal execution engine to protect against command injection and shell-based attacks. As part of this security measure, certain characters are disallowed in user-provided inputs — particularly those that carry special meaning in shell environments:

Disallowed characters include:

```text
\$ & ; | > < ` \n
```

#### Why this matters

When restoring specific files using the --selection argument or similar mechanisms, filenames that contain one or more of these characters (e.g., file_with_currency$.txt) cannot be safely passed as command-line arguments. As a result, attempting to restore such a file by name using the CLI will result in a validation error.

✅ Backups and Restores Still Work

  ✅ These files are still backed up and restored automatically as part of normal FULL, DIFF, or INCR operations.

  ❌ They cannot be explicitly specified for restore using CLI options like --selection="-g path/to/file_with_currency$.txt".

#### Workarounds

If you need to restore such a file:

  Perform a restore of the entire directory using a more general selection (e.g., --selection="-g path/to/parent-directory").

  Manually retrieve the restored file afterward.

##### Restoring Files with Forbidden Characters in Their Names

The DAR Backup system enforces a strict command-line argument sanitizer to improve security and prevent shell injection attacks. As a result, certain characters are **not allowed** in filenames or arguments passed to the CLI, especially during restore operations. This includes characters like:

| Character | Reason Blocked                  |
|----------:|---------------------------------|
| `;`       | Shell command separator         |
| `&`       | Background execution operator   |
| `\|`      | Pipe operator                   |
| `<` / `>` | Redirection operators           |
| `#`       | Shell comment                   |
| `` ` ``   | Command substitution            |
| `"` / `'` | Quoting that may be unbalanced  |

However, **backups of files with such names still work** — they are preserved correctly within the archive. The limitation only applies to **invoking restore commands via the CLI**, where such filenames cannot be safely passed as arguments.

##### Backups: Safe and Fully Functional

Files with special characters in their names **are backed up without issue**. The only issue you might encounter is restoring a file and giving the file name on the command line (with forbidden characters.)

##### Restores via CLI: Limited by Sanitizer

Attempting to restore such files via:

```bash
    dar-backup restore --file "weird#name.txt"
```

...will fail with an error like:

```bash
    Unsafe argument detected: weird#name.txt
```

---

##### Workaround: Use `dar` Directly

You can always restore the file manually using the `dar` command-line utility itself, bypassing any CLI restrictions imposed by the backup tool.

##### Example: Manual Restore Using `dar`

```bash
    dar -x /path/to/backup/example -g "weird#name.txt"
```

Where:

- `/path/to/backup/example` is the base name of the archive (without `.dar`, `.1.dar`, etc.).
- `"weird#name.txt"` is the exact filename with the special character(s).

You may need to quote the argument or escape characters depending on your shell.

---

##### 🧪 How to Locate Files with Forbidden Characters

To search for such files inside the archive:

```bash
    dar -l /path/to/backup/example | grep '[#;<>|&]'
```

This will help you identify files that require manual restoration.

---

#### Summary

- 🚫 Forbidden characters are blocked **only** in CLI arguments to maintain safety.
- ✅ Files containing these characters are **still archived and restorable**.
- 🛠 Use `dar` directly for full manual control when restoring such files.



### Merge FULL with DIFF, creating new FULL

Over time, the DIFF archives become larger and larger. At some point one wishes to create a new FULL archive to do DIFF's on.
One way to do that, is to let dar create a FULL archive from scratch, another is to merge a FULL archive with a DIFF, and from there do DIFF's until they once again gets too large for your taste.

I do backups of my homedir. Here it is shown how a FULL archive is merged with a DIFF, creating a new FULL archive.

```bash
dar --merge user-homedir_FULL_2021-09-12  -A user-homedir_FULL_2021-06-06  -@user-homedir_DIFF_2021-08-29 -s 12G

# test the new FULL archive
dar -t user-homedir_FULL_2021-09-12

# create Par2 redundancy files
for file in user-homedir_FULL_yyyy-mm-dd.*.dar; do
  par2 c -r5 -n1 "$file"
done
```

### dar manager databases

`dar-backup` now saves archive catalogs in dar catalog databases.

This makes it easier to restore to a given date when having many FULL, DIFF and INCR archives.

If the manager does not add an archive to it's catalog database, `dar-backup` will log an error and continue. The important part is verify the archive is usable and continue to other backup definitions.

### Performance tip due to par2

This [dar benchmark page](https://dar.sourceforge.io/doc/benchmark.html) has an interesting note on the slice size.

Slice size should be smaller than available RAM, apparently a large performance hit can be avoided keeping the par2 data in memory.

### .darrc sets -vd -vf (since v0.6.4)

These [.darrc](#darrc) settings make `dar` print the current directory being processed (-vd) and some stats after (-vf)

This is very useful in very long running jobs to get an indication that the backup is proceeding normally.

The `dar` output is streamed to the `dar-backup-commands.log` file.

### Separate log file for command output

Dar-backup's log file is called `dar-backup.log`.

In order to not clutter that log file with the output of commands being run, a new secondary log file has been introduced `dar-backup-commands.log`.

The secondary log file can get quite cluttered, if you want to remove the clutter, run the `clean-log`script with the `--file` option, or simply delete it.

### Trace Logging (Debug details)

To keep the main log file clean while preserving essential debugging information, `dar-backup` creates a separate trace log file (e.g., `dar-backup.trace.log`) alongside the main log.

- **Main Log (`dar-backup.log`)**: Contains clean, human-readable INFO/ERROR messages. Stack traces are suppressed here.
- **Trace Log (`dar-backup.trace.log`)**: Captures ALL messages at `DEBUG` level, including full exception stack traces. Use this file for debugging crashes or unexpected behavior.

You can configure the rotation of this file in `[MISC]`:

```ini
[MISC]
# ... other settings ...
TRACE_LOG_MAX_BYTES = 10485760  # 10 MB default
TRACE_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT = 1      # Keep 1 old trace file (default)
```

### Skipping cache directories

The author uses the `--cache-directory-tagging` option in his [backup definitions](#backup-definition-example).

The effect is that directories with the [CACHEDIR.TAG](https://bford.info/cachedir/) file are not backed up. Those directories contain content fetched from the net, which is of an ephemeral nature and probably not what you want to back up.

If the option is not in the backup definition, the cache directories are backed up as any other.

### Shell autocompletion

The `dar-backup`, `manager`, and `cleanup` scripts now support dynamic Bash tab-completion, making them easier and faster to use.

✅ Features

- Autocomplete for all long options (--config-file, --restore, etc.)

- Dynamic suggestions based on your config:

- --backup-definition shows available definitions from backup.d/

- show relevant archives when a backup definition has been chosen:

  dar-backup: --restore, --list-contents, and --alternate-reference-archive

  cleanup: --cleanup-specific-archives

  manager:  --list-archive-contents, --add-specific-archive (autocomplete those **not* in the catalog database), --remove-specific-archive
  
- Supports paths like ~ and $HOME correctly

#### Use it

Try typing:

```bash
dar-backup --<TAB>
```

You should see all available flags like --full-backup, --restore, etc.

Try completion of backup definition and then list contents:

```bash
    dar-backup --backup-definition <TAB>
    dar-backup -d <the chosen backup-definition> --list-contents <TAB>
```

#### Archive name completion (smart, context-aware)

When using `manager--list-archive-contents`, the tab-completer suggests valid archive names.

The behavior is smart and context-aware:

- If a --backup-definition (-d) is provided, archive suggestions are restricted to that .db catalog.

- If no backup definition is given, the completer will:

  - Scan all .db files in the backup_dir

  - Aggregate archive names across all catalogs

  - Sort results by:

    - Backup name (e.g. pCloudDrive, media-files)

    - Date inside the archive name (e.g. 2025-04-19)

It’s blazing fast and designed for large backup sets.

```bash
# With a backup definition
manager -d pCloudDrive --list-archive-contents <TAB>
# ⤷ Suggests: pCloudDrive_FULL_2025-03-04, pCloudDrive_INCR_2025-04-19, ...

# Without a backup definition
manager --list-archive-contents <TAB>
# ⤷ Suggests: all archives across all known backup definitions
# ⤷ Example: media-files_FULL_2025-01-04, pCloudDrive_INCR_2025-04-19, ...

# Filter by prefix
manager --list-archive-contents media-<TAB>
# ⤷ Suggests: media-files_FULL_2025-01-04, media-files_INCR_2025-02-20, ...
```

#### Enabling Bash completion

Try auto completion in your session:

```bash
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete dar-backup)"
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete cleanup)"
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete manager)"
#complete -o nosort -C 'python -m argcomplete cleanup' cleanup
#complete -o nosort -C 'python -m argcomplete manager' manager
```

To make it persistent across sessions, add this to your ~/.bashrc:

```bash
# Enable autocompletion for dar-backup
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete dar-backup)"
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete cleanup)"
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete manager)"
# This disables bash sorting, so sorting is by <backup definition> and <date>
#complete -o nosort -C 'python -m argcomplete cleanup' cleanup
#complete -o nosort -C 'python -m argcomplete manager' manager
```

If you're using a virtual environment and register-python-argcomplete isn't in your global PATH, use:

```bash
# Enable autocompletion for dar-backup
eval "$($(which register-python-argcomplete) dar-backup)"
eval "$($(which register-python-argcomplete) cleanup)"
eval "$($(which register-python-argcomplete) manager)"

# If it's not working, try reactivating your virtualenv and restarting your terminal.
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Enable Zsh Completion

If you're using Zsh, add this to your .zshrc:

```zsh
autoload -U bashcompinit
bashcompinit
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete dar-backup)"
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete cleanup)"
eval "$(register-python-argcomplete manager)"
```

Then reload Zsh:

```zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Easy development setup

It is very easy to have your own development environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/per2jensen/dar-backup.git
cd dar-backup/v2
./build.py
```

This script:

- Creates a Python virtual environment called `venv`
- pip install `hatch`
- pip install the development environment as setup in pyproject.toml

  --
  
  ```text
  dev = [
  "pytest",
  "wheel>=0.45.1",
  "requests>=2.32.2",
  "coverage>=7.8.2",
  "pytest>=8.4.0",
  "pytest-cov>=6.1.1",
  "psutil>=7.0.0",
  "pytest-timeout>=2.4.0",
  "httpcore>=0.17.3",
  "h11>=0.16.0",
  "zipp>=3.19.1",
  "anyio>=4.4.0",
  "black>=25.1.0"]
  ```

✅ Your environment is now ready to activate and test!

Activate and run the test suite:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate # activate the virtual env
pytest                   # run the test suite
```

## Todo

- Perhaps look into pre-processing backup definitions. As `dar` does not expand env vars
  `dar-backup` could do so and feed the result to `dar`.
- Look into a way to move the .par2 files away from the `dar` slices, to maximize chance of good redundancy.
- Add option to dar-backup to use the `dar` option `--fsa-scope none`

## Known Limitations / Edge Cases

Does not currently encrypt data (by design — relies on encrypted storage)

One backup definition per file

.par2 files created for each slice (may be moved in future)

#### Cleanup env vars

| Env var | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DAR_BACKUP_CONFIG_FILE | path to the config file | Default is $HOME/.config/dar-backup/dar-backup.conf |

### Clean-log options

This script removes excessive logging output from `dar` logs, improving readability and efficiency. Available options:

```bash
-f, --file <path>          Specify the log file(s) to be cleaned.
-c, --config-file <path>   Path to dar-backup.conf.
--dry-run                  Show which lines would be removed without modifying the file.
-v, --version              Display version and licensing information.
-h, --help                 Displays usage info
```

### Dar-backup-systemd options

Generates and optionally install systemd user service units and timers.

```bash
-h, --help           Show this help message and exit
--venv VENV          Path to the Python venv with dar-backup
--dar-path DAR_PATH  Optional path to dar binary's directory
--install            Install the units to ~/.config/systemd/user
```

### Installer options

Sets up `dar-backup` according to provided config file.

The installer creates the necessary backup catalog databases if `--create-db` is given.

```bash
--config                 Path to a config file. The configured directories will be created.
--create-db              Create backup catalog databases. Use this option with `--config`.
--install-autocompletion Add bash or zsh auto completion - idempotent.
--remove-autocompletion  Remove the auto completion from bash or zsh.
-v, --version            Display version and licensing information.
-h, --help               Displays usage info.
```

### Demo options

Sets up `dar-backup` in a demo configuration.

It is non-destructive and stops if directories are already in place.

Create directories:

- ~/.config/dar-backup/
  - ~/.config/dar-backup/backup.d/
- ~/dar-backup/
  - ~/dar-backup/backups/
  - ~/dar-backup/restore/

Sets up demo config files:

- ~/.config/dar-backup/dar-backup.conf
- ~/.config/dar-backup/backup.d/demo

```bash
-i, --install       Sets up `dar-backup`.
--root-dir          Specify the root directory for the backup.
--dir-to-backup     Directory to backup, relative to the root directory.
--backup-dir        Directory where backups and redundancy files are put.
--override          By default, the script will not overwrite existing files or directories.
                    Use this option to override this behavior.
--generate          Generate config files and put them in /tmp/ for inspection
                    without writing to $HOME.
-v, --version       Display version and licensing information.
-h, --help          Displays usage info
```

### Config changes

#### 1.0.1

##### DISCORD WEBHOOK

For Discord notifications use the `DAR_BACKUP_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` environment variable. It should not be placed in the config file.

DAR_BACKUP_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL is the entire endpoint like this:

```bash
export DAR_BACKUP_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/\<userId\>/\<uuid\>
```

##### Restore test config

Restore tests choose random files from the archive and compare them with the live filesystem.
To avoid noisy paths (caches, temp files, logs), you can exclude candidates before the random
selection happens. All matching is case-insensitive.

Config keys (in [MISC]):

- RESTORETEST_EXCLUDE_PREFIXES: comma-separated path prefixes to skip. Matches from the start of
  the path (after trimming a leading "/"). Use trailing "/" for directories.
- RESTORETEST_EXCLUDE_SUFFIXES: comma-separated filename suffixes to skip.
- RESTORETEST_EXCLUDE_REGEX: optional regex to skip anything matching the path.

Example:

```ini
[MISC]
RESTORETEST_EXCLUDE_PREFIXES = .cache/, .local/share/Trash/, .mozilla/, snap/firefox/common/.mozilla/
RESTORETEST_EXCLUDE_SUFFIXES = .sqlite-wal, .sqlite-shm, .log, .tmp, .lock, .journal
RESTORETEST_EXCLUDE_REGEX = (^|/)(Cache|cache|Logs|log)/
```

Regex tips (case-insensitive):

- Match common cache/log directories anywhere:
  `(^|/)(cache|logs)/`
- Skip thumbnails and temp dirs:
  `(^|/)(thumbnails|tmp|temp)/`
- Exclude browser profile noise while keeping other files:
  `(^|/)\.mozilla/|/snap/firefox/common/\.mozilla/`

##### Par2

New optional PAR2 settings were added to the config file. If none of these keys are added, dar-backup behaves exactly as before (PAR2 files next to archives, per-slice parity).

| Name | Description | When it is in effect | Suggested value |
|------|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| PAR2_DIR | Directory to store .par2 and .vol*.par2 files | When set | A different device or mount from BACKUP_DIR |
| PAR2_RATIO_FULL | Redundancy percent for FULL | When set | 10 (%) |
| PAR2_RATIO_DIFF | Redundancy percent for DIFF | When set | 5  (%)|
| PAR2_RATIO_INCR | Redundancy percent for INCR | When set | 5  (%)|
| PAR2_RUN_VERIFY | Verify after create | When set | false |

Notes:

- PAR2_RATIO_*, and PAR2_RUN_VERIFY apply even if PAR2_DIR is not set (i.e. par2 output stays next to the archives).

Per-backup overrides use a section named after the backup definition with the same PAR2_* keys:

```text

######################################################################
# Per-backup configuration example overrides
######################################################################

# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Per-backup overrides (section name must match backup.d filename stem)
# Example: backup.d/home.conf  ->  [home]
# --------------------------------------------------------------------

#[home]
# Disable PAR2 entirely for this backup definition
PAR2_ENABLED = false
#
#[media]
# Store PAR2 files in a separate location for this backup definition
#PAR2_DIR = /samba/par2/media
# Raise redundancy only for FULL
#
[documents]
# Run verify par2 sets after creation
PAR2_RUN_VERIFY = true
#
#[etc]
# Keep global PAR2 settings but tweak ratios for this backup definition
# RATIO is given in percent (%)
#PAR2_RATIO_FULL = 15  
#PAR2_RATIO_DIFF = 8
#PAR2_RATIO_INCR = 8
```

#### 1.0.2

##### Trace Logging

To support debugging without cluttering the main log file, a secondary trace log is now created (e.g., `dar-backup.trace.log`).
This file captures all `DEBUG` level messages and full exception stack traces.

You can configure its rotation in the `[MISC]` section:

- `TRACE_LOG_MAX_BYTES`: Max size of the trace log file in bytes. Default is `10485760` (10 MB).
- `TRACE_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT`: Number of rotated trace log files to keep. Default is `1`.

Example:

```ini
[MISC]
TRACE_LOG_MAX_BYTES = 10485760
TRACE_LOG_BACKUP_COUNT = 1
```

##### Command output Capture

- New optional `[MISC]` setting: `COMMAND_CAPTURE_MAX_BYTES` (default 102400).
  - Limits how much stdout/stderr is kept in memory per command while still logging full output.
  - Set to `0` to disable buffering entirely. Command output is still streamed to dar-backup-commands.log
  - If set to `0`, the calling function cannot rely on output from the executed command. The exit value is the only result provided.

Example:

```ini
[MISC]
COMMAND_CAPTURE_MAX_BYTES = 102400
```
