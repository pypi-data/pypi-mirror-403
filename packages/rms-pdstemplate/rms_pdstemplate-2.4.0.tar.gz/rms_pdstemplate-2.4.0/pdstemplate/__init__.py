"""PDS Ring-Moon Systems Node, SETI Institute

``pdstemplate`` is a Python module that defines the :class:`PdsTemplate` class, which is
used to generate PDS labels based on template files. Both PDS3 and PDS4 (xml) labels are
supported. Although specifically designed to facilitate data deliveries by PDS data
providers, the template system is generic and can be used to generate files from templates
for other purposes.

###############
Getting Started
###############

The general procedure is as follows:

1. Create a template object by calling the :meth:`PdsTemplate` constructor to read a
template file::

    from pdstemplate import PdsTemplate
    template = PdsTemplate(template_file_path)

2. Create a dictionary that contains the parameter values to use inside the label.

3. Construct the label using method :meth:`~PdsTemplate.write` as follows::

    template.write(dictionary, label_file)

This will create a new label of the given name, using the values in the given dictionary.
Once the template has been constructed, steps 2 and 3 can be repeated any number of times.

Alternatively, you can obtain the content of a label without writing it to a file using
method :meth:`~PdsTemplate.generate`.

``pdstemplate`` employs the RMS Node's `rms-filecache
<https://pypi.org/project/rms-filecache>`_ module and its `FCPath
<https://rms-filecache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#filecache.file_cache_path.FCPath>`_
class to support the handling of files at a website or in the cloud. You can refer to a
remote file by URL and the :class:`PdsTemplate` will treat it as if it were a local file.
See `filecache's documentation
<https://rms-filecache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ for further details.

###############
Template Syntax
###############

A template file will look generally like a label file, except for certain embedded
expressions that will be replaced when the template's :meth:`~PdsTemplate.write` or
:meth:`~PdsTemplate.generate` method is called.

*************
Substitutions
*************

In general, everything between dollar signs "$" in the template is interpreted as a
Python expression to be evaluated. The result of this expression then replaces it
inside the label. For example, if ``dictionary['INSTRUMENT_ID'] == 'ISSWA'``, then::

    <instrument_id>$INSTRUMENT_ID$</instrument_id>

in the template will become::

    <instrument_id>ISSWA</instrument_id>

in the label. The expression between "$" in the template can include indexes, function
calls, or just about any other Python expression. As another example, using the same
dictionary above::

    <camera_fov>$"Narrow" if INSTRUMENT_ID == "ISSNA" else "Wide"$</camera_fov>

in the template will become this in the label::

    <camera_fov>Wide</camera_fov>

An expression in the template of the form ``$name=expression$``, where the `name` is a
valid Python variable name, will also also have the side-effect of defining this
variable so that it can be re-used later in the template. For example, if this appears
as an expression::

    $cruise_or_saturn=('cruise' if START_TIME < 2004 else 'saturn')$

then later in the template, one can write::

    <lid_reference>
    urn:nasa:pds:cassini_iss_$cruise_or_saturn$:data_raw:cum-index
    </lid_reference>

To embed a literal "$" inside a label, enter "$$" into the template.

*******
Headers
*******

Headers provide even more sophisticaed control over the content of a label. A header
appears alone on a line of the template and begins with "$" as the first non-blank
character. It determines whether or how subsequent text of the template will appear in the
file, from here up to the next header line.

===============
FOR and END_FOR
===============

You can include one or more repetitions of the same text using ``FOR`` and ``END_FOR``.
The format is::

    $FOR(expression)
        <template text>
    $END_FOR

where `expression` evaluates to a Python iterable. Within the `template text`, these new
variable names are assigned:

- `VALUE` = the current value of the iterator;
- `INDEX` = the index of this iteration, starting from zero;
- `LENGTH` = the total number of iterations.

For example, if::

    dictionary["targets"] = ["Jupiter", "Io", "Europa"]
    dictionary["naif_ids"] = [599, 501, 502]

then::

    $FOR(targets)
        <target_name>$VALUE (naif_ids[INDEX])$</target_name>
    $END_FOR

in the template will become this in the label::

    <target_name>Jupiter (599)</target_name>
    <target_name>Io (501)</target_name>
    <target_name>Europa (502)</target_name>

Instead of using the names `VALUE`, `INDEX`, and `LENGTH`, you can customize the variable
names by listing up to three comma-separated names and an equal sign "=" before the
iterable expression. For example, this will produce the same results as the example
above::

    $FOR(name, k=targets)
        <target_name>$name (naif_ids[k])$</target_name>
    $END_FOR

=============================
IF, ELSE_IF, ELSE, and END_IF
=============================

You can use ``IF``, ``ELSE_IF``, ``ELSE``, and ``END_IF`` to select among alternative
blocks of text in the template:

- ``IF(expression)``: Evaluate `expression` and include the next lines of the template if
  it is logically True (e.g., boolean True, a nonzero number, a non-empty list or string,
  etc.).

- ``ELSE_IF(expression)``: Include the next lines of the template if `expression` is
  logically True and every previous expression was logically false.

- ``ELSE``: Include the next lines of the template only if all prior expressions were
  logically False.

- ``END_IF``:  This marks the end of the set of if/else alternatives.

As with other substitutions, you can define a new variable of a specified name by using
`name=expression` inside the parentheses of ``IF()`` and ``ELSE_IF()``.

Note that headers can be nested arbitrarily inside the template.

.. _ONCE:

====
ONCE
====

``ONCE`` is a header that simply includes the content that follows it one time. However,
it is useful for its side-effect, which is that ``ONCE(expression)`` allows the embedded
`expression` to be evaluated without writing new text into the label. You can use this
capability to define variables internally without affecting the content of the label
produced. For example::

    $ONCE(date = big_dictionary["key"]["date"])

will assign the value of the variable named `date` for subsequent use within the template.

=======
INCLUDE
=======

This header will read the content of another file and insert its content into the template
here::

    $INCLUDE(filename)

Using the environment variable ``PDSTEMPLATE_INCLUDES``, you can define one or more
directories that will be searched for a file to be included. If multiple directories are
to be searched, they should be separated by colons. You can also specify one or more
directories to search in the :meth:`PdsTemplate` constructor using the `includes` input
parameter.

Include files are handled somewhat differently from other headers. When ``INCLUDE``
references a file as a literal string rather than as an expression to evaluate, it is
processed at the time that the :class:`PdsTemplate` is constructed. However, if the
filename is given as an expression, it is not evaluated until :meth:`~PdsTemplate.write``
or :meth:`~PdsTemplate.generate`` is called for each label.

=================
NOTE and END_NOTE
=================

You can use ``NOTE`` and ``END_NOTE`` to embed any arbitrary comment block into the
template. Any text between these headers does not appear in the label::

    $NOTE
    Here is an extended comment about the templae
    $END_NOTE

You can also use ``$NOTE:`` for an in-line comment. This text, and any blanks before it,
are not included in the label::

    <filter>$FILTER$</filter>   $NOTE: This is where we identify the filter

*********************
Pre-defined Functions
*********************

The following pre-defined functions can be used inside any expression in the template.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.BASENAME`:
  The basename of a filepath, with leading directory path removed.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.BOOL`
  Return one of two strings based on a boolean input.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.COUNTER`
  The current value of a counter.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.CURRENT_TIME`
  The current date or time in the local time zone as a string of the form "yyyy-mm-dd" or
  "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:sss".

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.CURRENT_ZULU`
  The current UTC date or time as a string of the form "yyyy-mm-dd" or
  "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:sssZ".

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.DATETIME`
  Convert a time to an ISO time string with the date expressed as "yyyy-mm-dd".

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.DATETIME_DOY`
  Convert a time to an ISO time string with the date expressed as "yyyy-ddd".

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.DAYSECS`
  Convert a time to the number of elapsed seconds since the most recent midnight.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.FILE_BYTES`
  The size in bytes of a specified file.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.FILE_MD5`
  The MD5 checksum of a specified file.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.FILE_RECORDS`
  The number of records in a specified file.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.FILE_TIME`
  The modification time in the local time zone of the specified file.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.FILE_ZULU`
  The UTC modification time of a specified by file.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.GETENV`
  The value of any environment variable.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.LABEL_PATH`
  The file path of the label being written.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.LOG`
  Write a message to the current log.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.NOESCAPE`
  If the template is XML, evaluated expressions are "escaped" to ensure that they are
  suitable for embedding in a PDS4 label. For example, ">" inside a string will be
  replaced by "&gt;". This function prevents text from being escaped in the label,
  allowing it to contain literal XML.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.QUOTE_IF`
  Quote the given text if it requires quotes within a PDS3 label.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.RAISE`
  Raise an exception with a given class and text message.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.RECORD_BYTES`
  The maximum number of bytes in any record of a specified file, including line
  terminators.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.REPLACE_NA`
  Return either a given string or an indication that it is "not applicable".

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.REPLACE_UNK`
  Return either a given string or an indication that it is "unknown".

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.TEMPLATE_PATH`
  The directory path to the template file.

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.VERSION_ID`
  Version ID of this module using two digits, e.g., "v1.0".

- :meth:`~.PdsTemplate.WRAP`
  Wrap the given text to a specified indentation and width.

These functions can also be used directly by the programmer within a template; they are
static functions of class :class:`PdsTemplate`.

##############################
Logging and Exception Handling
##############################

``pdstemplate`` employs the RMS Node's `rms-pdslogger
<https://pypi.org/project/rms-pdslogger>`_ module to handle logging. By default, the
logger is a `PdsLogger
<https://rms-pdslogger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module.html#pdslogger.PdsLogger>`_ object,
although any ``logging.Logger`` object will work. See `pdslogger's documentation
<https://rms-pdslogger.readthedocs.io>`_ for further details.

You can override the default Logger using static method :meth:`~utils.set_logger`. You can
also set the logging level ("info", "warning", "error", etc.) using
:meth:`~utils.set_log_level` and can select among many log formatting options using
:meth:`~set_log_format`. Use :meth:`~utils.get_logger` to obtain the current Logger.

By default, exceptions during a call to :meth:`~PdsTemplate.write` or
:meth:`~PdsTemplate.generate` are handled as follows:

1. They are written to the log.
2. The expression that triggered the exception is replaced by the error text in the label,
   surrounded by "[[[" and "]]]" to make it easier to find.
3. The attributes ``fatal_count``, ``error_count``, and ``warning_count`` of the
   :class:`PdsTemplate` contain the number of messages logged by each category.
4. The exception is otherwise suppressed.

This behavior can be modified using ``raise_exceptions=True`` in the call to
:meth:`~PdsTemplate.write` or :meth:`~PdsTemplate.generate`; in this case, the exception
will be raised, label generation will stop, and the label will not be written.

##############
Pre-processors
##############

A pre-processor is a function that takes the text of a template file as input and returns
a new template as output. As described above, ``INCLUDE`` headers that contain an explicit
file name (rather than an expression to be evaluated) are handled by a pre-processor.

You may define your own functions to pre-process the content of a template. They must have
this call signature::

    func(path: str | Path | FCPath, content: str, *args, **kwargs) -> str

where

* `path` is the path to the template file (used here just for error logging).
* `content` is the content of a template represented by a single string with <LF> line
  terminators.
* `*args` is for any additional positional arguments to `func`.
* `**kwargs` is for any additional keyword arguments to `func`.

When you invoke the :meth:`PdsTemplate` constructor, one of the optional inputs is
`preprocess`, which takes either a single function or a list of functions to apply after
the INCLUDE pre-processor. For the first of these, the `args` and `kwargs` inputs can be
provided as additional inputs to the constructor. Subsequent pre-processors cannot take
additional arguments; define them using lambda notation instead.

Note that a :class:`PdsTemplate` object has an attribute `content`, which contains the
full content of the template after all pre-processing has been performed. You can examine
this attribute to see the final result of all processing. Note also that when line numbers
appear in an error message, they refer to the line number of the template after
pre-processing, not before.
