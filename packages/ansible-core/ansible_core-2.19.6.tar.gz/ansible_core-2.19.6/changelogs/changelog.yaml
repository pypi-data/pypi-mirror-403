  2.19.0b1:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - Support for the ``toml`` library has been removed from TOML inventory parsing
        and dumping. Use ``tomli`` for parsing on Python 3.10. Python 3.11 and later
        have built-in support for parsing. Use ``tomli-w`` to support outputting inventory
        in TOML format.
      - assert - The ``quiet`` argument must be a commonly-accepted boolean value.
        Previously, unrecognized values were silently treated as False.
      - conditionals - Conditional expressions that result in non-boolean values are
        now an error by default. Such results often indicate unintentional use of
        templates where they are not supported, resulting in a conditional that is
        always true. When this option is enabled, conditional expressions which are
        a literal ``None`` or empty string will evaluate as true, for backwards compatibility.
        The error can be temporarily changed to a deprecation warning by enabling
        the ``ALLOW_BROKEN_CONDITIONALS`` config option.
      - first_found lookup - When specifying ``files`` or ``paths`` as a templated
        list containing undefined values, the undefined list elements will be discarded
        with a warning. Previously, the entire list would be discarded without any
        warning.
      - internals - The ``AnsibleLoader`` and ``AnsibleDumper`` classes for working
        with YAML are now factory functions and cannot be extended.
      - internals - The ``ansible.utils.native_jinja`` Python module has been removed.
      - lookup plugins - Lookup plugins called as `with_(lookup)` will no longer have
        the `_subdir` attribute set.
      - lookup plugins - ``terms`` will always be passed to ``run`` as the first positional
        arg, where previously it was sometimes passed as a keyword arg when using
        ``with_`` syntax.
      - loops - Omit placeholders no longer leak between loop item templating and
        task templating. Previously, ``omit`` placeholders could remain embedded in
        loop items after templating and be used as an ``omit`` for task templating.
        Now, values resolving to ``omit`` are dropped immediately when loop items
        are templated. To turn missing values into an ``omit`` for task templating,
        use ``| default(omit)``. This solution is backward-compatible with previous
        versions of ansible-core.
      - modules - Ansible modules using ``sys.excepthook`` must use a standard ``try/except``
        instead.
      - plugins - Any plugin that sources or creates templates must properly tag them
        as trusted.
      - plugins - Custom Jinja plugins that accept undefined top-level arguments must
        opt in to receiving them.
      - plugins - Custom Jinja plugins that use ``environment.getitem`` to retrieve
        undefined values will now trigger a ``MarkerError`` exception. This exception
        must be handled to allow the plugin to return a ``Marker``, or the plugin
        must opt-in to accepting ``Marker`` values.
      - public API - The ``ansible.vars.fact_cache.FactCache`` wrapper has been removed.
      - serialization of ``omit`` sentinel - Serialization of variables containing
        ``omit`` sentinels (e.g., by the ``to_json`` and ``to_yaml`` filters or ``ansible-inventory``)
        will fail if the variable has not completed templating. Previously, serialization
        succeeded with placeholder strings emitted in the serialized output.
      - set_fact - The string values "yes", "no", "true" and "false" were previously
        converted (ignoring case) to boolean values when not using Jinja2 native mode.
        Since Jinja2 native mode is always used, this conversion no longer occurs.
        When boolean values are required, native boolean syntax should be used where
        variables are defined, such as in YAML. When native boolean syntax is not
        an option, the ``bool`` filter can be used to parse string values into booleans.
      - template lookup - The ``convert_data`` option is deprecated and no longer
        has any effect. Use the ``from_json`` filter on the lookup result instead.
      - templating - Access to ``_`` prefixed attributes and methods, and methods
        with known side effects, is no longer permitted. In cases where a matching
        mapping key is present, the associated value will be returned instead of an
        error. This increases template environment isolation and ensures more consistent
        behavior between the ``.`` and ``[]`` operators.
      - templating - Conditionals and lookups which use embedded inline templates
        in Jinja string constants now display a warning. These templates should be
        converted to their expression equivalent.
      - templating - Many Jinja plugins (filters, lookups, tests) and methods previously
        silently ignored undefined inputs, which often masked subtle errors. Passing
        an undefined argument to a Jinja plugin or method that does not declare undefined
        support now results in an undefined value.
      - templating - Templates are always rendered in Jinja2 native mode. As a result,
        non-string values are no longer automatically converted to strings.
      - templating - Templates resulting in ``None`` are no longer automatically converted
        to an empty string.
      - templating - Templates with embedded inline templates that were not contained
        within a Jinja string constant now result in an error, as support for multi-pass
        templating was removed for security reasons. In most cases, such templates
        can be easily rewritten to avoid the use of embedded inline templates.
      - templating - The ``allow_unsafe_lookups`` option no longer has any effect.
        Lookup plugins are responsible for tagging strings containing templates to
        allow evaluation as a template.
      - templating - The result of the ``range()`` global function cannot be returned
        from a template- it should always be passed to a filter (e.g., ``random``).
        Previously, range objects returned from an intermediate template were always
        converted to a list, which is inconsistent with inline consumption of range
        objects.
      - templating - ``#jinja2:`` overrides in templates with invalid override names
        or types are now templating errors.
      bugfixes:
      - Ansible will now also warn when reserved keywords are set via a module (set_fact,
        include_vars, etc).
      - Ansible.Basic - Fix ``required_if`` check when the option value to check is
        unset or set to null.
      - Correctly return ``False`` when using the ``filter`` and ``test`` Jinja tests
        on plugin names which are not filters or tests, respectively. (resolves issue
        https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82084)
      - Do not run implicit ``flush_handlers`` meta tasks when the whole play is excluded
        from the run due to tags specified.
      - Errors now preserve stacked error messages even when YAML is involved.
      - Fix a display.debug statement with the wrong param in _get_diff_data() method
      - Fix disabling SSL verification when installing collections and roles from
        git repositories. If ``--ignore-certs`` isn't provided, the value for the
        ``GALAXY_IGNORE_CERTS`` configuration option will be used (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83326).
      - Fix ipv6 pattern bug in lib/ansible/parsing/utils/addresses.py (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84237)
      - Fix returning 'unreachable' for the overall task result. This prevents false
        positives when a looped task has unignored unreachable items (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84019).
      - 'Implicit ``meta: flush_handlers`` tasks now have a parent block to prevent
        potential tracebacks when calling methods like ``get_play()`` on them internally.'
      - Improve performance on large inventories by reducing the number of implicit
        meta tasks.
      - Jinja plugins - Errors raised will always be derived from ``AnsibleTemplatePluginError``.
      - Optimize the way tasks from within ``include_tasks``/``include_role`` are
        inserted into the play.
      - Time out waiting on become is an unreachable error (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84468)
      - Use consistent multiprocessing context for action write locks
      - Use the requested error message in the ansible.module_utils.facts.timeout
        timeout function instead of hardcoding one.
      - Windows - add support for running on system where WDAC is in audit mode with
        ``Dynamic Code Security`` enabled.
      - YAML parsing - The `!unsafe` tag no longer coerces non-string scalars to strings.
      - "``ansible-galaxy`` \u2014 the collection dependency resolver now treats version
        specifiers starting with ``!=`` as unpinned."
      - '``package``/``dnf`` action plugins - provide the reason behind the failure
        to gather the ``ansible_pkg_mgr`` fact to identify the package backend'
      - action plugins - Action plugins that raise unhandled exceptions no longer
        terminate playbook loops. Previously, exceptions raised by an action plugin
        caused abnormal loop termination and loss of loop iteration results.
      - ansible-config - format galaxy server configs while dumping in JSON format
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84840).
      - ansible-doc - If none of the files in files exists, path will be undefined
        and a direct reference will throw an UnboundLocalError (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/84464).
      - ansible-galaxy - Small adjustments to URL building for ``download_url`` and
        relative redirects.
      - ansible-pull change detection will now work independently of callback or result
        format settings.
      - ansible-test - Enable the ``sys.unraisablehook`` work-around for the ``pylint``
        sanity test on Python 3.11. Previously the work-around was only enabled for
        Python 3.12 and later. However, the same issue has been discovered on Python
        3.11.
      - ansible-test - Ensure CA certificates are installed on managed FreeBSD instances.
      - ansible-test - Fix support for PowerShell module_util imports with the ``-Optional``
        flag.
      - ansible-test - Fix support for detecting PowerShell modules importing module
        utils with the newer ``#AnsibleRequires`` format.
      - ansible-test - Fix traceback that occurs after an interactive command fails.
      - ansible-test - Fix up coverage reporting to properly translate the temporary
        path of integration test modules to the expected static test module path.
      - ansible-test - Fixed traceback when handling certain YAML errors in the ``yamllint``
        sanity test.
      - ansible-test - Managed macOS instances now use the ``sudo_chdir`` option for
        the ``sudo`` become plugin to avoid permission errors when dropping privileges.
      - ansible-vault will now correctly handle `--prompt`, previously it would issue
        an error about stdin if no 2nd argument was passed
      - ansible_uptime_second - added ansible_uptime_seconds fact support for AIX
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/84321).
      - apt_key module - prevent tests from running when apt-key was removed
      - base.yml - deprecated libvirt_lxc_noseclabel config.
      - build - Pin ``wheel`` in ``pyproject.toml`` to ensure compatibility with supported
        ``setuptools`` versions.
      - config - various fixes to config lookup plugin (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/84398).
      - copy - refactor copy module for simplicity.
      - copy action now prevents user from setting internal options.
      - debconf - set empty password values (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83214).
      - debug - hide loop vars in debug var display (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65856).
      - default callback - Error context is now shown for failing tasks that use the
        ``debug`` action.
      - display - The ``Display.deprecated`` method once again properly handles the
        ``removed=True`` argument (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82358).
      - distro - add support for Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE) (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84934).
      - distro - detect Debian as os_family for LMDE 6 (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84934).
      - dnf5 - Handle forwarded exceptions from dnf5-5.2.13 where a generic ``RuntimeError``
        was previously raised
      - dnf5 - fix ``is_installed`` check for packages that are not installed but
        listed as provided by an installed package (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84578)
      - dnf5 - fix installing a package using ``state=latest`` when a binary of the
        same name as the package is already installed (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84259)
      - dnf5 - fix traceback when ``enable_plugins``/``disable_plugins`` is used on
        ``python3-libdnf5`` versions that do not support this functionality
      - dnf5 - libdnf5 - use ``conf.pkg_gpgcheck`` instead of deprecated ``conf.gpgcheck``
        which is used only as a fallback
      - dnf5 - matching on a binary can be achieved only by specifying a full path
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84334)
      - facts - gather pagesize and calculate respective values depending upon architecture
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84773).
      - facts - skip if distribution file path is directory, instead of raising error
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84006).
      - find - skip ENOENT error code while recursively enumerating files. find module
        will now be tolerant to race conditions that remove files or directories from
        the target it is currently inspecting. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84873).
      - first_found lookup - Corrected return value documentation to reflect None
        (not empty string) for no files found.
      - gather_facts action now defaults to `ansible.legacy.setup` if `smart` was
        set, no network OS was found and no other alias for `setup` was present.
      - gather_facts action will now issues errors and warnings as appropriate if
        a network OS is detected but no facts modules are defined for it.
      - gather_facts action, will now add setup when 'smart' appears with other modules
        in the FACTS_MODULES setting (#84750).
      - get_url - add support for BSD-style checksum digest file (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84476).
      - get_url - fix honoring ``filename`` from the ``content-disposition`` header
        even when the type is ``inline`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83690)
      - host_group_vars - fixed defining the 'key' variable if the get_vars method
        is called with cache=False (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84384)
      - include_vars - fix including previously undefined hash variables with hash_behaviour
        merge (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84295).
      - iptables - Allows the wait parameter to be used with iptables chain creation
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84490)
      - linear strategy - fix executing ``end_role`` meta tasks for each host, instead
        of handling these as implicit run_once tasks (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84660).
      - local connection plugin - Become timeout errors now include all received data.
        Previously, the most recently-received data was discarded.
      - local connection plugin - Ensure ``become`` success validation always occurs,
        even when an active plugin does not set ``prompt``.
      - local connection plugin - Fixed cases where the internal ``BECOME-SUCCESS``
        message appeared in task output.
      - local connection plugin - Fixed hang or spurious failure when data arrived
        concurrently on stdout and stderr during a successful ``become`` operation
        validation.
      - local connection plugin - Fixed hang when a become plugin expects a prompt
        but a password was not provided.
      - local connection plugin - Fixed hang when an active become plugin incorrectly
        signals lack of prompt.
      - local connection plugin - Fixed hang when an internal become read timeout
        expired before the password prompt was written.
      - local connection plugin - Fixed hang when only one of stdout or stderr was
        closed by the ``become_exe`` subprocess.
      - local connection plugin - Fixed long timeout/hang for ``become`` plugins that
        repeat their prompt on failure (e.g., ``sudo``, some ``su`` implementations).
      - local connection plugin - Fixed silent ignore of ``become`` failures and loss
        of task output when data arrived concurrently on stdout and stderr during
        ``become`` operation validation.
      - local connection plugin - Fixed task output header truncation when post-become
        data arrived before ``become`` operation validation had completed.
      - lookup plugins - The ``terms`` arg to the ``run`` method is now always a list.
        Previously, there were cases where a non-list could be received.
      - module arg templating - When using a templated raw task arg and a templated
        ``args`` keyword, args are now merged. Previously use of templated raw task
        args silently ignored all values from the templated ``args`` keyword.
      - module defaults - Module defaults are no longer templated unless they are
        used by a task that does not override them. Previously, all module defaults
        for all modules were templated for every task.
      - module respawn - limit to supported Python versions
      - package_facts module when using 'auto' will return the first package manager
        found that provides an output, instead of just the first one, as this can
        be foreign and not have any packages.
      - psrp - Improve stderr parsing when running raw commands that emit error records
        or stderr lines.
      - regex_search filter - Corrected return value documentation to reflect None
        (not empty string) for no match.
      - respawn - use copy of env variables to update existing PYTHONPATH value (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84954).
      - runas become - Fix up become logic to still get the SYSTEM token with the
        most privileges when running as SYSTEM.
      - sequence lookup - sequence query/lookups without positional arguments now
        return a valid list if their kwargs comprise a valid sequence expression (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82921).
      - service_facts - skip lines which does not contain service names in openrc
        output (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84512).
      - ssh - Improve the logic for parsing CLIXML data in stderr when working with
        Windows host. This fixes issues when the raw stderr contains invalid UTF-8
        byte sequences and improves embedded CLIXML sequences.
      - ssh - Raise exception when sshpass returns error code (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/58133).
      - ssh - connection options were incorrectly templated during ``reset_connection``
        tasks (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/84238).
      - stability - Fixed silent process failure on unhandled IOError/OSError under
        ``linear`` strategy.
      - su become plugin - Ensure generated regex from ``prompt_l10n`` config values
        is properly escaped.
      - su become plugin - Ensure that password prompts are correctly detected in
        the presence of leading output. Previously, this case resulted in a timeout
        or hang.
      - su become plugin - Ensure that trailing colon is expected on all ``prompt_l10n``
        config values.
      - sudo become plugin - The `sudo_chdir` config option allows the current directory
        to be set to the specified value before executing sudo to avoid permission
        errors when dropping privileges.
      - sunos - remove hard coding of virtinfo command in facts gathering code (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/84357).
      - to_yaml/to_nice_yaml filters - Eliminated possibility of keyword arg collisions
        with internally-set defaults.
      - unarchive - Clamp timestamps from beyond y2038 to representible values when
        unpacking zip files on platforms that use 32-bit time_t (e.g. Debian i386).
      - uri - Form location correctly when the server returns a relative redirect
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84540)
      - uri - Handle HTTP exceptions raised while reading the content (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83794).
      - uri - mark ``url`` as required (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/83642).
      - user - Create Buildroot subclass as alias to Busybox (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83665).
      - user - Set timeout for passphrase interaction.
      - user - Update prompt for SSH key passphrase (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84484).
      - user - Use higher precedence HOME_MODE as UMASK for path provided (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/84482).
      - user action will now require O(force) to overwrite the public part of an ssh
        key when generating ssh keys, as was already the case for the private part.
      - user module now avoids changing ownership of files symlinked in provided home
        dir skeleton
      - vars lookup - The ``default`` substitution only applies when trying to look
        up a variable which is not defined. If the variable is defined, but templates
        to an undefined value, the ``default`` substitution will not apply. Use the
        ``default`` filter to coerce those values instead.
      - wait_for_connection - a warning was displayed if any hosts used a local connection
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84419)
      deprecated_features:
      - CLI - The ``--inventory-file`` option alias is deprecated. Use the ``-i``
        or ``--inventory`` option instead.
      - Strategy Plugins - Use of strategy plugins not provided in ``ansible.builtin``
        are deprecated and do not carry any backwards compatibility guarantees going
        forward. A future release will remove the ability to use external strategy
        plugins. No alternative for third party strategy plugins is currently planned.
      - '``ansible.module_utils.compat.datetime`` - The datetime compatibility shims
        are now deprecated. They are scheduled to be removed in ``ansible-core`` v2.21.
        This includes ``UTC``, ``utcfromtimestamp()`` and ``utcnow`` importable from
        said module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81874).'
      - bool filter - Support for coercing unrecognized input values (including None)
        has been deprecated. Consult the filter documentation for acceptable values,
        or consider use of the ``truthy`` and ``falsy`` tests.
      - cache plugins - The `ansible.plugins.cache.base` Python module is deprecated.
        Use `ansible.plugins.cache` instead.
      - callback plugins - The `v2_on_any` callback method is deprecated. Use specific
        callback methods instead.
      - callback plugins - The v1 callback API (callback methods not prefixed with
        `v2_`) is deprecated. Use `v2_` prefixed methods instead.
      - conditionals - Conditionals using Jinja templating delimiters (e.g., ``{{``,
        ``{%``) should be rewritten as expressions without delimiters, unless the
        entire conditional value is a single template that resolves to a trusted string
        expression. This is useful for dynamic indirection of conditional expressions,
        but is limited to trusted literal string expressions.
      - config - The ``ACTION_WARNINGS`` config has no effect. It previously disabled
        command warnings, which have since been removed.
      - config - The ``DEFAULT_JINJA2_NATIVE`` option has no effect. Jinja2 native
        mode is now the default and only option.
      - config - The ``DEFAULT_NULL_REPRESENTATION`` option has no effect. Null values
        are no longer automatically converted to another value during templating of
        single variable references.
      - display - The ``Display.get_deprecation_message`` method has been deprecated.
        Call ``Display.deprecated`` to display a deprecation message, or call it with
        ``removed=True`` to raise an ``AnsibleError``.
      - file loading - Loading text files with ``DataLoader`` containing data that
        cannot be decoded under the expected encoding is deprecated. In most cases
        the encoding must be UTF-8, although some plugins allow choosing a different
        encoding. Previously, invalid data was silently wrapped in Unicode surrogate
        escape sequences, often resulting in later errors or other data corruption.
      - first_found lookup - Splitting of file paths on ``,;:`` is deprecated. Pass
        a list of paths instead. The ``split`` method on strings can be used to split
        variables into a list as needed.
      - interpreter discovery - The ``auto_legacy`` and ``auto_legacy_silent`` options
        for ``INTERPRETER_PYTHON`` are deprecated. Use ``auto`` or ``auto_silent``
        options instead, as they have the same effect.
      - oneline callback - The ``oneline`` callback and its associated ad-hoc CLI
        args (``-o``, ``--one-line``) are deprecated.
      - paramiko - The paramiko connection plugin has been deprecated with planned
        removal in 2.21.
      - playbook variables - The ``play_hosts`` variable has been deprecated, use
        ``ansible_play_batch`` instead.
      - plugin error handling - The ``AnsibleError`` constructor arg ``suppress_extended_error``
        is deprecated. Using ``suppress_extended_error=True`` has the same effect
        as ``show_content=False``.
      - template lookup - The jinja2_native option is no longer used in the Ansible
        Core code base. Jinja2 native mode is now the default and only option.
      - templating - Support for enabling Jinja2 extensions (not plugins) has been
        deprecated.
      - templating - The ``disable_lookups`` option has no effect, since plugins must
        be updated to apply trust before any templating can be performed.
      - tree callback - The ``tree`` callback and its associated ad-hoc CLI args (``-t``,
        ``--tree``) are deprecated.
      major_changes:
      - Jinja plugins - Jinja builtin filter and test plugins are now accessible via
        their fully-qualified names ``ansible.builtin.{name}``.
      - Task Execution / Forks - Forks no longer inherit stdio from the parent ``ansible-playbook``
        process. ``stdout``, ``stderr``, and ``stdin`` within a worker are detached
        from the terminal, and non-functional. All needs to access stdio from a fork
        for controller side plugins requires use of ``Display``.
      - ansible-test - Packages beneath ``module_utils`` can now contain ``__init__.py``
        files.
      - variables - The type system underlying Ansible's variable storage has been
        significantly overhauled and formalized. Attempts to store unsupported Python
        object types in variables now more consistently yields early warnings or errors.
      - variables - To support new Ansible features, many variable objects are now
        represented by subclasses of their respective native Python types. In most
        cases, they behave indistinguishably from their original types, but some Python
        libraries do not handle builtin object subclasses properly. Custom plugins
        that interact with such libraries may require changes to convert and pass
        the native types.
      minor_changes:
      - Added a -vvvvv log message indicating when a host fails to produce output
        within the timeout period.
      - AnsibleModule.uri - Add option ``multipart_encoding`` for ``form-multipart``
        files in body to change default base64 encoding for files
      - INVENTORY_IGNORE_EXTS config, removed ``ini`` from the default list, inventory
        scripts using a corresponding .ini configuration are rare now and inventory.ini
        files are more common. Those that need to ignore the ini files for inventory
        scripts can still add it to configuration.
      - Jinja plugins - Plugins can declare support for undefined values.
      - Jinja2 version 3.1.0 or later is now required on the controller.
      - Move ``follow_redirects`` parameter to module_utils so external modules can
        reuse it.
      - PlayIterator - do not return tasks from already executed roles so specific
        strategy plugins do not have to do the filtering of such tasks themselves
      - SSH Escalation-related -vvv log messages now include the associated host information.
      - Windows - Add support for Windows Server 2025 to Ansible and as an ``ansible-test``
        remote target - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84229
      - Windows - refactor the async implementation to better handle errors during
        bootstrapping and avoid WMI when possible.
      - "``ansible-galaxy collection install`` \u2014 the collection dependency resolver
        now prints out conflicts it hits during dependency resolution when it's taking
        too long and it ends up backtracking a lot. It also displays suggestions on
        how to help it compute the result more quickly."
      - 'ansible, ansible-console, ansible-pull - add --flush-cache option (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83749).

        '
      - ansible-galaxy - Add support for Keycloak service accounts
      - ansible-galaxy - support ``resolvelib >= 0.5.3, < 2.0.0`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84217).

        results vary by Python version.
      - ansible-test - Disable the ``pep8`` sanity test rules ``E701`` and ``E704``
        to improve compatibility with ``black``.
      - ansible-test - Improve container runtime probe error handling. When unexpected
        probe output is encountered, an error with more useful debugging information
        is provided.
      - ansible-test - Replace container Alpine 3.20 with 3.21.
      - ansible-test - Replace container Fedora 40 with 41.
      - ansible-test - Replace remote Alpine 3.20 with 3.21.

      - ansible-test - Use Python's ``urllib`` instead of ``curl`` for HTTP requests.
      - ansible-test - When detection of the current container network fails, a warning
        is now issued and execution continues. This simplifies usage in cases where
        the current container cannot be inspected, such as when running in GitHub
        Codespaces.
      - ansible-test acme test container - bump `version to 2.3.0 <https://github.com/ansible/acme-test-container/releases/tag/2.3.0>`__
        to include newer versions of Pebble, dependencies, and runtimes. This adds
        support for ACME profiles, ``dns-account-01`` support, and some smaller improvements
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/84547).
      - apt_key module - add notes to docs and errors to point at the CLI tool deprecation
        by Debian and alternatives
      - apt_repository module - add notes to errors to point at the CLI tool deprecation
        by Debian and alternatives
      - become plugins get new property 'pipelining' to show support or lack there
        of for the feature.
      - callback plugins - add has_option() to CallbackBase to match other functions
        overloaded from AnsiblePlugin
      - callback plugins - fix get_options() for CallbackBase
      - copy - fix sanity test failures (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/83643).
      - copy - parameter ``local_follow`` was incorrectly documented as having default
        value ``True`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/83643).
      - cron - Provide additional error information while writing cron file (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83223).
      - csvfile - let the config system do the typecasting (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/82263).
      - display - Deduplication of warning and error messages considers the full content
        of the message (including source and traceback contexts, if enabled). This
        may result in fewer messages being omitted.
      - distribution - Added openSUSE MicroOS to Suse OS family (#84685).
      - dnf5, apt - add ``auto_install_module_deps`` option (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84206)
      - docs - add collection name in message from which the module is being deprecated
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84116).
      - env lookup - The error message generated for a missing environment variable
        when ``default`` is an undefined value (e.g. ``undef('something')``) will
        contain the hint from that undefined value, except when the undefined value
        is the default of ``undef()`` with no arguments. Previously, any existing
        undefined hint would be ignored.
      - file - enable file module to disable diff_mode (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/80817).
      - file - make code more readable and simple.
      - filter - add support for URL-safe encoding and decoding in b64encode and b64decode
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84147).
      - find - add a checksum_algorithm parameter to specify which type of checksum
        the module will return
      - from_json filter - The filter accepts a ``profile`` argument, which defaults
        to ``tagless``.
      - handlers - Templated handler names with syntax errors, or that resolve to
        ``omit`` are now skipped like handlers with undefined variables in their name.
      - improved error message for yaml parsing errors in plugin documentation
      - local connection plugin - A new ``become_strip_preamble`` config option (default
        True) was added; disable to preserve diagnostic ``become`` output in task
        results.
      - local connection plugin - A new ``become_success_timeout`` operation-wide
        timeout config (default 10s) was added for ``become``.
      - local connection plugin - When a ``become`` plugin's ``prompt`` value is a
        non-string after the ``check_password_prompt`` callback has completed, no
        prompt stripping will occur on stderr.
      - lookup_template - add an option to trim blocks while templating (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75962).
      - module - set ipv4 and ipv6 rules simultaneously in iptables module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84404).
      - module_utils - Add ``NoReturn`` type annotations to functions which never
        return.
      - modules - PowerShell modules can now receive ``datetime.date``, ``datetime.time``
        and ``datetime.datetime`` values as ISO 8601 strings.
      - modules - PowerShell modules can now receive strings sourced from inline vault-encrypted
        strings.
      - modules - Unhandled exceptions during Python module execution are now returned
        as structured data from the target. This allows the new traceback handling
        to be applied to exceptions raised on targets.
      - pipelining logic has mostly moved to connection plugins so they can decide/override
        settings.
      - plugin error handling - When raising exceptions in an exception handler, be
        sure to use ``raise ... from`` as appropriate. This supersedes the use of
        the ``AnsibleError`` arg ``orig_exc`` to represent the cause. Specifying ``orig_exc``
        as the cause is still permitted. Failure to use ``raise ... from`` when ``orig_exc``
        is set will result in a warning. Additionally, if the two cause exceptions
        do not match, a warning will be issued.
      - removed hardcoding of su plugin as it now works with pipelining.
      - runtime-metadata sanity test - improve validation of ``action_groups`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/83965).
      - service_facts module got freebsd support added.
      - ssh connection plugin - Support ``SSH_ASKPASS`` mechanism to provide passwords,
        making it the default, but still offering an explicit choice to use ``sshpass``
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/83936)
      - ssh connection plugin now overrides pipelining when a tty is requested.
      - ssh-agent - ``ansible``, ``ansible-playbook`` and ``ansible-console`` are
        capable of spawning or reusing an ssh-agent, allowing plugins to interact
        with the ssh-agent. Additionally a pure python ssh-agent client has been added,
        enabling easy interaction with the agent. The ssh connection plugin contains
        new functionality via ``ansible_ssh_private_key`` and ``ansible_ssh_private_key_passphrase``,
        for loading an SSH private key into the agent from a variable.
      - templating - Access to an undefined variable from inside a lookup, filter,
        or test (which raises MarkerError) no longer ends processing of the current
        template. The triggering undefined value is returned as the result of the
        offending plugin invocation, and the template continues to execute.
      - templating - Embedding ``range()`` values in containers such as lists will
        result in an error on use. Previously the value would be converted to a string
        representing the range parameters, such as ``range(0, 3)``.
      - templating - Handling of omitted values is now a first-class feature of the
        template engine, and is usable in all Ansible Jinja template contexts. Any
        template that resolves to ``omit`` is automatically removed from its parent
        container during templating.
      - templating - Template evaluation is lazier than in previous versions. Template
        expressions which resolve only portions of a data structure no longer result
        in the entire structure being templated.
      - templating - Templating errors now provide more information about both the
        location and context of the error, especially for deeply-nested and/or indirected
        templating scenarios.
      - templating - Unified ``omit`` behavior now requires that plugins calling ``Templar.template()``
        handle cases where the entire template result is omitted, by catching the
        ``AnsibleValueOmittedError`` that is raised. Previously, this condition caused
        a randomly-generated string marker to appear in the template result.
      - templating - Variables of type ``set`` and ``tuple`` are now converted to
        ``list`` when exiting the final pass of templating.
      - to_json / to_nice_json filters - The filters accept a ``profile`` argument,
        which defaults to ``tagless``.
      - troubleshooting - Tracebacks can be collected and displayed for most errors,
        warnings, and deprecation warnings (including those generated by modules).
        Tracebacks are no longer enabled with ``-vvv``; the behavior is directly configurable
        via the ``DISPLAY_TRACEBACK`` config option. Module tracebacks passed to ``fail_json``
        via the ``exception`` kwarg will not be included in the task result unless
        error tracebacks are configured.
      - undef jinja function - The ``undef`` jinja function now raises an error if
        a non-string hint is given. Attempting to use an undefined hint also results
        in an error, ensuring incorrect use of the function can be distinguished from
        the function's normal behavior.
      - validate-modules sanity test - make sure that ``module`` and ``plugin`` ``seealso``
        entries use FQCNs (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/84325).
      - vault - improved vault filter documentation by adding missing example content
        for dump_template_data.j2, refining examples for clarity, and ensuring variable
        consistency (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/83583).
      - warnings - All warnings (including deprecation warnings) issued during a task's
        execution are now accessible via the ``warnings`` and ``deprecations`` keys
        on the task result.
      - when the ``dict`` lookup is given a non-dict argument, show the value of the
        argument and its type in the error message.
      - windows - add hard minimum limit for PowerShell to 5.1. Ansible dropped support
        for older versions of PowerShell in the 2.16 release but this requirement
        is now enforced at runtime.
      - windows - refactor windows exec runner to improve efficiency and add better
        error reporting on failures.
      - winrm - Remove need for pexpect on macOS hosts when using ``kinit`` to retrieve
        the Kerberos TGT. By default the code will now only use the builtin ``subprocess``
        library which should handle issues with select and a high fd count and also
        simplify the code.

        '
      removed_features:
      - Remove deprecated plural form of collection path (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/84156).
      - Removed deprecated STRING_CONVERSION_ACTION (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84220).
      - encrypt - passing unsupported passlib hashtype now raises AnsibleFilterError.
      - manager - remove deprecated include_delegate_to parameter from get_vars API.
      - modules - Modules returning non-UTF8 strings now result in an error. The ``MODULE_STRICT_UTF8_RESPONSE``
        setting can be used to disable this check.
      - removed deprecated pycompat24 and compat.importlib.
      - selector - remove deprecated compat.selector related files (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/84155).
      - windows - removed common module functions ``ConvertFrom-AnsibleJson``, ``Format-AnsibleException``
        from Windows modules as they are not used and add unneeded complexity to the
        code.
      security_fixes:
      - include_vars action - Ensure that result masking is correctly requested when
        vault-encrypted files are read. (CVE-2024-8775)
      - task result processing - Ensure that action-sourced result masking (``_ansible_no_log=True``)
        is preserved. (CVE-2024-8775)
      - templating - Ansible's template engine no longer processes Jinja templates
        in strings unless they are marked as coming from a trusted source. Untrusted
        strings containing Jinja template markers are ignored with a warning. Examples
        of trusted sources include playbooks, vars files, and many inventory sources.
        Examples of untrusted sources include module results and facts. Plugins which
        have not been updated to preserve trust while manipulating strings may inadvertently
        cause them to lose their trusted status.
      - templating - Changes to conditional expression handling removed numerous instances
        of insecure multi-pass templating (which could result in execution of untrusted
        template expressions).
      - user action won't allow ssh-keygen, chown and chmod to run on existing ssh
        public key file, avoiding traversal on existing symlinks (CVE-2024-9902).

  2.19.0b3:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Ansible will now ensure predictable permissions on remote artifacts, until
        now it only ensured executable and relied on system masks for the rest.
      - dnf5 - avoid generating excessive transaction entries in the dnf5 history
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85046)
      deprecated_features:
      - Passing a ``warnings` or ``deprecations`` key to ``exit_json`` or ``fail_json``
        is deprecated. Use ``AnsibleModule.warn`` or ``AnsibleModule.deprecate`` instead.
      - plugins - Accessing plugins with ``_``-prefixed filenames without the ``_``
        prefix is deprecated.
      minor_changes:
      - ansible-config will now show internal, but not test configuration entries.
        This allows for debugging but still denoting the configurations as internal
        use only (_ prefix).
      - ansible-test - Improved ``pylint`` checks for Ansible-specific deprecation
        functions.
      - ansible-test - Use the ``-t`` option to set the stop timeout when stopping
        a container. This avoids use of the ``--time`` option which was deprecated
        in Docker v28.0.
      - collection metadata - The collection loader now parses scalar values from
        ``meta/runtime.yml`` as strings. This avoids issues caused by unquoted values
        such as versions or dates being parsed as types other than strings.
      - deprecation warnings - Deprecation warning APIs automatically capture the
        identity of the deprecating plugin. The ``collection_name`` argument is only
        required to correctly attribute deprecations that occur in module_utils or
        other non-plugin code.
      - deprecation warnings - Improved deprecation messages to more clearly indicate
        the affected content, including plugin name when available.
      - deprecations - Collection name strings not of the form ``ns.coll`` passed
        to deprecation API functions will result in an error.
      - deprecations - Removed support for specifying deprecation dates as a ``datetime.date``,
        which was included in an earlier 2.19 pre-release.
      - deprecations - Some argument names to ``deprecate_value`` for consistency
        with existing APIs. An earlier 2.19 pre-release included a ``removal_`` prefix
        on the ``date`` and ``version`` arguments.
      - modules - The ``AnsibleModule.deprecate`` function no longer sends deprecation
        messages to the target host's logging system.

  2.19.0b4:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - ansible-test - Updated the ``pylint`` sanity test to skip some deprecation
        validation checks when all arguments are dynamic.
      - config - Preserve or apply Origin tag to values returned by config.
      - config - Prevented fatal errors when ``MODULE_IGNORE_EXTS`` configuration
        was set.
      - config - Templating failures on config defaults now issue a warning. Previously,
        failures silently returned an unrendered and untrusted template to the caller.
      - config - ``ensure_type`` correctly propagates trust and other tags on returned
        values.
      - config - ``ensure_type`` now converts mappings to ``dict`` when requested,
        instead of returning the mapping.
      - config - ``ensure_type`` now converts sequences to ``list`` when requested,
        instead of returning the sequence.
      - config - ``ensure_type`` now correctly errors when ``pathlist`` or ``pathspec``
        types encounter non-string list items.
      - config - ``ensure_type`` now reports an error when ``bytes`` are provided
        for any known ``value_type``. Previously, the behavior was undefined, but
        often resulted in an unhandled exception or incorrect return type.
      - config - ``ensure_type`` with expected type ``int`` now properly converts
        ``True`` and ``False`` values to ``int``. Previously, these values were silently
        returned unmodified.
      - convert_bool.boolean API conversion function - Unhashable values passed to
        ``boolean`` behave like other non-boolean convertible values, returning False
        or raising ``TypeError`` depending on the value of ``strict``. Previously,
        unhashable values always raised ``ValueError`` due to an invalid set membership
        check.
      - dnf5 - when ``bugfix`` and/or ``security`` is specified, skip packages that
        do not have any such updates, even for new versions of libdnf5 where this
        functionality changed and it is considered failure
      - plugin loader - Apply template trust to strings loaded from plugin configuration
        definitions and doc fragments.
      - template action - Template files where the entire file's output renders as
        ``None`` are no longer emitted as the string "None", but instead render to
        an empty file as in previous releases.
      minor_changes:
      - facts - add "CloudStack KVM Hypervisor" for Linux VM in virtual facts (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85089).
      - modules - use ``AnsibleModule.warn`` instead of passing ``warnings`` to ``exit_json``
        or ``fail_json`` which is deprecated.

  2.19.0b5:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Core Jinja test plugins - Builtin test plugins now always return ``bool``
        to avoid spurious deprecation warnings for some malformed inputs.
      - ansible-test - Disabled the ``bad-super-call`` pylint rule due to false positives.
      - ansible-test - Fix incorrect handling of options with optional args (e.g.
        ``--color``), when followed by other options which are omitted during arg
        filtering (e.g. ``--docker``). Previously it was possible for non-option arguments
        to be incorrectly omitted in these cases. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85173)
      - ansible-test - Improve type inference for pylint deprecated checks to accommodate
        some type annotations.
      - async_status module - The ``started`` and ``finished`` return values are now
        ``True`` or ``False`` instead of ``1`` or ``0``.
      - constructed inventory - Use the ``default_value`` or ``trailing_separator``
        in a ``keyed_groups`` entry if the expression result of ``key`` is ``None``
        and not just an empty string.
      - dnf5 - handle all libdnf5 specific exceptions (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84634)
      - error handling - Error details and tracebacks from connection and built-in
        action exceptions are preserved. Previously, much of the detail was lost or
        mixed into the error message.
      - from_yaml_all filter - `None` and empty string inputs now always return an
        empty list. Previously, `None` was returned in Jinja native mode and empty
        list in classic mode.
      - local connection plugin - The command-line used to create subprocesses is
        now always ``str`` to avoid issues with debuggers and profilers.
      - ssh agent - Fixed several potential startup hangs for badly-behaved or overloaded
        ssh agents.
      - task timeout - Specifying a negative task timeout now results in an error.
      deprecated_features:
      - The ``ShellModule.checksum`` method is now deprecated and will be removed
        in ansible-core 2.23. Use ``ActionBase._execute_remote_stat()`` instead.
      - The ``ansible.module_utils.common.collections.count()`` function is deprecated
        and will be removed in ansible-core 2.23. Use ``collections.Counter()`` from
        the Python standard library instead.
      - '``ansible.compat.importlib_resources`` is deprecated and will be removed
        in ansible-core 2.23. Use ``importlib.resources`` from the Python standard
        library instead.'
      minor_changes:
      - Improved SUSE distribution detection in distribution.py by parsing VARIANT_ID
        from /etc/os-release for identifying SLES_SAP and SL-Micro. Falls back to
        /etc/products.d/baseproduct symlink for older systems.
      - Remove unnecessary shebang from the ``hostname`` module.
      - Use ``importlib.metadata.version()`` to detect Jinja version as jinja2.__version__
        is deprecated and will be removed in Jinja 3.3.
      - ansible-doc - Return dynamic stub when reporting on Jinja filters and tests
        not explicitly documented in Ansible
      - ansible-doc - Skip listing the internal ``ansible._protomatter`` plugins unless
        explicitly requested
      - ansible-test - Add RHEL 10.0 as a remote platform for testing.
      - apt_repository - remove Python 2 support
      - csvfile lookup - remove Python 2 compat
      - display - Add ``help_text`` and ``obj`` to ``Display.error_as_warning``.
      - display - Replace Windows newlines (``\r\n``) in display output with Unix
        newlines (``\n``). This ensures proper display of strings sourced from Windows
        hosts in environments which treat ``\r`` as ``\n``, such as Azure Pipelines.
      - facts - add "Linode" for Linux VM in virtual facts
      - module_utils - Add ``AnsibleModule.error_as_warning``.
      - module_utils - Add ``ansible.module_utils.common.warnings.error_as_warning``.
      - module_utils - Add optional ``help_text`` argument to ``AnsibleModule.warn``.
      - ssh agent - Added ``SSH_AGENT_EXECUTABLE`` config to allow override of ssh-agent.
      - ssh connection plugin - Added ``verbosity`` config to decouple SSH debug output
        verbosity from Ansible verbosity. Previously, the Ansible verbosity value
        was always applied to the SSH client command-line, leading to excessively
        verbose output. Set the ``ANSIBLE_SSH_VERBOSITY`` envvar or ``ansible_ssh_verbosity``
        Ansible variable to a positive integer to increase SSH client verbosity.
      - task timeout - Specifying a timeout greater than 100,000,000 now results in
        an error.
      - templating - Added ``_ANSIBLE_TEMPLAR_SANDBOX_MODE=allow_unsafe_attributes``
        environment variable to disable Jinja template attribute sandbox. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85202)
      - windows - Added support for ``#AnsibleRequires -Wrapper`` to request a PowerShell
        module be run through the execution wrapper scripts without any module utils
        specified.
      - windows - Added support for running signed modules and scripts with a Windows
        host protected by Windows App Control/WDAC. This is a tech preview and the
        interface may be subject to change.
      - windows - Script modules will preserve UTF-8 encoding when executing the script.

  2.19.0b6:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix templating ``tags`` on plays and roles. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69903)
      - ansible-doc will no longer ignore docs for modules without an extension (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85279).
      - display - Fix hang caused by early post-fork writers to stdout/stderr (e.g.,
        pydevd) encountering an unreleased fork lock.
      - get_url - add a check to recognize incomplete data transfers.
      - include_tasks - fix templating options when used as a handler (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/85015).
      - templating - Fixed cases where template expression blocks halted prematurely
        when a Jinja macro invocation returned an undefined value.
      - templating - Jinja macros returned from a template expression can now be called
        from another template expression.
      minor_changes:
      - ansiballz - Added an experimental AnsiballZ extension for remote debugging.
      - ansiballz - Added support for AnsiballZ extensions.
      - ansiballz - Moved AnsiballZ code coverage support into an extension.
      - ansiballz - Refactored AnsiballZ and module respawn.
      - template action and lookup plugin - The value of the ``ansible_managed`` variable
        (if set) will not be masked by the ``template`` action and lookup. Previously,
        the value calculated by the ``DEFAULT_MANAGED_STR`` configuration option always
        masked the variable value during plugin execution, preventing runtime customization.

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - ansible-test - Fix Python relative import resolution from ``__init__.py``
        files when using change detection.
      - callback plugins - A more descriptive error is now raised if the stdout callback
        plugin cannot be loaded.
      - callback plugins - Callback plugins that do not extend ``ansible.plugins.callback.CallbackBase``
        will fail to load with a warning. If the plugin is used as the stdout callback
        plugin, this will also be a fatal error.
      - callback plugins - Removed unused methods - runner_on_no_hosts, playbook_on_setup,
        playbook_on_import_for_host, playbook_on_not_import_for_host, v2_playbook_on_cleanup_task_start,
        v2_playbook_on_import_for_host, v2_playbook_on_not_import_for_host.
      - callback plugins - The stdout callback plugin is no longer called twice if
        it is also in the list of additional callback plugins.
      - password lookup - fix acquiring the lock when human-readable FileExistsError
        error message is not English.
      - plugin loader - A warning is now emitted for any plugin which fails to load
        due to a missing base class.
      - variables - Added Jinja scalar singletons (``true``, ``false``, ``none``)
        to invalid Ansible variable name detection. Previously, variables with these
        names could be assigned without error, but could not be resolved.
      deprecated_features:
      - inventory plugins - Setting invalid Ansible variable names in inventory plugins
        is deprecated.
      - playbook syntax - Specifying the task ``args`` keyword without a value is
        deprecated.
      - playbook syntax - Using ``key=value`` args and the task ``args`` keyword on
        the same task is deprecated.
      - playbook syntax - Using a mapping with the ``action`` keyword is deprecated.
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84101)
      minor_changes:
      - Added type annotations to the ``Role.__init__()`` method to enable type checking.
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/85346)
      - ansible-test - Added experimental support for remote debugging.
      - ansible-test - Added support for setting static environment variables in integration
        tests using ``env/set/`` entries in the ``aliases`` file. For example, ``env/set/MY_KEY/MY_VALUE``
        or ``env/set/MY_PATH//an/abs/path``.
      - ansible-test - The ``shell`` command has been augmented to propagate remote
        debug configurations and other test-related settings when running on the controller.
        Use the ``--raw`` argument to bypass the additional environment configuration.
      - apt - consider lock timeout while invoking apt-get command (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78658).
      - assemble action added check_mode support
      - display - The ``formatted`` arg to ``warning`` has no effect. Warning wrapping
        is left to the consumer (e.g. terminal, browser).
      - display - The ``wrap_text`` and ``stderr`` arguments to ``error`` have no
        effect. Errors are always sent to stderr and wrapping is left to the consumer
        (e.g. terminal, browser).
      - module_utils.basic.backup_local enforces check_mode now
      - variables - Removed restriction on usage of most Python keywords as Ansible
        variable names.
      - variables - Warnings about reserved variable names now show context where
        the variable was defined.

      - YAML parsing - Usage of the YAML 1.1 ``!!omap`` and ``!!pairs`` tags is deprecated.
        Use standard mappings instead.
      - YAML parsing - Usage of the undocumented ``!vault-encrypted`` YAML tag is
        deprecated. Use ``!vault`` instead.
      - config - The ``DEFAULT_ALLOW_UNSAFE_LOOKUPS`` configuration option is deprecated
        and no longer has any effect. Ansible templating no longer encounters situations
        where use of lookup plugins is considered "unsafe".
      - config - The ``DEFAULT_UNDEFINED_VAR_BEHAVIOR`` configuration option is deprecated
        and no longer has any effect. Attempting to use an undefined variable where
        undefined values are unexpected is now always an error. This behavior was
        enabled by default in previous versions, and disabling it yielded inconsistent
        results.
      - config - The ``STRING_TYPE_FILTERS`` configuration option is deprecated and
        no longer has any effect. Since the template engine now always preserves native
        types, there is no longer a risk of unintended conversion from strings to
        native types.
      - config - Using the ``DEFAULT_JINJA2_EXTENSIONS`` configuration option to enable
        Jinja2 extensions is deprecated. Previously, custom Jinja extensions were
        disabled by default, as they can destabilize the Ansible templating environment.
        Templates should only make use of filter, test and lookup plugins.
      - config - Using the ``DEFAULT_MANAGED_STR`` configuration option to customize
        the value of the ``ansible_managed`` variable is deprecated. The ``ansible_managed``
        variable can now be set the same as any other variable.
      - playbook - The ``timedout.frame`` task result value (injected when a task
        timeout occurs) is deprecated. Include ``error`` in the ``DISPLAY_TRACEBACK``
        config value to capture a full Python traceback for timed out actions.
      - public API - The ``ansible.errors.AnsibleFilterTypeError`` exception type
        has been deprecated. Use ``AnsibleTypeError`` instead.
      - public API - The ``ansible.errors._AnsibleActionDone`` exception type has
        been deprecated. Action plugins should return a task result dictionary in
        success cases instead of raising.
      - public API - The ``ansible.module_utils.common.json.json_dump`` function is
        deprecated. Call Python stdlib ``json.dumps`` instead, with ``cls`` set to
        an Ansible profile encoder type from ``ansible.module_utils.common.json.get_encoder``.

  2.19.1rc1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - ansible-test - Always exclude the ``tests/output/`` directory from a collection's
        code coverage. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84244)
      - ansible-test - Limit package install retries during managed remote instance
        bootstrapping.
      - ansible-test - Use a consistent coverage config for all collection testing.
      - argspec validation - The ``str`` argspec type treats ``None`` values as empty
        string for better consistency with pre-2.19 templating conversions.
      - conditionals - When displaying a broken conditional error or deprecation warning,
        the origin of the non-boolean result is included (if available), and the raw
        result is omitted.
      - failed_when - When using ``failed_when`` to suppress an error, the ``exception``
        key in the result is renamed to ``failed_when_suppressed_exception``. This
        prevents the error from being displayed by callbacks after being suppressed.
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85505)
      - import_tasks - fix templating parent include arguments.
      - plugins config, get_option_and_origin now correctly displays the value and
        origin of the option.
      - template lookup - Skip finalization on the internal templating operation to
        allow markers to be returned and handled by, e.g. the ``default`` filter.
        Previously, finalization tripped markers, causing an exception to end processing
        of the current template pipeline. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85674)
      - templating - Avoid tripping markers within Jinja generated code. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85674)
      - templating - Ensure filter plugin result processing occurs under the correct
        call context. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85585)
      - templating - Fix slicing of tuples in templating (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85606).
      - templating - Multi-node template results coerce embedded ``None`` nodes to
        empty string (instead of rendering literal ``None`` to the output).
      - templating - Undefined marker values sourced from the Jinja ``getattr->getitem``
        fallback are now accessed correctly, raising AnsibleUndefinedVariable for
        user plugins that do not understand markers. Previously, these values were
        erroneously returned to user plugin code that had not opted in to marker acceptance.
      - tqm - use display.error_as_warning instead of display.warning_as_error.
      - tqm - use display.error_as_warning instead of self.warning.
      minor_changes:
      - AnsibleModule - Add temporary internal monkeypatch-able hook to alter module
        result serialization by splitting serialization from ``_return_formatted``
        into ``_record_module_result``.
      - ansible-test - Improve formatting of generated coverage config file.
      - ansible-test - Use OS packages to satisfy controller requirements on FreeBSD
        13.5 during managed instance bootstrapping.
      - encrypt - check datatype of salt_size in password_hash filter.
      - service_facts - handle keyerror exceptions with warning.
      - service_facts - warn user about missing service details instead of ignoring.

      - Fix traceback when trying to import non-existing file via nested ``import_tasks``
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69882)
      - SIGINT/SIGTERM Handling - Make SIGINT/SIGTERM handling more robust by splitting
        concerns between forks and the parent.
      - Windows - ignore temporary file cleanup warning when using AnsibleModule to
        compile C# utils. This should reduce the number of warnings that can safely
        be ignored when running PowerShell modules - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85976

      - Variable loading now uses file source instead of variables when invalidly
        formmated vars file is loaded.
      - ansible-test - The runtime-metadata sanity test now ignores pre-release and
        build identifiers in collection versions. This prevents errors if a tombstone
        version is ``X.0.0``, while the collection's version is ``X.0.0-prerelease``
