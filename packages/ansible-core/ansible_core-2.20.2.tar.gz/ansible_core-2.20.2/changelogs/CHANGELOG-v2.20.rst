v2.20.1
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2025-12-09
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.20/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.20.html>`__

Bugfixes

- Fix ``AnsibleModule.human_to_bytes()``, which was never adjusted after the standalone ``human_to_bytes()`` got a new parameter ``default_unit`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/85259).
- Variable loading now uses file source instead of variables when invalidly formmated vars file is loaded.
- ansible-test - The runtime-metadata sanity test now ignores pre-release and build identifiers in collection versions. This prevents errors if a tombstone version is ``X.0.0``, while the collection's version is ``X.0.0-prerelease`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85193)."
- display - Fix ``getuser`` fallback error handling on Python 3.13 and later. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/86142)

v2.20.0
=======

Release Summary
---------------

| Release Date: 2025-11-04
| `Porting Guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-core/2.20/porting_guides/porting_guide_core_2.20.html>`__

Major Changes
-------------

- ansible - Add support for Python 3.14.
- ansible - Drop support for Python 3.11 on the controller.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add tech preview play argument spec validation, which can be enabled by setting the play keyword ``validate_argspec`` to ``True`` or the name of an argument spec. When ``validate_argspec`` is set to ``True``, a play ``name`` is required and used as the argument spec name. When enabled, the argument spec is loaded from a file matching the pattern <playbook_name>.meta.yml. At minimum, this file should contain ``{"argument_specs": {"name": {"options": {}}}}``, where "name" is the name of the play or configured argument spec.
- Added Univention Corporate Server as a part of Debian OS distribution family (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85490).

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- powershell - Removed code that tried to remote quotes from paths when performing Windows operations like copying and fetching file. This should not affect normal playbooks unless a value is quoted too many times.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- Deprecated the shell plugin's ``wrap_for_exec`` function. This API is not used in Ansible or any known collection and is being removed to simplify the plugin API. Plugin authors should wrap their command to execute within an explicit shell or other known executable.
- INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS configuration currently defaults to ``True``, this is now deprecated and it will switch to ``False`` by Ansible 2.24. You will only get notified if you are accessing 'injected' facts (for example, ansible_os_distribution vs ansible_facts['os_distribution']).
- hash_params function in roles/__init__ is being deprecated as it is not in use.
- include_vars - Specifying 'ignore_files' as a string is deprecated.
- vars, the internal variable cache will be removed in 2.24. This cache, once used internally exposes variables in inconsistent states, the 'vars' and 'varnames' lookups should be used instead.

Removed Features (previously deprecated)
----------------------------------------

- Removed the option to set the ``DEFAULT_TRANSPORT`` configuration to ``smart`` that selects the default transport as either ``ssh`` or ``paramiko`` based on the underlying platform configuraton.
- ``vault``/``unvault`` filters - remove the deprecated ``vaultid`` parameter.
- ansible-doc - role entrypoint attributes are no longer shown
- ansible-galaxy - remove support for resolvelib >= 0.5.3, < 0.8.0.
- ansible-galaxy - removed the v2 Galaxy server API. Galaxy servers hosting collections must support v3.
- dnf/dnf5 - remove deprecated ``install_repoquery`` option.
- encrypt - remove deprecated passlib_or_crypt API.
- paramiko - Removed the ``PARAMIKO_HOST_KEY_AUTO_ADD`` and ``PARAMIKO_LOOK_FOR_KEYS`` configuration keys, which were previously deprecated.
- py3compat - remove deprecated ``py3compat.environ`` call.
- vars plugins - removed the deprecated ``get_host_vars`` or ``get_group_vars`` fallback for vars plugins that do not inherit from ``BaseVarsPlugin`` and define a ``get_vars`` method.
- yum_repository - remove deprecated ``keepcache`` option.

Bugfixes
--------

- Do not re-add ``tags`` on blocks from within ``import_tasks``.
- Fix issue where play tags prevented executing notified handlers (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85475)
- Fix issues with keywords being incorrectly validated on ``import_tasks`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85855, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85856)
- Fix traceback when trying to import non-existing file via nested ``import_tasks`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69882)
- SIGINT/SIGTERM Handling - Make SIGINT/SIGTERM handling more robust by splitting concerns between forks and the parent.
- The ``ansible_failed_task`` variable is now correctly exposed in a rescue section, even when a failing handler is triggered by the ``flush_handlers`` task in the corresponding ``block`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85682)
- Windows - ignore temporary file cleanup warning when using AnsibleModule to compile C# utils. This should reduce the number of warnings that can safely be ignored when running PowerShell modules - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85976
- Windows async - Handle running PowerShell modules with trailing data after the module result
- ``ansible-galaxy collection list`` - fail when none of the configured collection paths exist.
- ``ternary`` filter - evaluate values lazily (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85743)
- ansible-doc - prevent crash when scanning collections in paths that have more than one ``ansible_collections`` in it (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84909, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/85361).
- ansible-doc --list/--list_files/--metadata-dump - fixed relative imports in nested filter/test plugin files (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85753).
- ansible-galaxy - Use the provided import task url, instead of parsing to get the task id and reconstructing the URL
- ansible-galaxy no longer shows the internal protomatter collection when listing.
- ansible-test - Always exclude the ``tests/output/`` directory from a collection's code coverage. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84244)
- ansible-test - Fix a traceback that can occur when using delegation before the ansible-test temp directory is created.
- ansible-test - Limit package install retries during managed remote instance bootstrapping.
- ansible-test - Use a consistent coverage config for all collection testing.
- apt - mark dependencies installed as part of deb file installation as auto (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78123).
- argspec validation - The ``str`` argspec type treats ``None`` values as empty string for better consistency with pre-2.19 templating conversions.
- cache plugins - close temp cache file before moving it to fix error on WSL. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/85816)
- callback plugins - fix displaying the rendered ``ansible_host`` variable with ``delegate_to`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/84922).
- callback plugins - improve consistency accessing the Task object's resolved_action attribute.
- conditionals - When displaying a broken conditional error or deprecation warning, the origin of the non-boolean result is included (if available), and the raw result is omitted.
- config lookup now properly factors in variables and show_origin when checking entries from the global configuration.
- display - Fixed reference to undefined `_DeferredWarningContext` when issuing early warnings during startup. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85886)
- dnf - Check if installroot is directory or not (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85680).
- failed_when - When using ``failed_when`` to suppress an error, the ``exception`` key in the result is renamed to ``failed_when_suppressed_exception``. This prevents the error from being displayed by callbacks after being suppressed. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85505)
- fetch - also return ``file`` in the result when changed is ``True`` (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/85729).
- import_tasks - fix templating parent include arguments.
- include_role - allow host specific values in all ``*_from`` arguments (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66497)
- option argument deprecations now have a proper alternative help text.
- package_facts - typecast bytes to string while returning facts (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85937).
- pip - Fix pip module output so that it returns changed when the only operation is initializing a venv.
- plugins config, get_option_and_origin now correctly displays the value and origin of the option.
- psrp - ReadTimeout exceptions now mark host as unreachable instead of fatal (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85966)
- run_command - Fixed premature selector unregistration on empty read from stdout/stderr that caused truncated output or hangs in rare situations.
- script inventory plugin will now show correct 'incorrect' type when doing implicit conversions on groups.
- ssh connection - fix documented variables for the ``host`` option. Connection options can be configured with delegated variables in general.
- template lookup - Skip finalization on the internal templating operation to allow markers to be returned and handled by, e.g. the ``default`` filter. Previously, finalization tripped markers, causing an exception to end processing of the current template pipeline. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85674)
- templating - Avoid tripping markers within Jinja generated code. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85674)
- templating - Ensure filter plugin result processing occurs under the correct call context. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85585)
- templating - Fix slicing of tuples in templating (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85606).
- templating - Multi-node template results coerce embedded ``None`` nodes to empty string (instead of rendering literal ``None`` to the output).
- templating - Undefined marker values sourced from the Jinja ``getattr->getitem`` fallback are now accessed correctly, raising AnsibleUndefinedVariable for user plugins that do not understand markers. Previously, these values were erroneously returned to user plugin code that had not opted in to marker acceptance.
- tqm - use display.error_as_warning instead of display.warning_as_error.
- tqm - use display.error_as_warning instead of self.warning.
- uri - fix form-multipart file not being found when task is retried (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/85009)
- validate-modules sanity test - fix handling of missing doc fragments (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/85638).

Known Issues
------------

- templating - Exceptions raised in a Jinja ``set`` or ``with`` block which are not accessed by the template are ignored in the same manner as undefined values.
- templating - Passing a container created in a Jinja ``set`` or ``with`` block to a method results in a copy of that container. Mutations to that container which are not returned by the method will be discarded.
