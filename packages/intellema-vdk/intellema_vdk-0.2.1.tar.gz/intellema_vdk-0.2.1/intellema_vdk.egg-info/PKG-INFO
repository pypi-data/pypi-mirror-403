# Intellema VDK

Intellema VDK is a unified Voice Development Kit designed to simplify the integration and management of various voice agent platforms. It provides a consistent, factory-based API to interact with providers like LiveKit and Retell AI, enabling developers to build scalable voice applications with ease. Whether you need real-time streaming, outbound calling, or participant management, Intellema VDK abstracts the complexity into a single, intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Room Management**: Create and delete rooms dynamically.
- **Participant Management**: Generate tokens, kick users, and mute tracks.
- **SIP Outbound Calling**: Initiate calls to phone numbers via SIP trunks.
- **Streaming & Recording**: Stream to RTMP destinations and record room sessions directly to AWS S3.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Send data packets (alerts) to participants.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A SIP Provider (for outbound calls)

## Installation

```bash
pip install intellema-vdk
```

## Usage

### Unified Wrapper (Factory Pattern)

The recommended way to use the library is via the `VoiceClient` factory:

```python
import asyncio
from intellema_vdk import VoiceClient

async def main():
    # 1. Initialize the client
    client = VoiceClient("livekit") 

    # 2. Use methods directly
    call_id = await client.start_outbound_call(
        phone_number="+15551234567",
        prompt_content="Hello from LiveKit"
    )
    
    # 3. Clean API calls
    await client.mute_participant(call_id, "user-1", "track-1", True)
    await client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Convenience Function

For quick one-off calls, you can still use the helper:

```python
from intellema_vdk import start_outbound_call

await start_outbound_call("livekit", phone_number="+1...")
```

## Speech To Text (STT)

The `STTManager` class provides an interface for transcribing audio files using OpenAI's Whisper model and optionally posting the transcribed text to a specified agent API.

### Usage

Here's how to use the `STTManager` to transcribe an audio file and post the result:
Ensure to set OPENAI_API_KEY and AGENT_API_URL in your `.env` file.

```python
import asyncio
from intellema_vdk import STTManager

async def main():
    # 1- Initialize the STTManager
    stt_manager = STTManager()

    try:
        # 2- Transcribe an audio file and post the result to your agent API URL (if provided)
        # Replace "path/to/your/audio.mp3" with the actual file path
        transcript = await stt_manager.transcribe_and_post("path/to/your/audio.mp3")
        print(f"Transcription: {transcript}")

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("The audio file was not found.")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    finally:
        # 3- Clean up
        await stt_manager.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
    
## TTS Streaming 

The `TTSStreamer` class provides low-latency text-to-speech streaming using Together AI's inference engine. It enables real-time voice synthesis from streaming LLM responses.

### Running the Sample implementation

We provide a ready-to-use sample that connects LangChain (OpenAI) with the TTS Streamer.

1.  **Configure Keys**: Ensure `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `TOGETHER_API_KEY` are set in your `.env`.
2.  **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python sample_implementation.py
    ```

### Library Usage

You can integrate the streamer into your own loops:

```python
from intellema_vdk import TTSStreamer

# 1. Initialize per turn
tts = TTSStreamer()

# 2. Feed text chunks as they are generated
for chunk in llm_response_stream:
    tts.feed(chunk)

# 3. Flush and clean up
tts.flush()
tts.close()
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://your-livekit-domain.com
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your-key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your-secret
SIP_OUTBOUND_TRUNK_ID=your-trunk-id
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your-number
RETELL_API_KEY=your-retell-key
RETELL_AGENT_ID=your-agent-id
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your-together-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
AGENT_API_URL=https://your-agent-api.com/endpoint
```

## Retell Setup

**Important:** Before initiating calls with Retell, you must register your Twilio phone number with Retell. This binds your agent to the number and allows Retell to handle the call flow.

You can register your number in two ways:

1.  **Using the Helper Script:**
    We provide an interactive script to guide you through the process:
    ```bash
    python import_phone_number.py
    ```

2.  **Programmatically:**
    ```python
    from intellema_vdk.retell_lib.retell_client import RetellManager
    
    manager = RetellManager()
    # Optional: Pass termination_uri if you have a SIP trunk
    manager.import_phone_number(nickname="My Twilio Number")
    ```

## Notes

- **Retell `delete_room` Limitation**: The `delete_room` method for Retell relies on updating dynamic variables during the conversation loop. As a result, it **only works if the user speaks something** which triggers the agent to check the variable and terminate the call.
