It is designed to allow users to find photos for \"places\" and will round up to the nearest place type to which corresponding place IDs apply.For example, if you pass it a street level coordinate it will return the city that contains the point rather than the street, or building, itself.It will also truncate latitudes and longitudes to three decimal points.",
