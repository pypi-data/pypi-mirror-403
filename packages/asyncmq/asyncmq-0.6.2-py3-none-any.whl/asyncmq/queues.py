class Queue:
    """
    A high-level API for managing and interacting with a message queue.

    This class provides methods for enqueuing jobs, scheduling repeatable tasks,
    controlling worker behavior (pause/resume), cleaning up jobs, and running
    a worker process to consume jobs from the queue. It acts as the primary
    interface for users to interact with the asyncmq system.

    Key Features:
    - Add single jobs (`add`) or multiple jobs in bulk (`add_bulk`).
    - Schedule jobs to repeat at regular intervals (`add_repeatable`).
    - Control queue processing state (`pause`, `resume`).
    - Clean up jobs based on state and age (`clean`).
    - Start a worker process to consume jobs from this queue (`run`, `start`).
