Welcome to **AsyncMQ**, the modern task queue that brings **powerful**, **flexible**, and **lightning-fast** background processing to your Python stack. Whether you're building microservices, handling high-throughput data pipelines, or just want reliable delayed jobs, AsyncMQ has your back.

## 🚀 Why Choose AsyncMQ?

1. **Asyncio & AnyIO-Native**
   No more wrestling with threads or callbacks—AsyncMQ is built on `asyncio` and `anyio`, so your tasks are non-blocking and integrate seamlessly into modern async frameworks like FastAPI and Esmerald.

2. **Multi-Backend Flexibility**
   From the blistering speed of Redis to the ACID guarantees of Postgres, or the schema-less power of MongoDB, AsyncMQ supports multiple backends out of the box—and you can write your own by implementing `BaseBackend`.

3. **Advanced Scheduling**

   * **Delayed Jobs**: Fire off tasks in the future with precise delays.
   * **Repeatable & Cron**: Create heartbeat jobs or cron-like schedules with a single line.
   * **Scan & Scheduler**: Smart polling intervals and cron logic keep your timings accurate without burning CPU cycles.

4. **Robust Error Handling**

   * **Retries & Backoff**: Exponential or custom backoff strategies to gracefully handle failures.
   * **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**: Automatically route permanently failed tasks for later inspection and reprocessing.

5. **Observability & Event Hooks**
   Tap into lifecycle events (`job:started`, `job:completed`, `job:failed`, `job:progress`) to power real-time dashboards, metrics, or custom alerts.

6. **Rate Limiting & Concurrency Control**
   Fine-tune throughput with token-bucket rate limiting and capacity limiters. Scale your worker concurrency without overloading downstream systems.

7. **Sandboxed Execution**
   Run untrusted or CPU-bound tasks in isolated subprocesses with timeouts to protect your main workers from rogue code or infinite loops.

8. **Flow/DAG Orchestration**
   Create complex task graphs with dependencies using `FlowProducer`. Enqueue entire pipelines atomically or fall back to safe sequential logic.

9. **CLI & Dev Experience**
   A feature-rich CLI for managing queues, jobs, and workers—intuitive commands, JSON output support, and built-in help for every scenario.

10. **Seamless ASGI Integration**
    Out-of-the-box compatibility with FastAPI, Esmerald, or any ASGI application. Manage workers within your app's lifecycle events.

## Installation

AsyncMQ requires Python 3.10+ to run and that its because the EOL will be later on only.

You can install in many different ways, the default brings `redis` to use with `RedisBackend`.

```shell
$ pip install asyncmq
```

**Postgres**

If you prefer the Postgres backend.

```shell
$ pip install asyncmq[postgres]
```

**Mongo DB**

You might want also Mongo DB backend.

```shell
$ pip install asyncmq[mongo]
```

**All in one go**

You might want to install everything and see what is the best for you.

```shell
$ pip install asyncmq[all]
```

### Dashboard

AsyncMQ comes with a dashboard and that requires some additional setup but nothing special but to install it.

### Where **AsyncMQ** Shines

* **True AsyncIO & AnyIO integration**: zero thread hacks, full non-blocking background tasks.
* **Backend flexibility**: swap Redis, Postgres, MongoDB, or In-Memory with a single setting.
* **Built-in rate limiting & concurrency control**: protect downstream services out-of-the-box.
* **Event-driven hooks**: subscribe to `job:started`, `completed`, `failed`, `progress`, etc., for metrics and alerts.
* **ASGI integration**: manage workers within FastAPI or Esmerald lifecycles—no extra wrappers needed.

## 🎬 Quickstart

1. **Install**

   ```bash
   pip install asyncmq
   ```
2. **Configure**

   Override the default settings `from asyncmq import monkay` and create your own, then make it global.

   ```bash
   export ASYNCMQ_SETTINGS_MODULE=myapp.settings.Settings
   ```
3. **Define a Task**

   ```python
   from asyncmq.tasks import task

   @task(queue="emails", retries=2, ttl=120)
   async def send_welcome(email: str):
       # Imagine real email-sending logic here
       print(f"📧 Sent welcome to {email}")
   ```
4. **Enqueue & Run**

   ```python
   import anyio
   from asyncmq.queues import Queue

   async def main():
       q = Queue("emails")
       await send_welcome.enqueue(q.backend, "alice@example.com", delay=10)
   anyio.run(main)
   ```
5. **Start Workers**

   ```bash
   asyncmq worker start emails --concurrency 5
   ```
