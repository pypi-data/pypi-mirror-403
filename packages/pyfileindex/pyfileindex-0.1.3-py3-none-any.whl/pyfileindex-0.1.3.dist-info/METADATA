The pyfileindex helps to keep track of files in a specific directory, to monitor added files, modified files and deleted files. The module is compatible with Python 3.7 or later but restricted to Unix-like system - Windows is not supported. 

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyiron/pyfileindex/main/pyfileindex.gif)

# Installation
The pyfileindex can either be installed via pip using:
```shell
pip install pyfileindex
```
Or via anaconda from the conda-forge channel
```shell
conda install -c conda-forge pyfileindex
```

# Usage 
Import pyfileindex:
```python
from pyfileindex import PyFileIndex 
pfi = PyFileIndex(path='.')
```  
Or you can filter for a specifc file extension: 
```python
def filter_function(file_name):
    return '.txt' in file_name
    
pfi = PyFileIndex(path='.', filter_function=filter_function)
```
List files in the file system index: 
```python
pfi.dataframe 
```
Update file system index: 
```python
pfi.update()
```
And open a subdirectory using: 
```python
pfi.open(path='subdirectory')
```
For more details, take a look at the example notebook: https://github.com/pyiron/pyfileindex/blob/main/notebooks/demo.ipynb
