        Create CDN resource

        Args:
          cname: Delivery domains that will be used for content delivery through a CDN.

              Delivery domains should be added to your DNS settings.

          origin: IP address or domain name of the origin and the port, if custom port is used.

              You can use either the `origin` or `originGroup` parameter in the request.

          origin_group: Origin group ID with which the CDN resource is associated.

              You can use either the `origin` or `originGroup` parameter in the request.

          active: Enables or disables a CDN resource.

              Possible values:

              - **true** - CDN resource is active. Content is being delivered.
              - **false** - CDN resource is deactivated. Content is not being delivered.

          description: Optional comment describing the CDN resource.

          name: CDN resource name.

          options: List of options that can be configured for the CDN resource.

              In case of `null` value the option is not added to the CDN resource. Option may
              inherit its value from the global account settings.

          origin_protocol: Protocol used by CDN servers to request content from an origin source.

              Possible values:

              - **HTTPS** - CDN servers will connect to the origin via HTTPS.
              - **HTTP** - CDN servers will connect to the origin via HTTP.
              - **MATCH** - connection protocol will be chosen automatically (content on the
                origin source should be available for the CDN both through HTTP and HTTPS).

              If protocol is not specified, HTTP is used to connect to an origin server.

          primary_resource: ID of the main CDN resource which has a shared caching zone with a reserve CDN
              resource.

              If the parameter is not empty, then the current CDN resource is the reserve. You
              cannot change some options, create rules, set up origin shielding, or use the
              reserve CDN resource for Streaming.

          proxy_ssl_ca: ID of the trusted CA certificate used to verify an origin.

              It can be used only with `"proxy_ssl_enabled": true`.

          proxy_ssl_data: ID of the SSL certificate used to verify an origin.

              It can be used only with `"proxy_ssl_enabled": true`.

          proxy_ssl_enabled: Enables or disables SSL certificate validation of the origin server before
              completing any connection.

              Possible values:

              - **true** - Origin SSL certificate validation is enabled.
              - **false** - Origin SSL certificate validation is disabled.

          secondary_hostnames: Additional delivery domains (CNAMEs) that will be used to deliver content via
              the CDN.

              Up to ten additional CNAMEs are possible.

          ssl_data: ID of the SSL certificate linked to the CDN resource.

              Can be used only with `"sslEnabled": true`.

          ssl_enabled: Defines whether the HTTPS protocol enabled for content delivery.

              Possible values:

              - **true** - HTTPS is enabled.
              - **false** - HTTPS is disabled.

          waap_api_domain_enabled: Defines whether the associated WAAP Domain is identified as an API Domain.

              Possible values:

              - **true** - The associated WAAP Domain is designated as an API Domain.
              - **false** - The associated WAAP Domain is not designated as an API Domain.

              Delivery domains should be added to your DNS settings.

          origin: IP address or domain name of the origin and the port, if custom port is used.

              You can use either the `origin` or `originGroup` parameter in the request.

          origin_group: Origin group ID with which the CDN resource is associated.

              You can use either the `origin` or `originGroup` parameter in the request.

          active: Enables or disables a CDN resource.

              Possible values:

              - **true** - CDN resource is active. Content is being delivered.
              - **false** - CDN resource is deactivated. Content is not being delivered.

          description: Optional comment describing the CDN resource.

          name: CDN resource name.

          options: List of options that can be configured for the CDN resource.

              In case of `null` value the option is not added to the CDN resource. Option may
              inherit its value from the global account settings.

          origin_protocol: Protocol used by CDN servers to request content from an origin source.

              Possible values:

              - **HTTPS** - CDN servers will connect to the origin via HTTPS.
              - **HTTP** - CDN servers will connect to the origin via HTTP.
              - **MATCH** - connection protocol will be chosen automatically (content on the
                origin source should be available for the CDN both through HTTP and HTTPS).

              If protocol is not specified, HTTP is used to connect to an origin server.

          primary_resource: ID of the main CDN resource which has a shared caching zone with a reserve CDN
              resource.

              If the parameter is not empty, then the current CDN resource is the reserve. You
              cannot change some options, create rules, set up origin shielding, or use the
              reserve CDN resource for Streaming.

          proxy_ssl_ca: ID of the trusted CA certificate used to verify an origin.

              It can be used only with `"proxy_ssl_enabled": true`.

              It can be used only with `"proxy_ssl_enabled": true`.

          proxy_ssl_enabled: Enables or disables SSL certificate validation of the origin server before
              completing any connection.

              Possible values:

              - **true** - Origin SSL certificate validation is enabled.
              - **false** - Origin SSL certificate validation is disabled.

          secondary_hostnames: Additional delivery domains (CNAMEs) that will be used to deliver content via
              the CDN.

              Up to ten additional CNAMEs are possible.

          ssl_data: ID of the SSL certificate linked to the CDN resource.

              Can be used only with `"sslEnabled": true`.

          ssl_enabled: Defines whether the HTTPS protocol enabled for content delivery.

              Possible values:

              - **true** - HTTPS is enabled.
              - **false** - HTTPS is disabled.

              3. "ignoreQueryString" is used. Don’t specify parameters in the purge request.
              4. "query_params_blacklist" is used. Only files with the listed in the option
                 parameters will be cached as different objects. Files with other parameters
                 will be cached as one object. In this case, specify the listed parameters in

                 will be cached as one object. Files with other parameters will be cached as
                 different objects. In this case, specify other parameters (if any) besides
