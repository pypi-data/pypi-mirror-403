              The rule is applied if the requested URI matches the rule path.

              We add a leading forward slash to any rule path. Specify a path without a
              forward slash.

          rule_type: Rule type.

              Possible values:

              - **Type 0** - Regular expression. Must start with '^/' or '/'.
              - **Type 1** - Regular expression. Note that for this rule type we automatically

              Possible values:

              - **HTTP** - CDN servers connect to origin via HTTP protocol.

              - **Type 0** - Regular expression. Must start with '^/' or '/'.
