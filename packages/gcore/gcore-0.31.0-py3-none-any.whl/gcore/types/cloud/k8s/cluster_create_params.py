    It allows you to override the default cluster-autoscaler parameters provided by
    the platform with your preferred values.

    Supported parameters (in alphabetical order):

    - balance-similar-node-groups (boolean: true/false) - Detect similar node groups
      and balance the number of nodes between them.
    - expander (string: random, most-pods, least-waste, price, priority, grpc) -
      Type of node group expander to be used in scale up. Specifying multiple values
      separated by commas will call the expanders in succession until there is only
      one option remaining.
    - expendable-pods-priority-cutoff (float) - Pods with priority below cutoff will
      be expendable. They can be killed without any consideration during scale down
      and they don't cause scale up. Pods with null priority (PodPriority disabled)
      are non expendable.
    - ignore-daemonsets-utilization (boolean: true/false) - Should CA ignore
      DaemonSet pods when calculating resource utilization for scaling down.
    - max-empty-bulk-delete (integer) - Maximum number of empty nodes that can be
      deleted at the same time.
    - max-graceful-termination-sec (integer) - Maximum number of seconds CA waits
      for pod termination when trying to scale down a node.
    - max-node-provision-time (duration: e.g., '15m') - The default maximum time CA
      waits for node to be provisioned - the value can be overridden per node group.
    - max-total-unready-percentage (float) - Maximum percentage of unready nodes in
      the cluster. After this is exceeded, CA halts operations.
    - new-pod-scale-up-delay (duration: e.g., '10s') - Pods less than this old will
      not be considered for scale-up. Can be increased for individual pods through
      annotation.
    - ok-total-unready-count (integer) - Number of allowed unready nodes,
      irrespective of max-total-unready-percentage.
    - scale-down-delay-after-add (duration: e.g., '10m') - How long after scale up
      that scale down evaluation resumes.
    - scale-down-delay-after-delete (duration: e.g., '10s') - How long after node
      deletion that scale down evaluation resumes.
    - scale-down-delay-after-failure (duration: e.g., '3m') - How long after scale
      down failure that scale down evaluation resumes.
    - scale-down-enabled (boolean: true/false) - Should CA scale down the cluster.
    - scale-down-unneeded-time (duration: e.g., '10m') - How long a node should be
      unneeded before it is eligible for scale down.
    - scale-down-unready-time (duration: e.g., '20m') - How long an unready node
      should be unneeded before it is eligible for scale down.
    - scale-down-utilization-threshold (float) - The maximum value between the sum
      of cpu requests and sum of memory requests of all pods running on the node
      divided by node's corresponding allocatable resource, below which a node can
      be considered for scale down.
    - scan-interval (duration: e.g., '10s') - How often cluster is reevaluated for
      scale up or down.
    - skip-nodes-with-custom-controller-pods (boolean: true/false) - If true cluster
      autoscaler will never delete nodes with pods owned by custom controllers.
    - skip-nodes-with-local-storage (boolean: true/false) - If true cluster
      autoscaler will never delete nodes with pods with local storage, e.g. EmptyDir
      or HostPath.
    - skip-nodes-with-system-pods (boolean: true/false) - If true cluster autoscaler
      will never delete nodes with pods from kube-system (except for DaemonSet or
      mirror pods).
