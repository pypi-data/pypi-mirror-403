    """

    mp4_url: Optional[str] = None
    """
    A URL to a rendition file of the specified quality in MP4 format for
    downloading.

    **Download methods**

    For each converted video, additional download endpoints are available under
    `converted_videos`/`mp4_urls`. An MP4 download enpoints:

    1. `/videos/{client_id}_{slug}/{filename}.mp4`
    2. `/videos/{client_id}_{slug}/{filename}.mp4/download`
    3. `/videos/{client_id}_{slug}/{filename}.mp4/download={custom_filename}`

    The first option returns the file as is. Response will be:

    ```
    GET .mp4
    ...
    content-type: video/mp4
    ```

    The second option with `/download` will respond with HTTP response header that
    directly tells browsers to download the file instead of playing it in the
    browser:

    ```
    GET .mp4/download
    ...
    content-type: video/mp4
    content-disposition: attachment
    access-control-expose-headers: Content-Disposition
    ```

    The third option allows you to set a custom name for the file being downloaded.
    You can optionally specify a custom filename (just name excluding the .mp4
    extension) using the download= query.

    Filename constraints:

    - Length: 1-255 characters
    - Must NOT include the .mp4 extension (it is added automatically)
    - Allowed characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, \\__(underscore), -(dash), .(dot)
    - First character cannot be .(dot)
    - Example valid filenames: `holiday2025`, `_backup.final`, `clip-v1.2`

    ```
    GET .mp4/download={custom_filename}
    ...
    content-type: video/mp4
    content-disposition: attachment; filename="{custom_filename}.mp4"
    access-control-expose-headers: Content-Disposition
    ```

    Examples:

    - MP4:
      `https://demo-public.gvideo.io/videos/2675_1OFgHZ1FWZNNvx1A/qid3567v1_h264_4050_1080.mp4/download`
    - MP4 with custom download filename:
      `https://demo-public.gvideo.io/videos/2675_1OFgHZ1FWZNNvx1A/qid3567v1_h264_4050_1080.mp4/download=highlights_v1.1_2025-05-30`

    **Default MP4 file name structure**

    Link to the file {filename} contains information about the encoding method using
    format:

    `<quality_version>_<codec>_<bitrate>_<height>.mp4`

    - `<quality_version>` – Internal quality identifier and file version. Please do
      not use it, can be changed at any time without any notice.
    - `<codec>` – Codec name that was used to encode the video, or audio codec if it
      is an audio-only file.
    - `<bitrate>` – Encoding bitrate in Kbps.
    - `<height>` – Video height, or word "audio" if it is an audio-only file.

    Note that this link format has been applied since 14.08.2024. If the video
    entity was uploaded earlier, links may have old simplified format.

    Example: `/videos/{client_id}_{slug}/qid3567v1_h264_4050_1080.mp4`

    **Dynamic speed limiting** This mode sets different limits for different users
    or for different types of content. The speed is adjusted based on requests with
    the “speed” and “buffer” arguments.

    Example: `?speed=50k&buffer=500k`

    Read more in Product Documentation in CDN section "Network limits".

    **Secure token authentication for MP4 (updated)**

    Access to MP4 download links only can be protected using advanced secure tokens
    passed as query parameters.

    Token generation uses the entire MP4 path, which ensures the token only grants
    access to a specific quality/version of the video. This prevents unintended
    access to other bitrate versions of an ABR stream.

    Token Query Parameters:

    - token: The generated hash
    - expires: Expiration timestamp
    - speed: (optional) Speed limit in bytes/sec, or empty string
    - buffer: (optional) Buffer size in bytes, or empty string

    Optional (for IP-bound tokens):

    - ip: The user’s IP address Example:
      `?md5=QX39c77lbQKvYgMMAvpyMQ&expires=1743167062`

    ABR soft-limiting: Soft limitation of the list of qualities allows you to return

    need. For example, the video is available in 7 qualities from 360p to 4K, but
    you want to return not more than 480p only due to the conditions of distribution
    of content to a specific end-user (i.e. free account): ABR soft-limiting

    - To a generic `.../master.m3u8` manifest
    - Add a suffix-option to limit quality `.../master-max-480.m3u8`
    - Add a suffix-option to limit quality and codec
