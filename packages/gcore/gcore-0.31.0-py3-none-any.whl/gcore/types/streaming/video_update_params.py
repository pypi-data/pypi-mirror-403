      settings in your account. If generation is activated, then automatic language
      detection while transcribing.
    - \\  – Transcribe from specific language. Can be used to specify the exact
      language spoken in the audio track, or when auto language detection fails.
      Language is set by 3-letter language code according to ISO-639-2

    Please note that subtitle translation is done separately and after
    transcription. Thus separate AI-tasks are created for translation.

    source_bitrate_limit: bool

    The option allows you to set the video transcoding rule so that the output
    bitrate in ABR ladder is not exceeding the bitrate of the original video.

    This option is for advanced users only.

    By default `source_bitrate_limit: true` this option allows you to have the
    output bitrate not more than in the original video, thus to transcode video
    faster and to deliver it to end-viewers faster as well. At the same time, the
    quality will be similar to the original.

    If for some reason you need more byte-space in the output quality when encoding,
    you can set this option to `source_bitrate_limit: false`. Then, when
    transcoding, the quality ceiling will be raised from the bitrate of the original
    video to the maximum possible limit specified in our the Product Documentation.
    For example, this may be needed when:

    - to improve the visual quality parameters using PSNR, SSIM, VMAF metrics,
    - to improve the picture quality on dynamic scenes,
    - etc.

    The option is applied only at the video creation stage and cannot be changed
    later. If you want to re-transcode the video using new value, then you need to
    create and upload a new video only.
