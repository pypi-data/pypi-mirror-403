    Please, note that cutting is based on the idea of instantly creating a clip,
    instead of precise timing. So final segment may be:

    - Less than the specified value if there is less data in the DVR than the
      requested segment.
    - Greater than the specified value, because segment is aligned to the first and
      last key frames of already stored fragment in DVR, this way -1 and +1 chunks
      can be added to left and right.

    Duration of cutted segment cannot be greater than DVR duration for this stream.
    Therefore, to change the maximum, use "dvr_duration" parameter of this stream.

    Unix timestamp in seconds, absolute value.

    This is the time how long the instant clip will be stored in the server memory
    and can be accessed via public HLS/MP4 links. Download and/or use the instant
    clip before this time expires.

    After the time has expired, the clip is deleted from memory and is no longer
    available via the link. You need to create a new segment, or use
    `vod_required: true` attribute.

    If value is omitted, then expiration is counted as +3600 seconds (1 hour) to the
    end of the clip (i.e. `unix timestamp = <start> + <duration> + 3600`).

    Allowed range: 1m <= expiration <= 4h.

    Example:
    `24.05.2024 14:00:00 (GMT) + 60 seconds of duration + 3600 seconds of expiration = 24.05.2024 15:01:00 (GMT) is Unix timestamp = 1716562860`
