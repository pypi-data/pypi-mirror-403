      string with the "duration_sec" attribute. The value is an integer for a length
      multiple of whole seconds, or a fractional number separated by a dot for

    **Setup SRT latency on your sender side**

    SRT is designed as a low-latency transport protocol, but real networks are not
    always stable and in some cases the end-to-end path from the venue to the ingest
    point can be long. For this reason, it is important to configure the latency
    parameter carefully to match the actual network conditions.

    Small latency values may lead to packet loss when jitter or retransmissions
    occur, while very large values introduce unnecessary end-to-end delay.

    _Incorrect or low default value is one of the most common reasons for packet
    loss, frames loss, and bad picture._

    We therefore recommend setting latency manually rather than relying on the
    default, to ensure the buffer is correctly sized for your environment. A
    practical range is 400–2000 ms, with the exact value chosen based on RTT,
    jitter, and expected packet loss.

    Be sure to check and test SRT settings on your sender side. The default values
    do not take into account your specific scenarios and do not work well. If
    necessary, ask us and we will help you.

    Please note that 1 connection and 1 protocol can be used at a single moment in
    time per unique stream key input. Trying to send 2+ connection requests into the
    single `push_url_srt`, or 2+ protocols at once will not lead to a result.

    For example, transcoding process will fail if:

    - you are pushing primary and backup SRT to the same single `push_url_srt`
      simultaneously
    - you are pushing RTMP to `push_url` and SRT to `push_url_srt` simultaneously

    See more information and best practices about SRT protocol in the Product
    Documentation.

    push_url_whip: Optional[str] = None
    """URL to PUSH WebRTC stream to our server using WHIP protocol.

    **WebRTC WHIP to LL-HLS and DASH**

    Video Streaming supports WebRTC HTTP Ingest Protocol (WHIP), and WebRTC to
    HLS/DASH converter. As a result you can stream from web broswers natively.

    **WebRTC WHIP server**

    We have dedicated WebRTC WHIP servers in our infrastructure. WebRTC WHIP server
    organizes both signaling and receives video data. Signaling is a term to
    describe communication between WebRTC endpoints, needed to initiate and maintain
    a session. WHIP is an open specification for a simple signaling protocol for
    starting WebRTC sessions in an outgoing direction, (i.e., streaming from your
    device).

    There is the primary link only for WHIP, so no backup link.

    **WebRTC stream encoding parameters**

    At least one video and audio track both must be present in the stream:

    - Video must be encoded with H.264.
    - Audio must be encoded with OPUS.

    Note. Specifically for WebRTC mode a method of constant transcoding with an
    initial given resolution is used. This means that if WebRTC in the end-user's
    browser decides to reduce the quality or resolution of the master stream (to let
    say 360p) due to restrictions on the end-user's device (network conditions, CPU
    consumption, etc.), the transcoder will still continue to transcode the reduced
    stream to the initial resolution (let say 1080p ABR). When the restrictions on
    the end-user's device are removed, quiality will improve again.

    **WebRTC WHIP Client**

    We provide a convenient WebRTC WHIP library for working in browsers. You can use
    our library, or any other you prefer. Simple example of usage is here:
    https://stackblitz.com/edit/stackblitz-starters-j2r9ar?file=index.html

    Also try to use the feature in UI of the Customer Portal. In the Streaming
    section inside the settings of a specific live stream, a new section "Quick
    start in browser" has been added.

    Please note that 1 connection and 1 protocol can be used at a single moment in
    time per unique stream key input. Trying to send 2+ connection requests into the
