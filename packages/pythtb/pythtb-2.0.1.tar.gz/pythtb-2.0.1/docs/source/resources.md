## User-Contributed Extensions

A website has been set up to maintain links to potentially
useful PythTB software contributed by users. This may include
implementations of additional capabilities, useful function definitions,
sample scripts, plotting routines, etc. These are not necessarily
sanctioned by the developers of PythTB, and should be tested
carefully before use.
