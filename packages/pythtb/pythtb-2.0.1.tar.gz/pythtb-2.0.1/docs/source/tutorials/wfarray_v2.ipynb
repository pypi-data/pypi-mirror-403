    "## Initializing and populating a `WFArray`\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous versions of PythTB, the `wf_array` class was tightly coupled to the `tb_model` class. Upon initializing a `wf_array`, `wf_array` would read off the lattice information from the associated `tb_model`. In v2.0, like in `TBModel`, we will instead explicitly pass a `Lattice` object to the `WFArray` constructor. Aside from increased flexibility, this also allows us to create `WFArray` objects that are not tied to any specific `TBModel`. For instance, one may want to store states that are derived from `TBModel`s on an adiabatic cycle, which there is no single `TBModel` that describes all the states.\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# v1.x\n",
    "from pythtb import tb_model, wf_array\n",

    "wfa.solve_on_grid(0.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In `solve_on_grid`, the `wf_array` will generate the k-point mesh and populate itself with the wavefunctions from `model`. Afterwords the mesh is discarded and the `wf_array` only retains the wavefunction data. This loses the information about the k-point structure, and requires the user to manually keep track of the k-point mesh if needed.\n",
