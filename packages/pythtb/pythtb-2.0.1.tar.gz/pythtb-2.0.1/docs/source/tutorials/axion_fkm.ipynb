    "The **axion angle** $\\theta$ characterizes the isotropic magnetoelectric response of a three-dimensional insulator. When $\\theta$ evolves adiabatically along a closed cycle of a control parameter $\\lambda$, its change is quantized and proportional to the **second Chern number** of the occupied bands. This is the 4D analogue of Thouless charge pumping: just as a 1D insulator pumps an integer *charge* over a cycle (first Chern number), a 3D insulator can pump a quantized *axion angle* governed by a second-Chern invariant.\n",

In the presence of time-reversal and inversion symmetry, the axion angle is quantized to either 0 or $\\pi$ (mod $2\\pi$), corresponding to trivial and non-trivial topological phases, respectively. Introducing an adiabatic parameter $\\beta$ breaks these symmetries for $\\beta \\neq n \\pi$, allowing $\\theta(\\beta)$ to vary continuously between these quantized limits. We sweep $\\beta$ over a $2\\pi$ cycle, compute $\\theta(\\beta)$ using `TBModel.axion_angle`, and verify the expected $2\\pi$ pump corresponding to a unit second Chern number.\n",
