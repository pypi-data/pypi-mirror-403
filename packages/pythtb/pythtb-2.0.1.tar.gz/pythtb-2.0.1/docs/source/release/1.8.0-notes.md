# PythTB 1.8.0 Release Notes

## Changed

- Enhanced `wf_array` to support storage of states beyond Bloch-like eigenstates, improving flexibility for custom workflows.
- Miscellaneous minor improvements and stability fixes.

## Added

- Extended `wf_array` with new convenience methods:
- `solve_on_one_point` — evaluate eigenstates at a single mesh point
- `choose_states` — select subsets of states for downstream analysis
- `empty_like` — construct an empty array mirroring an existing `wf_array` structure
- Introduced `change_nonperiodic_vector`, and refined handling of the `to_home` parameter to better control real-space shifts in models with non-periodic directions.

## Removed
Retired legacy functions that had been kept for backward compatibility. These features have modern equivalents elsewhere in the API:
- `berry_curv`
- `k_path`
- `tbmodel`
- `set_sites`
- `add_hop`
