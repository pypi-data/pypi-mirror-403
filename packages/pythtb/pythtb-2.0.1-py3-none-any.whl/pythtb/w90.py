class W90:
    r"""Interface to Wannier90

    `Wannier90 <http://www.wannier.org>`_ is a post-processing tool
    that takes as input Bloch wavefunctions and energies generated
    by first-principles electronic structure codes such as
    Quantum-Espresso (PWscf), ABINIT, SIESTA, FLEUR,
    WIEN2k, or VASP. It produces maximally localized Wannier functions
    together with a tight-binding Hamiltonian in the Wannier basis [1]_.

    This class imports tight-binding model parameters from a
    Wannier90 calculation and makes them available in PythTB.
    Upon construction, it reads the relevant Wannier90 output
    files from the specified directory. Use :meth:`model` to
    convert the imported data into a :class:`TBModel` instance.

    The PythTB interface uses the following Wannier90 output files:

    - ``prefix.win``
    - ``prefix_hr.dat``
    - ``prefix_centres.xyz``
    - ``prefix_band.kpt`` (optional)
    - ``prefix_band.dat`` (optional)

    The ``prefix.win`` file provides general input to Wannier90 and is here
    primarily to obtain the lattice vectors.

    To ensure the required files ``prefix_hr.dat`` and ``prefix_centres.xyz``
    are written, include the following flags in the ``prefix.win`` file::

       write_hr = True
       write_xyz = True
       translate_home_cell = False

    These directives instruct Wannier90 to output (i) the real-space
    tight-binding Hamiltonian in ``prefix_hr.dat`` and (ii) the centers of
    the Wannier functions in ``prefix_centres.xyz`` without translating
    them to the home unit cell.

    The optional files ``prefix_band.kpt`` and ``prefix_band.dat``
    can be used to import the Wannier-interpolated band structures
    computed by Wannier90. Please see documentation of function
    :meth:`bands_w90` for more detail.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str
        Relative path to the folder that contains Wannier90
        files. These are ``prefix.win``, ``prefix_hr.dat``,
        ``prefix_centres.xyz`` and optionally ``prefix_band.kpt`` and
        ``prefix_band.dat``.

    prefix : str
        This is the prefix used by `Wannier90` code.
        Typically the input to the `Wannier90` code is name ``prefix.win``.

    Notes
    -----
    Units used throught this interface with Wannier90 are
    electron-volts (eV) and Angstroms.

    .. warning::
        This class has been tested on Wannier90 v3.1.0. Compatibility
        with other versions is not guaranteed.

    .. warning::
        The user needs to make sure that the Wannier functions
        computed using Wannier90 code are well localized. Otherwise the
        tight-binding model may not accurately interpolate the band
        structure. To ensure that the Wannier functions are well
        localized it is often enough to check that the total spread at
        the beginning of the minimization procedure (first total spread
        printed in .wout file) is not more than 20% larger than the
        total spread at the end of the minimization procedure. If those
        spreads differ by much more than 20% user needs to specify
        better initial projection functions.

    .. warning::
        The interpolation is only exact within the frozen energy window
        of the disentanglement procedure.

    .. warning::
        So far PythTB assumes that the position operator is
        diagonal in the tight-binding basis. This is discussed in the
        :download:`notes on tight-binding formalism
        </_static/formalism/pythtb-formalism.pdf>` in Eq. 2.7.,
        :math:`\langle\phi_{{\bf R} i} \vert {\bf r} \vert \phi_{{\bf
        R}' j} \rangle = ({\bf R} + {\bf t}_j) \delta_{{\bf R} {\bf R}'}
        \delta_{ij}`. However, this relation does not hold for Wannier
        functions! Therefore, if you use tight-binding model derived
        from this class in computing Berry-like objects that involve
        position operator such as Berry phase or Berry flux, you would
        not get the same result as if you computed those objects
        directly from the first-principles code! Nevertheless, this
        approximation does not affect other properties such as band
        structure dispersion.


    Examples
    --------
    Read Wannier90 from folder called *example_a*
    This assumes that that folder contains files "silicon.win" (and so on)

        This function returns :class:`pythtb.TBModel` object that can

        The tight-binding basis orbitals in the returned object are
        maximally localized Wannier functions as computed by
        Wannier90. Locations of the orbitals in the returned
        :class:`pythtb.TBModel` object are the centers of
        the Wannier functions computed by Wannier90.

        Parameters
        ----------

        zero_energy : float
            Sets the zero of the energy in the band structure.
            This value is typically set to the Fermi level
            computed by the density-functional code (or to the top of the valence band).
            Units are electron-volts.

        min_hopping_norm : float
            Hopping terms read from Wannier90 with complex norm less than
            *min_hopping_norm* will not be included in the returned
            tight-binding model. This parameters is specified in
            electron-volts. By default all terms regardless of their
            norm are included.

        max_distance : float
            Hopping terms from site *i* to site *j+R* will be ignored if
            the distance from orbital *i* to *j+R* is larger than
            *max_distance*. This parameter is given in Angstroms.
            By default all terms regardless of the distance are included.

        ignorable_imaginary_part : float
            The hopping term will be assumed to be exactly real if the
            absolute value of the imaginary part as computed by Wannier90
            is less than *ignorable_imaginary_part*. By default imaginary
            terms are not ignored. Units are again eV.

        Returns
        -------
        tb : :class:`pythtb.TBModel`
            The :class:`pythtb.TBModel` that can be used to
            interpolate Wannier90 band structure to an arbitrary k-point as well
            as to analyze the character of the wavefunctions.

        Notes
        -----
        - The character of the maximally localized Wannier functions is
          not exactly the same as that specified by the initial
          projections. The orbital character of the Wannier functions can be
          inferred either from the *projections* block in the *prefix*.win or
          from the *prefix*.nnkp file.

        - One way to ensure that the Wannier functions are as close to
          the initial projections as possible is to first choose a good set
          of initial projections (for these initial and final spread should
          not differ more than 20%) and then perform another Wannier90 run
          setting *num_iter=0* in the *prefix*.win file.

        - The tight-binding model returned by this function is only as good as
          the input from Wannier90. In particular, the choice of initial
          projections can have a significant impact on the quality of the
          resulting Wannier functions. It is recommended to experiment with
          different sets of initial projections and to carefully analyze the
          resulting Wannier functions to ensure that they are physically
          meaningful.

        - The number of spin components is always set to 1, even if the
          underlying DFT calculation includes spin.  Please refer to the
          *projections* block or the *prefix*.nnkp file to see which
          orbitals correspond to which spin.

        r"""Read interpolated band structure from Wannier90 output files.

        The purpose of this function is to compare the interpolation
        in Wannier90 with that in PythTB. This function reads in the band
        structure as interpolated by Wannier90.

        The code assumes that the following files were generated by
        Wannier90,

        - ``prefix_band.kpt``
        - ``prefix_band.dat``

        These files will be generated only if the *prefix*.win file
        contains the *kpoint_path* block.

        Parameters
        ----------
        return_k_cart : bool, optional
            If True, also return k-points in Cartesian coordinates.

            .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

        return_k_dist : bool, optional
            If True, also return the cumulative k-path distance (in inverse Angstroms).

            .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

        return_k_nodes : bool, optional
            If True, also return the k-point nodes and labels used in the path.
            Format is ``(k_nodes, k_labels)`` where ``k_nodes`` is an array
            of reduced coordinates and ``k_labels`` is a list of strings.

            .. versionadded:: 2.0.0

        Returns
        -------
        kpts : array
            k-points in reduced coordinates used in the
            interpolation in Wannier90 code. The expected format is
            the same as the input to
            :func:`pythtb.TBModel.solve_ham`.
        energy : array
            Energies interpolated by Wannier90 in eV. Format is ``energy[kpt,band]``.
        k_dist : array, optional
            Cumulative distances along the path (1/Angstrom) as reported by Wannier90.
            Returned when ``return_k_dist=True``. Useful for plotting band structures.
        k_cart : array, optional
            k-points in Cartesian coordinates (1/Angstrom).
            Returned when ``return_k_cart=True``.
        k_nodes : tuple[array, list[str]], optional
            Tuple ``(k_nodes, k_labels)`` containing the reduced coordinates
            of the k-point nodes and their labels.
            Returned when ``return_k_nodes=True``.

        Notes
        -----
        - The bands returned here are not the same as the band
          structure calculated by the underlying DFT code. The two will
          agree only on the coarse set of k-points that were used in
          Wannier90 generation.
        - If no matrix elements were ignored in the call to :func:`pythtb.w90.model`
          then the two should be exactly the same (up to numerical precision).
          Otherwise one should expect deviations.
        - If one carefully chooses the cutoff parameters in :func:`pythtb.w90.model`
          it is likely that one could reproduce the full band-structure
          with only few dominant hopping terms.

        Examples
        --------
        Get band structure from `Wannier90`

        >>> w90_kpt, w90_evals, w90_k_dist, w90_k_nodes, w90_k_labels = silicon.bands_w90(
        ... return_k_dist=True, return_k_nodes=True)

        Get simplified model

        >>> my_model_simple = silicon.model(min_hopping_norm=0.01)

        Solve simplified model on the same k-path as in `Wannier90`

        >>> evals = my_model.solve_ham(w90_kpt)

        Now plot the comparison of the two

        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        >>> for i in range(evals.shape[1]):
        >>>     ax.plot(range(evals.shape[1]), evals[i], "r-", zorder=-50)
        >>> for i in range(w90_evals.shape[0]):
        >>>     ax.plot(range(w90_evals.shape[1]), w90_evals[i], "k-", zorder=-100)
