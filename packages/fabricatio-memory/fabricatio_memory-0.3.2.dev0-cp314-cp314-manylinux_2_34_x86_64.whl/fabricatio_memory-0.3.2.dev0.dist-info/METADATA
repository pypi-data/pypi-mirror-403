## 🔍 Overview

Provides comprehensive memory management capabilities for fabricatio agents, enabling extended context handling and
intelligent information retrieval. The package combines long-term and short-term memory systems with agent integration
for enhanced decision-making and context-aware processing.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Long-Term Memory Storage**: Persistent storage of important information including user profiles, historical
  conversations, and domain knowledge for personalized responses
- **Short-Term Memory Buffer**: Maintains recent context and conversation history to ensure coherent and contextually
  appropriate responses
- **Intelligent Memory Retrieval**: Advanced search mechanisms to find relevant information based on keywords, context,
  and semantic similarity
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient memory allocation and cleanup to maintain performance while maximizing context
  retention
- **Agent Integration**: Seamless integration with fabricatio agents for memory-augmented decision making and context
  awareness
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports various storage backends and can handle large volumes of memory data
