"""Integration test for Claude Code config file parsing.

Tests verify that wildcard extraction in the projects.*.mcpServers structure:
1. Uses just the server name (no project path prefix)
2. Stores the full project path(s) in the project_name field as a list
3. Servers with same name in multiple projects are merged with all projects listed
