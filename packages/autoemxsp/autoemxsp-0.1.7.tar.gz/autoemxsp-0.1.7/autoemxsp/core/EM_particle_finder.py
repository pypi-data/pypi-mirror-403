Automated Electron Microscopy (EM) Particle Analysis Toolkit

This module provides the EM_Particle_Finder class for particle detection, selection of X-ray spectra (EDS, WDS) acquisition spots,
and particle size/statistics analysis.
It is designed to interface with an EM driver and an EM_Controller object to streamline the workflow from image acquisition to data export.

Currently only supports SEM.

Main Class
----------
EM_Particle_Finder
    Automates particle detection, mask generation, and X-ray spectra spot selection on detected particles.
    Supports both fully automated and manual (user-guided) collection modes.
    Provides methods for collecting particle statistics and managing frame navigation.

Example Usage
-------------
# EDS spot acquisition workflow:
>>> EM_controller = EM_Controller(...)
>>> EM_controller.initialise_SEM()
>>> particle_finder = EM_Particle_Finder(EM_controller, PowderMeasurementConfig, ...)
>>> while particle_finder.go_to_next_particle():
...     xy_spot_list = particle_finder.get_XS_acquisition_spots_coord_list()
...     for (x,y) in xy_spot_list:
...         EM_controller.acquire_XS_spectrum()


# Particle analysis workflow:
>>> EM_controller = EM_Controller(...)
>>> EM_controller.initialise_SEM()
>>> particle_finder = EM_Particle_Finder(EM_controller, PowderMeasurementConfig, results_dir="./results")
>>> particle_finder.get_particle_stats(n_par_target=500)

Notes
-----
- Requires an initialised EM_Controller object, unless used in development mode
- Requires a working EM_driver and appropriate hardware configuration, with the following API functions:
    Microscope Status & Image Acquisition
    -------------------------------------
    - is_at_EM
        Boolean attribute; True if running at the actual electron microscope.
    
    - get_image_data(width, height, channel)
        Acquire an image from the microscope with specified dimensions and channels.
    
    - get_frame_width()
        Get the current field of view/frame width (in mm).
    
    Stage & Navigation Control
    --------------------------
    - move_to(x, y)
        Move the microscope stage to the specified (x, y) position.

    """
    Automated particle analysis and X-ray spectra (EDS, WDS) acquisition in an electron microscope (EM).

    This class provides methods for particle detection, selection of X-ray spectra (EDS, WDS) acquisition spots,
    and particle size/statistics analysis.

    image acquisition to data export.


    Main Methods
    ------------
    initialise_SEM()
        Wakes up the SEM microscope, sets measurement parameters, and evaluates locations to scan for particles.
    go_to_next_particle()
        Locates and moves to the next detected particle.
    get_XS_acquisition_spots_coord_list()
        Determines X-ray spectra (EDS, WDS) acquisition spots on the currently detected particle.
    get_particle_stats()
        Scans the full sample, collecting particle size distribution statistics.

        ----------
        frame_image : ndarray, optional
            Grayscale image of the current frame. If not provided and running at the EM, the image is acquired.
        pixel_size : float, optional
            Pixel size in micrometers. Required if not running at the EM.
        results_dir : str, optional
            Directory to save results. Required for saving images in development mode.
    
        Returns
        -------
        bool or None
            True if at least one suitable particle was found in the frame.

            None if there are no more frames available.
        
        Notes
        -----
        - The function saves a visualization image with detected particles for development.
        - All commented-out imshow and development lines are preserved for debugging.
        - Particle positions and frame widths are stored as class attributes for later use.
        
        Potential Improvements
        ---------------------
        - Exclude particles that are close to larger particles in the direction of the EDS (Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy) detector.
          Large particles in the path can absorb or scatter X-rays emitted from smaller particles, degrading the quality and accuracy 
          of the spectral signal for those particles.
        
          Suggested implementation:
          - For each detected particle, determine if there are larger particles located "upstream" (i.e., between the particle and 
            the EDS detector direction).
          - To do this, add a control '_is_particle_shadowed()' together with '_is_particle_area_ok()' to select valid particles.

        If no particle is present at the center, the function searches for and centers on the next closest 
        sufficiently large particle. This approach makes the function robust against drift or movement of 
        the particle during analysis. If no valid particle is found, the function returns None.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        par_image : ndarray, optional
            Grayscale image of the current frame. If not provided and running at the EM, the image is acquired.
        pixel_size_um : float, optional
            Pixel size in micrometers. Required if not running at the EM.
        results_dir : str, optional
            Directory to save results. Required for saving the mask in development mode.
        centering : bool, optional
            If True, indicates this is a second attempt at centering on a particle (prevents infinite recursion).
    
        Returns
        -------
        tuple or None

            None: If no suitable particle is found.
        
        Notes
        -----
        - The function is robust to small misalignments: if the center particle is not valid, it finds the next closest.
        - In development mode, it saves the resulting mask with a scalebar overlay.
        - The commented `cv2.imshow` lines can be enabled for debugging visualization.

        '''
        Returns a list of coordinates (relative, in the current image) for X-ray spectrum spot collection on a particle.
    
        The function finds a suitable particle mask, erodes the mask to avoid particle edges, finds bright regions (or peak spots),
        and selects up to `powder_meas_cfg.max_spectra_per_par` spots per particle with a minimum distance between them (determined through 'powder_meas_cfg.par_mask_margin').
        The selection strategy for features and spacing can be controlled via powder_meas_cfg.par_feature_selection and powder_meas_cfg.par_spot_spacing.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        n_tot_sp_collected : int
            Counter for the total number of spectra collected (used for labeling).
        par_image : ndarray, optional
            Grayscale image of the current frame. If not provided and running at the SEM, the image is acquired.
        pixel_size_um : float, optional
            Pixel size in micrometers. Required if not running at the SEM.
        results_dir : str, optional
            Directory to save result images.
    
        Returns
        -------
        pts_rel_coords : ndarray
            Array of selected (x, y) spot coordinates in relative units (centered at 0).
    
            Coordinate System
            ----------------
            The coordinates are expressed in a normalized, aspect-ratio-correct system centered at the image center:
    
                - The origin (0, 0) is at the image center.
                - The x-axis is horizontal, increasing to the right, ranging from -0.5 (left) to +0.5 (right).
                - The y-axis is vertical, increasing downward, and scaled by the aspect ratio (height/width):
                    * Top edge:    y = -0.5 × (height / width)
                    * Bottom edge: y = +0.5 × (height / width)
                
                |        (-0.5, -0.5*height/width)         (0.5, -0.5*height/width)
                |                       +-------------------------+
                |                       |                         |
                |                       |                         |
                |                       |           +(0,0)        |-----> +x
                |                       |                         |
                |                       |                         |
                v  +y                   +-------------------------+
                        (-0.5,  0.5*height/width)         (0.5, 0.5*height/width)
    
            This ensures the coordinate system is always centered and aspect-ratio-correct, regardless of image size.
    
        Potential Improvements
        ---------------------
        - Select points to ensure all phases are individuated, biasing spot selection to ensure representation
            of phases with different bright/dark contrast. Currently, only the brightest spots are picked,
            which may miss some phases.
        - Add detection of both peaks and valleys to ensure both bright and dark spots are tested.
        - Exclude points that are close to larger particles along the X-ray emission path to the EDS detector,
          as these may absorb emitted X-rays and degrade spectral signal.

        This function identifies connected components (regions) in the thresholded image,

        The method of selection depends on the `feature_selection` argument:

        - For 'random', all pixels in each sufficiently large component are returned.
        - For 'peaks', local maxima are found by repeatedly masking out regions around each peak.
        - The margin for masking out peaks is determined by `self.powder_meas_cfg.par_mask_margin` and `self.EM.pixel_size_um`.
        - The maximum number of iterations for peak finding is `100 * self.powder_meas_cfg.max_spectra_per_par`.
        - Only components with area >= `min_area_pixels` are considered.

                - 'measurement' : str
                    Description of the measurement (e.g., 'equivalent particle diameter in μm').
                - 'n_par_analysed' : int
                    Number of particles analyzed.
                - 'mean' : float
                    Mean equivalent particle diameter (μm).
                - 'stdev' : float
                    Standard deviation of the equivalent particle diameter (μm).
                - 'median' : float
                    Median equivalent particle diameter (μm).
                - 'max' : float
                    Maximum equivalent particle diameter (μm).
                - 'min' : float
                    Minimum equivalent particle diameter (μm).
                - 'D10' : float
                    10th percentile of the equivalent particle diameter (μm).
                - 'D25' : float
                    25th percentile of the equivalent particle diameter (μm).
                - 'D75' : float
                    75th percentile of the equivalent particle diameter (μm).
                - 'D90' : float
                    90th percentile of the equivalent particle diameter (μm).
    
            This DataFrame is also saved as a CSV file in the results directory.
    
        Side Effects
        ------------
        - Updates `self.analyzed_pars` with new particle areas (in μm²), and corresponding frame_label.
        - Saves a CSV file with all particle areas and equivalent diameters.
        - Saves a CSV file with summary statistics (mean, stdev, median, percentiles).
        - Saves a histogram plot of the equivalent diameters as a PNG file.
        - Prints information and warnings to the console if `self.verbose` is True.
    
        Notes
        -----
        - The function relies on `_move_and_get_particles_stats_in_frame()` to process each frame and find new particles.
        - If no particles are found or frames are exhausted, the function will print a warning and exit early.
        - Equivalent diameters are computed assuming each particle is a circle of the same area.
        - The function sorts particle areas to facilitate percentile calculations.
        - The function handles cases where particles are very small or indistinguishable in area.
    
        Potential Improvements / TODO
        ----------------------------
        - Ideally the software should autonomously measure different particle sizes at different frame widths.
            At the moment, it requires a specific range to be selected, and filters out particles outside this range.
        - Particles at frame edges are currently ignored. Ideally, they should be included by centering the stage around them, and
            recording their area
        - Add robust error handling for file I/O and plotting.
        - Optionally return summary statistics as a dictionary or DataFrame for further programmatic use.

        - Particles are filtered by area and by proximity to the frame edge.
        - The area of each accepted particle is appended to `self.analyzed_pars`.
        - An annotated image with detected particles and their indices is saved for visualization.
        - If no valid particles are found, the mask image is deleted and the function returns False.
        - If at least one particle is found, the microscope focus/contrast/brightness is refreshed if needed.
