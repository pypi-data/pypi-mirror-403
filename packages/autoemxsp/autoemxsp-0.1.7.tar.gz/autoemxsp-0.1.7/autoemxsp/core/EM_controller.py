Automated Electron Microscopy (EM) Controller and Sample Image Analyzer

This module provides classes and functions for automated analysis and acquisition in scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
including particle detection, stage navigation, X-ray spectra (EDS, WDS) acquisition, and sample management.
It is designed to interface with an EM driver and streamline the workflow from image acquisition to data export.

Main Classes
------------
EM_Controller
    Automates particle detection, mask generation, and X-ray spectra acquisition on detected particles.
    Supports both fully automated and manual (user-guided) collection modes.
    Provides methods for collecting particle statistics and managing frame navigation.

EM_Sample_Finder
    Provides utilities for locating and managing samples within the EM.
    Currently includes only the detection of the center of a Carbon tape.

Example Usage
-------------
# EDS spot acquisition workflow:
>>> particle_finder = EM_Particle_Finder(...)
>>> particle_finder.initialise_SEM()
>>> while True:
...     particle_finder.go_to_next_particle()
...     xy_spot_list = particle_finder.get_XS_acquisition_spots_coord_list()
...     # Collect X-ray spectra at each (x, y) as needed


# Particle analysis workflow:
>>> from em_analysis import EM_Particle_Finder, EM_Sample_Finder
>>> microscope_cfg = {...}
>>> measurement_cfg = {...}
>>> holder_cfg = {...}
>>> particle_finder = EM_Particle_Finder(
...     sample_ID="Sample1",
...     microscope_d=microscope_cfg,
...     measurement_d=measurement_cfg,
...     sample_holder_d=holder_cfg,
...     results_dir="./results"
... )
>>> particle_finder.initialise_SEM()
>>> particle_finder.get_particle_stats(n_par_target=500)

# C tape detection workflow:
>>> from em_analysis import EM_Sample_Finder
>>> finder = EM_Sample_Finder('MySEM', (0, 0), 3, 12, './results', verbose=True)
>>> Ctape_coords = finder.detect_Ctape()
>>> if Ctape_coords:
...     print("Center (mm):", Ctape_coords[0], "Half-width (mm):", Ctape_coords[1])

    Electron Microscope (EM) controller for automated particle analysis and X-ray spectra (EDS, WDS) acquisition.

    This class provides methods for automated image acquisition, stage navigation, and X-ray spectral acquisition.

    Configuration is provided via structured dataclasses:
        - MicroscopeConfig
        - SampleConfig
        - MeasurementConfig
        - SampleSubstrateConfig

    Main Methods
    ------------
    initialise_SEM()
        Wakes up the SEM microscope, sets measurement parameters, and evaluates locations to scan for particles.
    initialise_XS_analyzer()
        Gets EDS/WDS analyzer object from EM_driver, and optionally updates electron beam energy.
        Currently only EDS is supported.
    acquire_XS_spot_spectrum(x,y) 
        Acquire and return X-Ray spectral data in position (x,y) in current stage position.
        (x,y) are relative coordinates. See function description for more information.

            - If encountering multiple contamination particles, repeat this.

        Generates and labels a set of evenly spaced scanning locations (frames) within a sample area,
        either circular or rectangular. Optionally avoids the rough sample border (margin), and can 
        randomize the order of the frames to reduce spatial bias.
    
        In general, this function determines where the microscope should position itself to systematically 
        analyze a sample. It calculates a grid of (x, y) positions ("frame centers") covering either a 
        circular or rectangular region, depending on the sample_substrate_cfg.shape ensuring each position is
        within a safe distance from the edge if requested. Each frame center is given a unique label
        (like "A3" or "B7") for identification. The resulting positions and labels are stored for later navigation.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        horizontal_spacing_mm: float
            Horizontal spacing between neighboring grid spots in mm
        im_h_to_w_ratio: float,
            ratio height/width of frame dimensions
        center_pos: tuple(float, float)
            (x,y) coordinates of sample center, in stage coordinates
        randomize_frames : bool
            If True, shuffle the order of frame centers to avoid spatial bias.
        exclude_sample_margin : bool
            If True, apply a margin to avoid the rough border of the C tape (for EDX).
            If False, allow frames up to the tape edge (for size measurements).
        shape : str, optional
            'circle' to scan within a circular region (default), or 'rectangle' for a rectangular region.
    
        Sets
        ----
        self.frame_pos_mm : list of tuple
            List of (x, y) positions (in mm) corresponding to the center of each frame.
        self.frame_labels : list of str
            List of corresponding frame labels (e.g., 'A0', 'B3', ...).
        self.num_frames : int
            Number of analyzable frames.
            
        Notes
        -----
        Frame labelling follows a grid system:
        
            - Columns are labelled with letters (A, B, C, ...), rows with numbers (0, 1, 2, ...).
            - Each frame center is assigned a label such as 'A0', 'B3', etc.
            - For a circular sample, only frames within the circle are included.
        
        Example grid:
        
              y
              ^

                - The origin (0, 0) is at the image center.
                - The x-axis is horizontal, increasing to the right, ranging from -0.5 (left) to +0.5 (right).
                - The y-axis is vertical, increasing downward, and scaled by the aspect ratio (height/width):
                    * Top edge:    y = -0.5 × (height / width)
                    * Bottom edge: y = +0.5 × (height / width)
                
                |        (-0.5, -0.5*height/width)         (0.5, -0.5*height/width)

                |                       |                         |

#%% Electron Microscope Sample Finder class    
class EM_Sample_Finder:
    """
    Class for locating and managing samples in an electron microscope (EM).

    This class provides methods for detecting sample features (such as the center and size of a C tape)
    using the microscope's navigation camera.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    microscope_ID : str
        Identifier for the target microscope.
    center_pos : np.ndarray
        Initial center position of sample as a NumPy array of shape (2,), representing [x, y] coordinates.
    results_dir : Optional[str]
        Directory path to save results, or None if not set.
    verbose : bool
        If True, enables detailed debug output.
    development_mode (bool): Whether class is being used for testing image processing functions, without real-time acquisition.
        Enables use of class outside microscope enviroment
    
    Example
    -------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> sample_center = np.array([0.0, 0.0])  # stage coordinates in mm
    >>> finder = EM_Sample_Finder(
    ...     microscope_ID='MySEM',
    ...     center_pos=sample_center,
    ...     sample_half_width_mm: 3,
    ...     substrate_width_mm: 12,
    ...     results_dir='./results',
    ...     verbose=True
    ... )
    >>> ctape_result = finder.detect_Ctape()
    Detecting position of C tape
    C tape detected.
    >>> if ctape_result is not None:
    ...     center_pos, sample_hw_mm = ctape_result
    ...     print("C tape center (mm):", center_pos)
    ...     print("C tape half-width (mm):", sample_hw_mm)
    ... else:
    ...     print("C tape detection failed.")
     
    Notes
    -----
    - The navigation camera image can be provided directly (for offline testing) or acquired live from the microscope.
    - For successful detection, the microscope calibration file must include the attributes:
      'navcam_im_w_mm', 'navcam_x_offset', 'navcam_y_offset'.
    - The detected center and half-width (radius) can be used to configure automated acquisition grids or for quality control.
