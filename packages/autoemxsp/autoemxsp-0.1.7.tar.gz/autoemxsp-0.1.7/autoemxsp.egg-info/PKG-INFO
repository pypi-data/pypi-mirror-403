**Automated Electron Microscopy X-Ray Spectroscopy for Compositional Characterization of Materials**

</div>

AutoEMXSp is a **fully automated framework** for SEM-EDS workflows — from spectral acquisition and quantification, to principled filtering and compositional analysis — all in **one click**.

🎥 Watch AutoEMXSp in action on a desktop SEM-EDS system at https://youtu.be/Bym58gNxlj0

🧪 Test AutoEMXSp to fit and quantify EDS spectra you have collected on your commercial SEM-EDS system (see [Tutorials](https://cedergrouphub.github.io/AutoEMXSp/user/tutorials.html)).

📖 This work is described in:  
A. Giunto *et al.*, *Accurate SEM‑EDS Quantification, Automation, and Machine Learning Enable High‑Throughput Compositional Characterization of Powders*, 2025.  
DOI: [https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7837297/v2](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-7837297/v2)

### ✨ Key Features
- **Fully automated SEM-EDS phase-level compositional analysis workflow**, which includes:
    - **Acquisition of EDS spectra**, including particle localization if sample is powder. Compatible also with bulk samples, or manual navigation. 
    - **Quantification of compositions** using the peak-to-background method
    - **Rule-based filtering** of compositions to discard poorly quantified spectra from the analysis
    - **Unsupervised machine learning–based analysis** to identify the compositions of individual phases in the sample  

- Scripts for **fitting and quantification** of single EDS spectra exported by proprietary commercial software (.msa, .emsa, .txt files)

- **Automated experimental standard collection** scripts

- **Automated particle size distribution measurements** scripts

- **Extensible architecture** — adaptable to other techniques such as  
  - Wavelength Dispersive Spectroscopy (WDS)  
  - Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) with EDS  

- **Extensible hardware support** — includes driver for ThermoFisher Phenom Desktop SEM series, and can be extended to any electron microscope with a Python API  

### 📊 Performance
- **Benchmarked** on 74 single-phase samples with compositions spanning **38 elements** (from nitrogen to bismuth), it achieved **<5–10% relative deviation** from expected values  
- **Machine learning** compositional analysis detects individual phase composition in **multi-phase samples**, including minor phases
- **Intermixed phases** can also be resolved

### 🧪 Supported Use Cases
- Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) with Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS)  
- Powders and rough samples, e.g. rough films, or pellets, with automated segmentation.
- Bulk, flat samples, navigated by defining a grid of points to probe.
- Manual navigation of any sample.

### ⚙️ Requirements
- Cross-platform: runs on **Linux, macOS, and Windows**
- Quick installation  
- Requires calibration for use with different electron microscopes for maximum compositional accuracy, though EDS quantification can be tested without recalibration.

## 📘 Documentation

Installation instructions, usage examples, and workflow descriptions are available in the AutoEMXSp documentation:

👉 https://cedergrouphub.github.io/AutoEMXSp/


---

## 📦 Requirements

- **Python 3.11 or newer**  
- All dependencies are installed automatically via `pip` or `conda`.  
- Tested versions of dependencies are specified in `pyproject.toml`.  
  > The package **may work** with more recent versions, but these have **not been tested**.

## 📁 Scripts

This repository includes a collection of scripts that streamline the use of **AutoEMXSp**.  
Each script is tailored for a specific task in spectral acquisition, calibration, quantification, or analysis.

### 🔬 Acquisition, Quantification & Analysis
- **Run_Acquisition_Quant_Analysis.py** — Acquire X-ray spectra and optionally perform quantification and composition analysis.  
- **Run_Quantification_Analysis.py** — Quantify acquired spectra (single or multiple samples) and perform machine-learning analysis.  
- **Run_Analysis.py** — Launch customized machine-learning analysis on previously quantified data. 
- **Fit_Quant_Single_AutoEMXSp_Spectrum.py** — Fit and optionally quantify a single spectrum measured with AutoEMXSp. Prints fitting parameters and plots fitted spectrum for detailed inspection of model performance.  
- **Fit_Quant_Single_MSA_Spectrum.py** — Fit and optionally quantify a single spectrum exported by proprietary software. 

### 📊 Particle Size Distribution Measurements
- **Collect_Particle_Statistics.py** - Analyse sample, collecting particle size statistics and distribution.

Use the same scripts as regular composition characterization, as described in the docs Tutorial.

👉 All scripts can be executed directly from the command line or imported into a Python environment, making them accessible from anywhere on your system.
