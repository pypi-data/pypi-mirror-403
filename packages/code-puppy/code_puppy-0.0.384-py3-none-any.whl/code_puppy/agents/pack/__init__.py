"""The Pack - Specialized sub-agents coordinated by Pack Leader 🐺

This package contains the specialized agents that work together under
Pack Leader's coordination for parallel multi-agent workflows:

- **Bloodhound** 🐕‍🦺 - Issue tracking specialist (bd only)
- **Terrier** 🐕 - Worktree management (git worktree from base branch)
- **Husky** 🐺 - Task execution (coding work in worktrees)
- **Shepherd** 🐕 - Code review critic (quality gatekeeper)
- **Watchdog** 🐕‍🦺 - QA critic (tests, coverage, quality)
- **Retriever** 🦮 - Local branch merging (git merge to base branch)

All work happens locally - no GitHub PRs or remote pushes.
Everything merges to a declared base branch.

Each agent is designed to do one thing well, following the Unix philosophy.
Pack Leader orchestrates them to execute complex parallel workflows.
