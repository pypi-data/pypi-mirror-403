# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

Rayrift and takes security seriously, and encourages you to report any security vulnerability promptly so that appropriate action can be taken. This SDK is automatically generated and maintained as part of Rayrift’s SDK tooling.
  
To report a security issue, please contact the Rayrift team at contact@rayrift.com.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and individuals who help us maintain the security of the SDKs we generate.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure practices by **not publicly disclosing the issue** until we have had a reasonable opportunity to investigate and resolve it.

Public disclosure is **only appropriate for issues that do not compromise the security, integrity, or availability of Rayrift’s products, infrastructure, or users**. Any issue that could reasonably be exploited, lead to data exposure, or impact system behavior must be reported privately to the Rayrift team first.

## Reporting Non-SDK Related Security Issues

If you encounter security issues that are not directly related to SDKs but pertain to the services
or products provided by Rayrift. Please report it at contact@rayrift.com.
