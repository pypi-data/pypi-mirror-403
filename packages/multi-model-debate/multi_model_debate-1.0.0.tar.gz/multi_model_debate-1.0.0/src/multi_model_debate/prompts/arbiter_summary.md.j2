You are generating a summary report for a non-technical human arbiter who will make final decisions on this proposal. They defer to technical consensus but decide on tradeoffs, priorities, and constraints.

Generate a comprehensive summary with these sections:

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
3-5 sentences: What was reviewed, who won, overall verdict (APPROVED / CONDITIONAL / BLOCKED).

## 2. ISSUES BY CATEGORY

### TECHNICAL FACTS (Defer to consensus)
Issues where models agree on objective technical reality.
| Issue | Severity | Consensus | Status |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|

### TRADEOFFS (Human decision required)
Issues where both positions have merit - arbiter chooses based on values.
| Tradeoff | Option A | Option B | Models Preferred |
|----------|----------|----------|------------------|

### CONSTRAINTS (Human decision required)
Issues that question stated constraints (budget, tech stack, timeline).
| Constraint Challenged | Critique | Your Call |
|-----------------------|----------|-----------|

## 3. WHAT WAS RESOLVED

- **Defended successfully:** Strategist convinced the critic
- **Conceded:** Strategist agreed with critique
- **Technical consensus:** All models agree on fix

## 4. WHAT NEEDS YOUR DECISION

| # | Decision Needed | Context | Options |
|---|-----------------|---------|---------|

## 5. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

| Priority | Action | Why | Effort |
|----------|--------|-----|--------|
| BLOCKER | ... | ... | S/M/L |
| HIGH | ... | ... | S/M/L |
| MEDIUM | ... | ... | S/M/L |

## 6. MINORITY DISSENT

Valid points from the losing side worth reconsidering:
| Point | Raised By | Why Rejected | Reconsider? |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------|

## 7. PROPOSAL CROSS-REFERENCE

| Proposal Section | Issues Found | Severity |
|------------------|--------------|----------|

## 8. MY RECOMMENDATION

As the Strategist (the proposal defender), provide your honest assessment:
- What do YOU think the arbiter should decide on each tradeoff and why?
- Are there any issues you conceded that you think are lower priority than the critic claimed?
- Are there any defended points you're less confident about in hindsight?
- What's the single most important thing to get right before implementation?

Be direct and share your reasoning. The arbiter is a non-technical business user who relies on your guidance to understand the technical implications.

## 9. ISSUE RESPONSE CHECKLIST

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST include this checklist showing how EVERY issue from the debate was addressed. Use this exact format:

| Issue ID | Title | Response | Status |
|----------|-------|----------|--------|

For each issue raised during the debate (from baseline critiques through the defense rounds), add a row with:
- **Issue ID**: The original issue ID (e.g., ISSUE-001)
- **Title**: Brief issue title
- **Response**: 1-2 sentence summary of how you addressed it
- **Status**: One of:
  - `ADDRESSED` - Issue was fixed or successfully defended with rationale
  - `REJECTED` - Issue was rejected with explanation (not a valid concern)
  - `DEFERRED` - Issue acknowledged but deferred to future version
  - `NOT_APPLICABLE` - Issue no longer relevant (e.g., feature removed)

Example:
| ISSUE-001 | Role assignment bias | Defended: Judge evaluates critics, not plan | ADDRESSED |
| ISSUE-002 | Env-var detection | Conceded: Will document | ADDRESSED |
| ISSUE-003 | Research step undefined | N/A: Already removed in v4 | NOT_APPLICABLE |

This checklist ensures all critiques were considered and nothing was overlooked.

## WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?

End with this exact question to the arbiter:

"Based on this review, would you like me to:
1. **Generate an execution prompt for CC2** to implement all consensus fixes (I'll include the decisions you make on tradeoffs)
2. **Discuss specific issues further** before proceeding
3. **Revise the game plan** to incorporate changes before implementation

What's your preference?"
