# How I Built This Without Being a Developer

I'm not a developer. I'm a business user who got fascinated by what AI can do.

## The Problem

In early 2025, I was working through the Power Up program using ChatGPT to help clarify vague instructions. It worked until it didn't. ChatGPT would confidently give me wrong answers, and I'd waste hours before realizing I'd been led down a dead end. So I started cross-checking with Claude and Gemini. When one model got stuck, another would catch the mistake.

That got me thinking: what if models could debate each other automatically?

## The Search

I searched for existing tools. ChatGPT told me my idea was brilliant and original. It wasn't. I later learned about CrewAI, AutoGen, and other multi-agent frameworks. But those tools required API keys, and I wanted to use my existing subscriptions. So I decided to build it anyway.

## The Build

It went badly for months. I'd work with ChatGPT and Claude Code, hit walls, get frustrated, and walk away. Eventually I came back, and with Claude Code's help, got it working.

Halfway through, I learned about proxies that could bypass the API key requirement. By then I was too close to finishing to switch approaches.

## What I Learned

- AI can build production-quality code if you can clearly articulate what you need
- The skill isn't coding. It's requirements, persistence, and knowing when something is actually done
- My "AI vocabulary" grew the more I used it. Better questions led to better results
- Tools I thought were unique already existed. I just couldn't find them until I learned the right search terms

## What I Still Don't Understand

- Why the code is structured the way it is
- Performance implications and edge cases
- Whether there are lurking bugs I'd never catch

## Why I'm Sharing This

Three years ago, I couldn't have built this without extensive training. Now I can. That shift matters.

I'm not posting this as "look at my technical skills." I'm posting it because non-developers can now build working software by effectively directing AI. If that sounds useful to you, here's proof it works.
