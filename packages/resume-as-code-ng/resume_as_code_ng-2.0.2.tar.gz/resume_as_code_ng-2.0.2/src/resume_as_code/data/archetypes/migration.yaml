# System Migration Work Unit Template
# ====================================
# Use this archetype for: platform migrations, cloud migrations, database migrations,
# technology upgrades, legacy system replacements
#
# PAR Framework Focus:
# - Problem: What system needed migration and why?
# - Action: How did you plan and execute the migration?
# - Result: What was the outcome and business benefit?

schema_version: "4.0.0"
archetype: migration

# ID Format: wu-YYYY-MM-DD-slug
id: "wu-YYYY-MM-DD-migration-slug"

# Title: Emphasize what was migrated and the benefit
# Examples:
# - "Migrated 500TB data warehouse to cloud with zero downtime"
# - "Led database migration reducing latency by 60%"
title: "Migrated [SYSTEM/DATA] achieving [KEY BENEFIT]"

# Problem Section - Why migration was needed
problem:
  # Statement: What drove the migration need?
  statement: |
    [SYSTEM] required migration due to [DRIVER: end-of-life, scaling limits, cost, etc.].
    Current state: [SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS].

  # Constraints: Migration-specific challenges
  constraints:
    - "Downtime tolerance: [Zero/minimal/scheduled maintenance window]"
    - "Data integrity: [Must maintain 100% data accuracy]"
    - "Timeline: [Hard deadline due to license expiry, etc.]"
    - "Rollback requirements: [Ability to revert if issues]"

  # Context: Business driver for migration
  context: |
    [Business context: cost savings, scalability needs, compliance requirements]

# Actions: Migration execution
# Strong verbs: migrated, orchestrated, validated, coordinated, executed
actions:
  - "Assessed [CURRENT STATE]: [Discovery and inventory of what needed migration]"
  - "Designed [MIGRATION PLAN]: [Approach, phases, rollback strategy]"
  - "Built [TOOLING]: [Automation, validation, monitoring tools]"
  - "Executed [MIGRATION]: [Actual migration execution approach]"
  - "Validated [RESULTS]: [How you verified successful migration]"

# Outcome Section - Migration results
outcome:
  # Result: Quantify migration success
  result: |
    Successfully migrated [SCOPE] achieving [PRIMARY METRIC].

  # Quantified Impact: Measurable improvements
  quantified_impact: "[X% cost reduction / Y% performance improvement / Z downtime hours]"

  # Business Value: Long-term benefits
  business_value: |
    [New capabilities enabled, future scalability, cost structure improvements]
