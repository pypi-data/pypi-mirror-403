{# CTO Results-Only Template - Shows only outcome results, not action bullets
   Story: 7.18-score-actions-against-jd (related)
   Purpose: For executive resumes where actions are implementation details
   that dilute the high-level impact narrative. Shows only the result/outcome
   from each work unit, keeping content density appropriate for 2-page CTO resumes.

   Research Note: Executive resumes should emphasize results/achievements over
   implementation details. Action bullets ("Built X", "Implemented Y") are
   appropriate for IC roles but can make executive resumes too long and
   detail-focused.
