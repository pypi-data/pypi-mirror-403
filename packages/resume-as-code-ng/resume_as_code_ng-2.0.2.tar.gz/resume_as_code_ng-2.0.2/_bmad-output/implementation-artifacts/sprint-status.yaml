# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog -> in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress -> done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

# RESEARCH / TECH DEBT BACKLOG:
# =============================
# Items identified during code review that warrant future investigation.
#
# [2026-01-16] Abbreviation/Expansion System (from 7-10 code review)
#   Current: Static TECH_EXPANSIONS dict in tokenizer.py with ~50 hardcoded mappings
#   Problem: Difficult to maintain, may miss domain-specific terms, no bidirectional lookup
#   Research areas:
#   - External abbreviation databases (e.g., acronym APIs, technical glossaries)
#   - ML-based abbreviation detection/expansion
#   - User-configurable abbreviation files (YAML/JSON in config)
#   - Bidirectional expansion (both "ML" -> "machine learning" AND "machine learning" -> "ML")
#   - Context-aware disambiguation (PM = project management vs product management)
#   Related: src/resume_as_code/utils/tokenizer.py TECH_EXPANSIONS dict
#
# [2026-01-17] Certification Curation by JD Relevance
#   Current: All certifications displayed regardless of job description
#   Problem: For roles where some certs are less relevant, showing all may dilute impact
#   Consideration: Lower priority than publications (11 certs vs 45 pubs, no page bloat)
#   Implementation ideas:
#   - Score certifications against JD keywords (OSCP for pentesting, CISSP for leadership)
#   - Config option: certifications.max_count (0 = unlimited, default)
#   - Config option: certifications.sort_by (relevance or date)
#   - Show most relevant N certs when JD provided
#   - Fallback to all certs when no JD
#   Related: Story 8.2 (publication curation) uses same pattern
#   Trigger: Consider when user has 15+ certifications or requests filtering
#
# [2026-01-20] Manifest-Based Resume Rebuild (TD-009)
#   Current: BuildManifest stores minimal metadata (work unit IDs, JD hash, template, ranker version)
#   Problem: Cannot rebuild identical resume from manifest alone - missing all actual content
#   Use case: Reproducibility, auditing, regenerating with same selections but different template
#   Missing data for rebuild:
#   - Full work unit content (only stores id/title/score)
#   - JD content (only stores hash, not text)
#   - Profile data (contact info, summary)
#   - Certifications and curated selections
#   - Education entries
#   - Career highlights and curated selections
#   - Publications and curated selections
#   - Board roles
#   - Position data (employers, titles, dates, scope)
#   - Skill curation results
#   - Employment continuity mode/decisions
#   Implementation ideas:
#   - Option A: Embed all content in manifest (self-contained but large)
#   - Option B: Store content hashes + require original files present
#   - Option C: Hybrid - embed curated/selected content, hash for source files
#   - New command: `resume rebuild --from-manifest <path>` to regenerate resume
#   - Version manifest format for forward compatibility
#   Related: src/resume_as_code/models/manifest.py, src/resume_as_code/providers/manifest.py
#   Priority: P3 (nice-to-have for audit trails and reproducibility)
#
# [2026-01-20] Full Resume Generation Without JD (TD-010)
#   Current: `resume build` requires --jd flag for job description to tailor content
#   Problem: Cannot generate comprehensive resume with ALL work units, certs, publications, etc.
#   Use cases:
#   - Master resume for personal records
#   - Networking events where role is unknown
#   - LinkedIn profile sync (show everything)
#   - Starting point before tailoring
#   - Portfolio/archive purposes
#   Implementation ideas:
#   - New flag: `resume build --full` or `resume build --no-jd`
#   - Skip ranking/scoring when no JD provided
#   - Include all work units (optionally sorted by date or archetype)
#   - Include all certifications, publications, education, board roles
#   - Include all career highlights
#   - Optional: `--max-pages N` to limit output length
#   - Optional: `--max-work-units N` to cap work unit count
#   - Config option: `full_resume.sort_by: date|archetype|position`
#   - Config option: `full_resume.max_work_units: 20`
#   Considerations:
#   - May produce very long resumes (5+ pages for senior professionals)
#   - Should warn user about length implications
#   - Employment continuity still applies (all positions shown)
#   Related: src/resume_as_code/commands/build.py, src/resume_as_code/commands/plan.py
#   Priority: P2 (common user request, straightforward implementation)
