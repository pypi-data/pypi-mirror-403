# Performance/Cost Optimization Work Unit Template
# =================================================
# Use this archetype for: performance tuning, cost reduction, efficiency improvements,
# resource optimization, latency reduction
#
# PAR Framework Focus:
# - Problem: What was underperforming or costing too much?
# - Action: How did you analyze and optimize?
# - Result: What improvement was achieved?

schema_version: "1.0.0"

# ID Format: wu-YYYY-MM-DD-slug
id: "wu-YYYY-MM-DD-optimization-slug"

# Title: Lead with what was optimized and the improvement
# Examples:
# - "Optimized API latency reducing p99 from 500ms to 50ms"
# - "Reduced cloud costs by 40% through resource rightsizing"
title: "Optimized [SYSTEM/METRIC] achieving [QUANTIFIED IMPROVEMENT]"

# Problem Section - What needed optimization?
problem:
  # Statement: What was the performance or cost problem?
  statement: |
    [SYSTEM] exhibited [PROBLEM: slow performance, high cost, resource waste].
    Current state: [SPECIFIC METRIC] was [VALUE], impacting [USERS/BUSINESS].

  # Constraints: What made optimization challenging?
  constraints:
    - "Production system: [Can't take offline for testing]"
    - "Limited visibility: [Incomplete metrics or monitoring]"
    - "Dependencies: [Other systems rely on this]"

  # Context: Why optimization was prioritized
  context: |
    [Business impact: user experience, costs, SLA compliance]

# Actions: Optimization approach
# Strong verbs: analyzed, profiled, optimized, eliminated, streamlined
actions:
  - "Profiled [SYSTEM]: [How you identified bottlenecks or waste]"
  - "Analyzed [ROOT CAUSES]: [What was causing the problem]"
  - "Implemented [OPTIMIZATIONS]: [Specific changes made]"
  - "Validated [IMPROVEMENTS]: [How you measured success]"
  - "Documented [FINDINGS]: [Knowledge captured for future]"

# Outcome Section - Optimization results
outcome:
  # Result: Quantify the improvement
  result: |
    Achieved [QUANTIFIED IMPROVEMENT] in [METRIC].

  # Quantified Impact: Before/after comparison
  quantified_impact: "[X% improvement / $Y cost savings / Z latency reduction]"

  # Business Value: Impact on users or business
  business_value: |
    [User experience improvement, cost savings realized, capacity unlocked]
