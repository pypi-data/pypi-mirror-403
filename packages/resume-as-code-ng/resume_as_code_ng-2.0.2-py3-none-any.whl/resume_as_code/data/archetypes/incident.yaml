# Incident Response Work Unit Template
# =====================================
# Use this archetype for: production incidents, outages, security events, escalations
#
# PAR Framework Focus:
# - Problem: What was the incident? What was the impact?
# - Action: How did you detect, respond, and resolve?
# - Result: What was the outcome? What prevention measures were implemented?

schema_version: "4.0.0"
archetype: incident

# ID Format: wu-YYYY-MM-DD-slug (replace with actual date and description)
id: "wu-YYYY-MM-DD-incident-slug"

# Title: Lead with strong action verb and quantify impact
# Examples:
# - "Resolved P1 database incident affecting 10K users"
# - "Contained security breach in payment processing system"
title: "Resolved [SEVERITY] [SYSTEM] incident affecting [SCOPE]"

# Problem Section - What challenge or incident occurred?
problem:
  # Statement: Describe the incident clearly with specific impact
  # Example: "Production database cluster failed causing 2-hour outage for all EU customers"
  statement: |
    [SYSTEM/SERVICE] experienced [ISSUE TYPE] causing [IMPACT].
    Detected at [TIME] with initial symptoms of [SYMPTOMS].

  # Constraints: What made this challenging?
  constraints:
    - "Time pressure: [X hours/minutes] to resolve"
    - "Limited visibility: [What was unclear initially]"
    - "Scope uncertainty: [Unknown blast radius at detection]"

  # Context: Why did this matter? Business context?
  # Example: "Peak shopping season with 3x normal traffic"
  context: |
    [Business context explaining why this incident mattered]

# Actions: What did YOU specifically do? Use strong action verbs.
# Strong verbs: orchestrated, spearheaded, mobilized, executed, diagnosed
actions:
  - "Detected [HOW]: [Detection method and initial signal]"
  - "Triaged [WHAT]: [How you assessed severity and impact]"
  - "Mitigated [HOW]: [Immediate actions to reduce impact]"
  - "Resolved [HOW]: [Root cause fix or workaround]"
  - "Communicated [TO WHOM]: [Stakeholder updates provided]"

# Outcome Section - What was achieved?
outcome:
  # Result: Quantify the resolution
  # Example: "Restored service in 45 minutes, preventing estimated $200K in lost revenue"
  result: |
    [QUANTIFIED RESOLUTION]: Restored service in [TIME],
    preventing [QUANTIFIED AVOIDED IMPACT].

  # Quantified Impact: Measurable improvement
  quantified_impact: "[X% reduction in MTTR / prevented $Y impact / Z users affected]"

  # Business Value: Strategic value to the organization
  business_value: |
    [What did this mean for the business? SLA impact? Customer trust?]

# Time Tracking (optional but valuable)
time_started: "YYYY-MM-DD"  # When incident began
time_ended: "YYYY-MM-DD"    # When fully resolved

# Skills Demonstrated: What capabilities did you show?
skills_demonstrated:
  - name: "Incident Command"
    # onet_element_id: "2.B.1.a"  # Optional O*NET mapping
  - name: "Root Cause Analysis"
  - name: "[Relevant Technology]"

# Confidence: How certain are you about these details?
# Values: high | medium | low
confidence: high

# Tags: Keywords for categorization and search
tags:
  - incident-response
  - "[system-name]"
  - "[technology]"

# Evidence: Links to supporting documentation (optional but valuable)
evidence:
  - type: metrics
    url: "https://[monitoring-dashboard-url]"
    dashboard_name: "Incident Timeline"
