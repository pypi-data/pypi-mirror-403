# ICESEE

**ICESEE** (ICE ShEet state and parameter Estimator) is a data assimilation software framework designed for coupling with ice sheet models such as **ISSM**, **Icepack**, and idealized models like **Lorenz-96**. It provides a modular, extensible platform for applying ensemble-based data assimilation techniques in glaciological modeling and beyond.

##  What is ICESEE?

ICESEE simplifies the implementation of advanced data assimilation workflows—such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and its variants—across a range of geophysical models. It is designed with:

- A modular Python interface  
- Seamless integration with external model codes (MATLAB, Firedrake, ISSM, etc.)  
- Support for high-performance computing and containerized workflows  
- Scalability for future integration with cloud platforms like AWS and portals like GHUB
