## How to Use These Diagrams

### Viewing Diagrams

**Option 1: Mermaid Live Editor**

1. Visit [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live)
1. Copy the contents of any `.mmd` file
1. Paste into the editor to see the rendered diagram

**Option 2: VS Code Extension**

1. Install the "Mermaid Preview" extension
1. Open any `.mmd` file
1. Right-click → "Mermaid: Open Preview"

**Option 3: Command Line Generation**

```bash
# Using mcp-cli (if available)
mcp mermaid generate docs/diagrams/base-client-architecture.mmd

# Or using the mermaid CLI
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
mmdc -i docs/diagrams/base-client-architecture.mmd -o docs/diagrams/base-client-architecture.svg
```

**Option 4: Direct Integration**
Many documentation tools support Mermaid natively:

- GitHub/GitLab markdown renders mermaid code blocks
- MkDocs with mermaid2 plugin
- Docusaurus
- Hugo with mermaid shortcode

### Adding to Documentation

To include these diagrams in your markdown files, use:

````markdown
## Architecture

### BaseAPIClient Architecture

```mermaid
path/to/diagram/file.mmd
````

Or inline the mermaid code directly:

```mermaid
graph TB
    ...
```

```

### Modifying Diagrams

All diagrams are stored as `.mmd` (Mermaid source) files, making them:
- **Editable**: Easy to modify with any text editor
- **Version-controllable**: Git can track changes
- **Regeneratable**: Can be re-rendered at any time
- **Searchable**: Text is searchable unlike images

To modify a diagram:
1. Edit the `.mmd` file
2. Preview using one of the methods above
3. Commit changes to Git

### Diagram Conventions

All diagrams follow these conventions:
- **Color coding**: Consistent color scheme across diagrams
  - Blue (#4A90E2): Core components
  - Red (#E74C3C): Error states/critical components
  - Green (#2ECC71): Success states/healthy components
  - Orange (#F39C12): Warnings/monitoring
  - Purple (#9B59B6): Authentication/security
  - Dark Gray (#34495E): External systems
- **Naming**: Descriptive file names using kebab-case
- **Documentation**: Each file has clear purpose statement
- **References**: Files document where they should be referenced

## Contributing New Diagrams

When adding new diagrams:
1. Create as `.mmd` files (not SVG images)
2. Follow the naming convention: `descriptive-name.mmd`
3. Add a reference in this index with:
   - File name
   - Location in documentation
   - Purpose
   - Type
4. Update this README with the new diagram
5. Keep diagrams simple and focused (one concept per diagram)
