## Key features

- **Deploy Kafka apps to Kubernetes**: KPOps allows to deploy consecutive Kafka Streams applications and producers using an easy-to-read and -write pipeline definition.
- **Manage Kafka Connectors**: KPOps connects with your Kafka Connect cluster and deploys, validates, and deletes your connectors.
- **Configure multiple pipelines and steps**: KPOps has various abstractions that simplify configuring multiple pipelines and steps within pipelines by sharing common configuration between different components, such as producers or streaming applications.
- **Handle your topics and schemas**: KPOps not only creates and deletes your topics but also registers and deletes your schemas.
- **Clean termination of Kafka components**: KPOps removes your pipeline components (i.e., Kafka Streams applications) from the Kubernetes cluster _and_ cleans up the component-related states (i.e., removing/resetting offset of Kafka consumer groups).
- **Preview your pipeline changes**: With the KPOps dry-run, you can ensure your pipeline definition is set up correctly. This helps to minimize downtime and prevent potential errors or issues that could impact your production environment.
