# Gemini Capsule Library
A Gemtext renderer designed for data persistence! Or something like that.

Includes...
- Automatic form handling and rendering with many input types (multi select, link input, etc.)
- Capsule wide data persistence through global storage (use form data on other pages for example)
- User defined callbacks for page load and page submission.
- Configurable to work with (hopefully) any Gemini server!

[Hidden Nexus](gemini://hidden.nexus) as a whole was written in a much older, less modular version of GCL. That being said, it's a great example of how far this library can be taken (accounts, settings, captchas).
