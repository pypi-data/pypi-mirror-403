# 🚀 tenzir-ship

`tenzir-ship` helps you ship faster with automated release engineering. Manage
changelogs, generate release notes, and publish GitHub releases.

## ✨ Highlights

- 📝 **Changelog management**: Capture entries via an interactive assistant that
  pulls metadata from Git and GitHub, pre-filling authors and PR references.
- 📦 **Release notes**: Generate release notes from structured entries, ready
  for documentation pipelines or direct publishing.
- 🚀 **GitHub releases**: Publish releases directly to GitHub with generated
  notes and assets.
- 🔧 **CLI and Python API**: Use the command line for interactive workflows or
  the Python API for automation.

## 📦 Installation

`tenzir-ship` ships on PyPI. Use
[`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/) to fetch and execute the
latest compatible version on demand (requires Python 3.12+):

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship --help
```

`uvx` downloads the newest release, runs it in an isolated environment, and
caches the result for snappy subsequent invocations.

## 📚 Documentation

Consult our [user
guide](https://docs.tenzir.com/guides/package-management/maintain-a-changelog)
for an end-to-end walkthrough of maintaining changelogs.

We also provide a dense
[reference](https://docs.tenzir.com/reference/ship-framework) that explains
concepts, abstractions, and CLI details.

## 🐶 Dogfooded Project

The repository ships with [`changelog/`](changelog/), the real changelog project
maintained by the Tenzir team. Explore it to see how
[`config.yaml`](changelog/config.yaml), `unreleased/`, and Markdown release
manifests fit together end-to-end.
