A JupyterLab extension that applies pastel colours to tabs for visual identification when many tabs are open.

Coloured tabs make it easy to identify different notebooks and files at a glance.

Right-click any tab to select a colour from the "Tab Colour" submenu.

## Features

Assign colours to tabs via right-click context menu for easy visual identification when working with multiple notebooks and files.

**Colour options**:

- Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple
- Pastel shades optimised for both light and dark themes

**Key features**:

- Right-click any tab to assign a colour from the "Set Tab Colour" submenu
- Colours persist across browser refreshes via localStorage
- Notebook toolbar matches the active tab colour
- Automatic cleanup when tabs are closed

Yes, this is yet another mass-produced JupyterLab extension that does one trivially simple thing. We are almost embarrassed by how utterly unremarkable it is - just some CSS classes and a context menu. But someone had to do it, and here we are. You're welcome.

To install the extension, execute:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab_colourful_tab_extension
