               "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
               on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
               subsequently incorporated within the Work.
         
            2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
               publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
               Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
         
            3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
               this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
               worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
               (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
               use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
               where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
               by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
               Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
               with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
               institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
               cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
               or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
               or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
               granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
               as of the date such litigation is filed.
         
            4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
               Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
               modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
               meet the following conditions:
         
               (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                   Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
         
               (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                   stating that You changed the files; and
         
               (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                   that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                   attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                   excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                   the Derivative Works; and
         
               (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                   distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                   include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                   within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                   pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                   of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                   as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                   documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                   within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                   wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                   of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                   do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                   notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                   or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                   that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                   as modifying the License.
         
               You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
               may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
               for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
               for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
               reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
               the conditions stated in this License.
         
            5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
               any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
               by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
               this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
               Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
               the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
               with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
         
            6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
               names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
               except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
               origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
         
            7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
               agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
               Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
               WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
               implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
               of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
               PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
               appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
               risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
         
            8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
               whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
               unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
               negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
               liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
               incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
               result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
               Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
               work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
               other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
               has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
         
            9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
               the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
               and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
               or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
               License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
               on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
               of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
               defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
               incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
               of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
         
            END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
         
            APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# Quickstart

## Software Dependencies
UMD requires Tenstorrent's [kernel-mode driver](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-kmd)

Required Ubuntu dependencies:
```
sudo apt install -y libhwloc-dev cmake ninja-build
```

Suggested third-party dependency is Clang 17:
```
wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
chmod u+x llvm.sh
sudo ./llvm.sh 17
```

## IOMMU and Hugepage requirements
To determine whether your system requires hugepage configuration, run the provided script:

```bash
./scripts/iommu_detect.sh
```

### Wormhole and Blackhole
If your system IOMMU is enabled, no hugepage setup is required.
If you don't have IOMMU enabled, than hugepages might be required for some of the driver functionality.
[1G hugepages](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.rst) are required for shared device/host memory.  Techniques for setup:
  * Recommended: the [tt-system-tools](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-system-tools) repository contains a .deb package which will configure your system
      * `sudo dpkg -i tenstorrent-tools_1.1-5_all.deb`
  * Alternative: Metal project provides instructions and a [script](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal/blob/main/INSTALLING.md#step-3-hugepages).
  * For experts:
    * Put system IOMMU in passthrough mode or disable it
    * Allocate 1 or more 1G hugepages
    * Mount the hugetlbfs at /dev/hugepages-1G (e.g. `mount -t hugetlbfs hugetlbfs /dev/hugepages-1G -o mode=777,pagesize=1024M`)

## Install and use UMD

### Python bindings

You can just run the following command, and you'll have tt_umd python package available in your environment:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-umd.git
```

Or if you have UMD downloaded locally you can install from local source:
```
pip install .
```

### Build flow for C++ lib

To build `libdevice.so`:
```
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

To build all components (some are turned off by default, like tests), you can run these commands:
```
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DTT_UMD_BUILD_ALL=ON
cmake --build build
```

To build with GCC, set these environment variables before invoking `cmake`:
```
export CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc
export CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++
```

#### Build debian dev package
```
cmake --build build --target package

# Generates umd-dev-x.y.z-Linux.deb
```

### Enabling Logging

UMD uses a two-level logging system with compile-time and runtime controls.

#### Compile-Time Logging Control

By default, `log_debug` and `log_trace` statements are compiled out of release builds for performance. To include them in the binary:

**Option 1: Enable logging explicitly**
```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DTT_UMD_ENABLE_LOGGING=ON
cmake --build build
```

**Option 2: Use Debug build type** (enables logging automatically)
```bash
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build
```

#### Runtime Logging Control

At runtime, control the logging level using the `TT_LOGGER_LEVEL` environment variable:

```bash
export TT_LOGGER_LEVEL=debug  # Show debug and above
export TT_LOGGER_LEVEL=trace  # Show all log messages (most verbose)
export TT_LOGGER_LEVEL=info   # Default level
```

Available log levels (from most to least verbose):
- `trace` - Most detailed logging, traces program execution
- `debug` - Debugging information useful during development
- `info` - General informational messages (default)
- `warn` - Warning messages for potentially harmful situations
- `error` - Error messages for serious problems
- `critical` - Critical errors that may lead to program termination
- `off` - Disables all logging

**Example: Running with debug logging**
```bash
# Build with logging enabled
cmake -B build -G Ninja -DTT_UMD_ENABLE_LOGGING=ON
cmake --build build

# Run with debug level
TT_LOGGER_LEVEL=debug ./build/bin/your_program
```

# Integration
UMD can be consumed by downstream projects in multiple ways.

## From Source (Python)
You can use tt_umd module by installing it in your current python environment

## From Source (CMake)
You can link `libdevice.so` by linking against the `umd::device` target.

### Using CPM Package Manager
```
CPMAddPackage(
  NAME umd
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY tenstorrent/tt-umd
  GIT_TAG v0.1.0
  VERSION 0.1.0
)
```

### As a submodule/external project
```
add_subdirectory(<path to umd>)
```

## From Prebuilt Binaries

### Ubuntu
```
apt install ./umd-dev-x.y.z-Linux.deb
```

## Simulator Integration
You can run UMD tests without silicon by following setup instructions [here](https://yyz-gitlab.local.tenstorrent.com/tenstorrent/tt-metal).

For UMD, sample tests can be found in `tests/simulation/test_simulation_device.cpp`

# Development workflow

For developing tt-umd, you can see the full set of dependencies in [docker_install_common.sh](.github/docker_install_common.sh)

After that you can look at the section defined above [Install and use UMD](#install-and-use-umd)

## Pre-commit Hook Integration for Formatting and Linting

As part of maintaining consistent code formatting across the project, we have integrated the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework into our workflow. The pre-commit hooks will help automatically check and format code before commits are made, ensuring that we adhere to the project's coding standards.

### What is Pre-commit?

Pre-commit is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. It helps catch common issues early by running a set of hooks before code is committed, automating tasks like:

- Formatting code (e.g., fixing trailing whitespace, enforcing end-of-file newlines)
- Running linters (e.g., `clang-format`, `black`, `flake8`)
- Checking for merge conflicts or other common issues.

For more details on pre-commit, you can visit the [official documentation](https://pre-commit.com/).

### How to Set Up Pre-commit Locally

To set up pre-commit on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Pre-commit**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```
2. **Install the Git Hook Scripts**:
   In your local repository, run the following command to install the pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
   This command will configure your local Git to run the defined hooks automatically before each commit.
3. **Run Pre-commit Hooks Manually**:
   You can also run the hooks manually against all files at any time with:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
### Why You Should Use Pre-commit
By setting up pre-commit locally, you can help maintain the quality of the codebase and ensure that commits consistently meet the project's formatting standards. This saves time during code reviews and reduces the likelihood of code formatting issues slipping into the repository.

Since the hooks run automatically before each commit, you don't need to remember to manually format or check your code, making it easier to maintain consistency.

We strongly encourage all developers to integrate pre-commit into their workflow.

## Formatting C++ code

### Installing clang-format

If you're using an IRD docker, clang-format should be already available.
If you don't have clang-format in your working environment, follow the instructions
on [llvm website](https://apt.llvm.org/) for installing it.

### Formatting files

If working with VSCode, you can copy the provided default settings:
```bash
cp .vscode/default.settings.json .vscode/settings.json
```

From now on, c++ files will be formatted on save (given that clang-format is available).

Note that if you setup pre-commit hook, the files will be automatically formatted when you commit changes.
You can also manually auto format the whole repo using mentioned pre-commit:
```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Bumping the UMD version

There is an automated workflow for creating releases. It is triggered by merging a PR to main which changes the VERSION file.

You can change the VERSION as part of another PR or as an isolated PR. Please also update the CHANGELOG with the exact version you are changeing to.

Once the PR is merged, a draft Release will be created with the generated changelog and artifacts. Please review it and publish it using the tag which exactly matches the version of the release.

# Grayskull End of Life

Grayskull is no longer actively supported by Tenstorrent. [Last UMD commit](https://github.com/tenstorrent/tt-umd/commit/a5b4719b7d44f0c7c953542803faf6851574329a) supporting Grayskull.
