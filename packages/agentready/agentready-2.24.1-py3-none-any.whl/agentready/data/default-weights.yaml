# Default Tier-Based Weight Distribution
#
# This file defines the default weights for all 23 attributes (updated from 25).
# Weights are based on tier priority from research report:
#
# Tier 1 (Essential):  55% total (5×10% + 1×5%, 6 attributes)
# Tier 2 (Critical):   27% total (3% each, 9 attributes)
# Tier 3 (Important):  15% total (3% each, 5 attributes)
# Tier 4 (Advanced):    3% total (1% each, 3 attributes)
# TOTAL:              100% (sum to 1.0)
#
# Missing essentials (especially CLAUDE.md at 10%) has 10x impact vs advanced features (1%)
#
# Changes in v2.10.0:
# - Added dependency_security (Tier 1, 5%) - merged dependency_freshness + security_scanning
# - Removed dependency_freshness (merged into dependency_security)
# - Removed security_scanning (merged into dependency_security)
# - Removed performance_benchmarks (low ROI)
# - Fixed weight sum to 1.0 (was 0.99)
