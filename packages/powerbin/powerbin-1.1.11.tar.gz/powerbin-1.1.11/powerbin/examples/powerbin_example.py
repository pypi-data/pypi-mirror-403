#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Usage example for the PowerBin class.
#
# Input data: Columns 1–4 of sample_data_ngc2273.txt contain x, y coordinates
# of each spaxel, followed by their Signal and Noise.
#
# Capacity specification:
# 1) Additive (array): Provide (S/N)^2 per pixel, which adds up in the
#    Poisson limit. This is the simplest and, for very large datasets
#    (millions of pixels), also the fastest approach.
# 2) Non-additive (function): Provide a callable that computes the bin
#    capacity from its pixel indices. This can model effects like correlated
#    noise. For small or moderate datasets the speed difference is negligible.
#
# S/N Formula:
# The S/N for a bin is calculated as `np.sum(signal) / np.sqrt(np.sum(noise**2))`.
# This is the standard formula for uncorrelated noise and should be the default
# choice for most applications. One would only modify this for special cases,
# such as:
#  - To account for known covariance in the noise between pixels. The example
#    shows a commented-out empirical correction, but this is data-dependent
#    and not a general prescription (see Fig.11 from
#    http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...576A.135G).
#  - To perform complex calculations on each bin (e.g., fitting a model to
#    extract kinematics), which is a possible but advanced use case.

        sn = np.sum(signal[index]) / np.sqrt(np.sum(noise[index]**2))
