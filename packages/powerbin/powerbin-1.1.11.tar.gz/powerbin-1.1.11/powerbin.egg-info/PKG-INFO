This `PowerBin` package provides a Python implementation of the **PowerBin** algorithm — a modern alternative to the classic Voronoi binning method. Like Voronoi binning, it performs 2D adaptive spatial binning to achieve a nearly constant value per bin of a chosen *capacity* (e.g., signal‑to‑noise ratio or any other user‑defined function of the bin spaxels).

**Key advances over the classic method include:**

- **Centroidal Power Diagram:** Produces bins that are nearly round, convex, and connected, and eliminates the disconnected or nested bins that could occur with earlier approaches.

- **Scalability:** The entire algorithm scales with **O(N log N)** complexity, removing the **O(N^2)** bottleneck previously present in both the bin-accretion and regularization steps. This makes processing million‑pixel datasets practical.

- **Stable CPD construction:** Generates the tessellation via a heuristic inspired by packed soap bubbles, avoiding the numerical fragility of formal CPD solvers with realistic non-additive capacities (e.g., correlated noise).

The algorithm combines a fast initial bin-accretion phase with iterative regularization, and is described in detail in `Cappellari (2025) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025MNRAS.544.1432C>`_.

the example programs in the ``powerbin/examples`` directory.
It can be found within the main ``powerbin`` package installation folder
inside `site-packages <https://stackoverflow.com/a/46071447>`_.
The detailed documentation is contained in the docstring of the file
``powerbin/powerbin.py``, or on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/powerbin/>`_.

Minimal example
---------------

Below is a minimal, runnable example. It demonstrates how to use ``PowerBin``
and highlights the two ways to specify the bin capacity. In this example, we
define the capacity as ``(S/N)^2``, so the target capacity is set to ``target_sn**2``.

The capacity can be specified in two forms:

1.  **As an array** (by setting ``additive=True``): This is the simplest approach,
    recommended when the capacity is additive (e.g., when noise is Poissonian,
    the total ``(S/N)^2`` is the sum of the individual pixel values). For very
    large datasets (millions of pixels), this method is also significantly faster.
    For small or moderate datasets, the speed difference is negligible.
2.  **As a function** (by setting ``additive=False``): This provides maximum
    flexibility for complex, non-additive capacity definitions. The S/N for a
    bin is calculated as ``np.sum(signal) / np.sqrt(np.sum(noise**2))``. This
    is the standard formula for uncorrelated noise and should be the default
    choice for most applications. One would only modify this for special cases,
    such as:
    
    - To account for known covariance in the noise between pixels. The example
      code shows a commented-out empirical correction, but this is data-dependent
      and not a general prescription.
    - To perform complex calculations on each bin (e.g., fitting a model to
      extract kinematics), which is a possible but advanced use case.

            sn = np.sum(signal[index]) / np.sqrt(np.sum(noise[index]**2))

            # sn /= 1 + 1.07 * np.log10(len(index))
            return sn**2

    # Perform the binning. The target is target_sn**2 to match the capacity definition.

PowerBin Class
==============

PowerBin Purpose
----------------

Performs 2D adaptive spatial binning using Centroidal Power Diagrams.

This class implements the **PowerBin** algorithm described in 
`Cappellari (2025) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025MNRAS.544.1432C>`_. 
It partitions a set of 2D points (pixels) into bins, aiming for a nearly
constant *capacity* per bin (e.g., signal-to-noise squared).

Key advances over classic Voronoi binning include:

- **Centroidal Power Diagram:** Produces nearly round, convex, and
  connected bins, avoiding issues like disconnected or nested bins.

- **Scalability:** Uses O(N log N) algorithms, making it practical for
  datasets with millions of pixels.

- **Stable Construction:** Employs a robust heuristic for building the
  diagram, avoiding numerical fragility.

The algorithm has two main stages:

1. **Bin Accretion:** Generates an initial set of bin centers.

2. **Regularization:** Iteratively adjusts bin shapes to equalize their
   capacities.

Parameters
----------
xy: array_like of shape (npix, 2)
    Coordinates of the pixels to be binned.

capacity_spec: callable or array_like of shape (npix,)
    The rule for calculating capacity, given in one of two forms:

    - **Callable:** A function ``fun(indices, *args) -> float`` that returns
      the total capacity of a bin containing the pixels at ``indices``.
      This allows for non-additive capacity definitions (for example with
      correlated noise).

    - **Array-like:** A 1D array ``dens`` of length ``npix``, where
      ``dens[j]`` is the additive capacity of pixel ``j``. The capacity of
      a bin is the sum of ``dens`` over its member pixels. This is faster.

target_capacity: float
    The target capacity value for each bin.

pixelsize: float, optional
    The size of a pixel in the input coordinate units. This is used to
    internally work in pixel units for numerical stability. If ``None``,
    it is estimated as the median distance to the second-nearest neighbor.

verbose: int, optional
    Controls the level of printed output:

    - 0: No output.
    - 1: Basic summary (default).
    - 2: Detailed iteration-by-iteration progress.
    - 3: Same as 2, but also plots the binning at each iteration.

regul: bool, optional
    If ``True`` (default), performs the iterative regularization step after
    the initial accretion. If ``False``, only accretion is performed.

args: tuple, optional
    Additional positional arguments passed to ``capacity_spec`` when it is
    a callable function.

maxiter: int, optional
    Maximum number of iterations for the regularization step (default: 50).

Attributes
----------
xy: ndarray of shape (npix, 2)
    The original input pixel coordinates.

bin_num: ndarray of int of shape (npix,)
    An array where ``bin_num[j]`` gives the index of the bin containing
    pixel ``j``. This is the primary output for mapping pixels to bins.

pixel_capacity: ndarray of shape (npix,)
    The capacity of each individual input pixel, derived from
    ``capacity_spec``.

bin_capacity: ndarray of shape (nbin,)
    The final calculated capacity for each output bin.

xybin: ndarray of shape (nbin, 2)
    The coordinates of the Power Diagram generators (bin centers), in the
    same units as the input ``xy``.

rbin: ndarray of shape (nbin,)
    The radii of the Power Diagram generators, in the same units as ``xy``.

npix: ndarray of int of shape (nbin,)
    The number of pixels in each bin.

single: ndarray of bool of shape (nbin,)
    A boolean array indicating which bins have a single pixel.

rms_frac: float
    The fractional root-mean-square scatter of the ``bin_capacity`` values,
    calculated as a percentage for non-single bins.

target_capacity, pixelsize, verbose, args :
    Stored values of the corresponding input parameters.
