    """
    Generate initial bin centers using a bin-accretion algorithm.

    This function computes an initial set of bin generators to serve as a
    starting guess for the subsequent regularization step. It implements the
    bin‑accretion algorithm of Cappellari & Copin (2003) [1], with algorithmic
    improvements that reduce the time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N log N)
    (see Cappellari 2025 [2]).

    The algorithm proceeds as follows:
      1. Identify the "brightest" (highest capacity) unbinned pixel to use as
         a seed for a new bin.
      2. Iteratively "accrete" the nearest unbinned neighboring pixels into
         the current bin.
      3. Stop accretion when the bin is disconnected, becomes too non‑circular,
         or its capacity starts moving away from the target.
      4. Seed a new bin from the next brightest available pixel and repeat
         until all pixels are binned.
      5. Reassign pixels belonging to bins that failed to reach a significant
         fraction of the target capacity to the nearest successful bin.

    Key differences from the original Cappellari & Copin (2003) algorithm:
      * **Neighbor finding**: Pixel neighbors are pre‑computed once using a
        Delaunay triangulation for efficiency, instead of being searched at
        each step.
      * **Bin seeding**: A max‑heap data structure is used to efficiently
        select the brightest unbinned pixel as the next seed in O(log N) time,
        improving over the original O(N) search.
      * **Stopping criterion**: Accretion is guided by a generic
        ``target_capacity`` and stops when the bin's capacity overshoots or
        moves away from this target, rather than simply exceeding a
        signal‑to‑noise threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    xy : array_like of shape (npix, 2)
        Coordinates of the pixels to be binned.

    target_capacity : float
        The target capacity for each bin.

    capacity_spec: callable or array_like of shape (npix,)
        The rule for calculating capacity, given in one of two forms:

        - **Callable:** A function ``fun(indices, *args) -> float`` that returns
          the total capacity of a bin containing the pixels at ``indices``.
          This allows for non-additive capacity definitions (for example with
          correlated noise).

        - **Array-like:** A 1D array ``dens`` of length ``npix``, where
          ``dens[j]`` is the additive capacity of pixel ``j``. The capacity of
          a bin is the sum of ``dens`` over its member pixels. This is faster.

    verbose : int
        Controls the level of printed output:
          * 0 — no output
          * 1 — basic summary (default)
          * 2 — detailed progress
          * 3 — detailed progress plus plots

    args: tuple, optional
        Additional positional arguments passed to ``capacity_spec`` when it is
        a callable function.

    Returns
    -------
    xybin : ndarray of shape (nbin, 2)
        Coordinates of the centroids of the generated bins.

    pixel_capacity: ndarray of shape (npix,)
        The capacity of each individual input pixel, derived from
        ``capacity_spec``.
