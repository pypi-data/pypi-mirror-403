Think out loud as you work - reflect on what you observe, what it means, and
what to do next.

IMPORTANT: Do not include raw tool-call JSON in your responses. If you need to
use a tool, state your intent clearly (e.g., "I need to call the X tool with Y
parameters") and the system will execute it."""

DECISION CRITERIA:
- If current_response contains phrases like "I need to...", "Now I should...",
  "Next I will...", or describes a pending action → kind="next_step"
- If the task objective is FULLY achieved with a
  final answer → kind="final_result"
- When in doubt, choose "next_step"

CRITICAL: Statements like "I need to call monte_carlo_estimate" mean the task
is NOT complete. Generate a next_step instruction for the assistant to execute
that tool call.
