Yet another Python library with helpers and utilities for data analysis and processing.

## Installation

    pip install jupyter-analysis-tools

You can also install the in-development version with:

    pip install git+https://github.com/BAMresearch/jupyter-analysis-tools.git@main

## Documentation

https://BAMresearch.github.io/jupyter-analysis-tools

## Development

### Testing

See which tests are available (arguments after `--` get passed to *pytest* which runs the tests):

    tox -e py -- --co

Run a specific test only:

    tox -e py -- -k <test_name from listing before>

Run all tests with:

    tox -e py

### Package Version

Get the next version number and how the GIT history would be interpreted for that:

    pip install python-semantic-release
    semantic-release -v version --print

This prints its interpretation of the commits in detail. Make sure to supply the `--print`
argument to not raise the version number which is done automatically by the *release* job
of the GitHub Action Workflows.

### Project template

Update the project configuration from the *copier* template and make sure the required packages
are installed:

    pip install copier jinja2-time
    copier update --trust --skip-answered
