class QuantumCircuit(SymbolicsProperties):
    """A class for creating quantum circuits and storing their metadata.

    Instances provide complete descriptions of quantum circuits, along with various associated
    attributes (such as mathematical conditions, including normalization).
    The circuit's input is recorded as a list of :py:class:`~qhronology.quantum.states.QuantumState`
    objects, with the composition of the elements of this forming the total input.
    Similarly, the circuit's transformation on its input is recorded as a list of
    :py:class:`~qhronology.quantum.gates.QuantumGate` objects, with the product of the (linear)
    elements of this list forming the total transformation (e.g., unitary matrix).

    Arguments
    ---------
    inputs : list[QuantumState]
        An ordered list of :py:class:`~qhronology.quantum.states.QuantumState` instances.
        The total input state is the tensor product of these individual states in the order
        in which they appear in ``inputs``.
        Must all have the same value of the ``dim`` property.
        Defaults to ``[]``.
    gates : list[QuantumGate]
        An ordered list of :py:class:`~qhronology.quantum.gates.QuantumGate` instances.
        The total gate is the product of these individual gates in the order in which they appear
        in ``gates``.
        Must all have the same values of the ``dim`` and ``num_systems`` properties.
        Defaults to ``[]``.
    traces : list[int]
        The numerical indices of the subsystems to be traced over.
        Defaults to ``[]``.
    postselections: list[tuple[mat | arr | QuantumObject, int | list[int]]]
        A list of 2-tuples of vectors or matrix operators paired with the first (smallest) index
        of their postselection target systems.
        Must all have the same value of the ``dim`` property.
        Defaults to ``[]``.
    symbols : dict[sym | str, dict[str, Any]]
        A dictionary in which the keys are individual symbols and the values are dictionaries
        of their respective SymPy keyword-argument ``assumptions``.
        The value of the ``symbols`` property of all states in ``inputs`` and gates in ``gates`` are automatically merged into the instance's corresponding ``symbols`` property.
        Defaults to ``{}``.
    conditions : list[tuple[num | sym | str, num | sym | str]]
        A list of :math:`2`-tuples of conditions to be applied to all objects (such as states and
        gates) computed from the circuit.
        All instances of the expression in each tuple's first element are replaced by the
        expression in the respective second element.
        This uses the same format as the SymPy ``subs()`` method.
        The order in which they are applied is simply their order in the list.
        The value of the ``conditions`` property of all states in ``inputs`` and gates in ``gates``
        are automatically merged into the instance's corresponding ``conditions`` property.
        Defaults to ``[]``.

    Note
    ----
    All states, gates, postselections, and measurement operators recorded in the instance must
    share the same dimensionality (i.e., the value of the ``dim`` property).

    Note
    ----
    The sum of the ``num_systems`` properties of the quantum states in ``inputs`` should match
    that of each of the gates in ``gates``.

            (measurement probabilities) when ``observable`` is ``False``
            (``operators`` is a list of Kraus operators or projectors :math:`\\Kraus_i`)
          - :math:`p_i = \\trace[\\Observable_i \\op{\\rho}]`
            (expectation values) when ``observable`` is ``True``
            (``operators`` is a list of observables :math:`\\Observable_i`)

        - When ``statistics`` is ``False``, the (reduced) state (:math:`\\op{\\rho}`)
          (residing on the systems indicated in ``targets``) is measured and mutated it according
          to its predicted post-measurement form (i.e., the sum of all possible measurement
          outcomes). This yields the transformed states:

          - When ``observable`` is ``False``:

          .. math:: \\op{\\rho}^\\prime = \\sum_i \\Kraus_i \\op{\\rho} \\Kraus_i^\\dagger.

             \\op{\\rho}^\\prime
                 = \\sum_i \\trace[\\Observable_i \\op{\\rho}] \\Observable_i.

        In the case where ``operators`` contains only a single item (:math:`\\Kraus`),
        and the current state (:math:`\\ket{\\psi}`) is a vector form,
        the transformation of the state is in accordance with the rule

        .. math::

           \\ket{\\psi^\\prime} = \\frac{\\Kraus \\ket{\\psi}}

        when ``observable`` is ``False``. In all other mutation cases, the post-measurement state
        is a matrix, even if the pre-measurement state was a vector.

        The items in the list ``operators`` can also be vectors (e.g., :math:`\\ket{\\xi_i}`),
        in which case each is converted into its corresponding operator matrix representation
        (e.g., :math:`\\ket{\\xi_i}\\bra{\\xi_i}`) prior to any measurements.

        Arguments
        ---------
        operators : list[mat | arr | QuantumObject]
            The operator(s) with which to perform the measurement.
            These would typically be a (complete) set of Kraus operators forming a POVM,
            a (complete) set of (orthogonal) projectors forming a PVM,
            or a set of observables constituting a complete basis for the relevant state space.
        targets : int | list[int]
            The numerical indices of the system(s) to be measured.
            They must be consecutive, and their number must match the number of systems spanned
            by all given operators.
            Indexing begins at ``0``.
            All other systems are discarded (traced over) in the course of performing the
            measurement.
        observable : bool
            Whether to treat the items in ``operators`` as observables
            (as opposed to Kraus operators or projectors).
            Defaults to ``False``.
        statistics : bool
            Whether to return a list of probabilities (``True``)
            or the post-measurement state (``False``).
            Defaults to ``False``.

        Returns
        -------
        list[num | sym]
            A list of probabilities corresponding to each operator given in ``operators``.
            Returned only if ``statistics`` is ``True``.
        QuantumState
            A quantum state that takes the form of the post-measurement probabilistic sum
            of all outcomes of measurements corresponding to each operator given in ``operators``.
            Returned only if ``statistics`` is ``False``.

            Defaults to ``(1, 1)``.
        uniform_spacing : bool

            Defaults to ``False``.
        force_separation : bool
            Whether to force the horizontal gate separation to be exactly the value given
            in ``sep`` for all gates in the circuit.
            When not ``False``, the value of ``uniform_spacing`` is ignored.

            A string specifying the style for the circuit visualization to take.
