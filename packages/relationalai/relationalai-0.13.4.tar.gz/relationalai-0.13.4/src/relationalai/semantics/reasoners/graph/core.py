        Visualize the graph with `gravis`.

        Set the `gravis_style` keyword argument, a dictionary containing
        gravis styling directives for nodes and edges, to customize
        the appearance of the graph.

        By default, this method will fetch all necessary (node, edge, and
        node/edge property) data and cache it locally. To use the most
        recently cached data instead of fetching fresh data, set
        the `use_fetch_cache` argument to `True`; this is useful
        to tighten the iteration loop when customizing the visualization.

        By default, this method uses the `gravis.vis(...)` method for visualization.
        `vis` builds an interactive, two-dimensional graph view using `vis.js`
        (DOM/canvas). This method is simple and lightweight, but lacks some
        styling features (e.g., separate arrow colors and per-element opacity),
        so those options are ignored. Alternatively, set the `use_gravis_three`
        argument to `True` to use `gravis.three(...)`, which builds an interactive,
        three-dimensional graph view using `3d-force-graph`, which in turn uses
        `three.js`/WebGL. You get a draggable three-dimensional scene with
        force-layout physics; some features (e.g., node borders, edge labels)
        aren’t available compared to other back-ends.

        Any other keyword arguments will be passed through to `gravis`, merged
        with the following default keyword arguments.
        ```
            "node_label_data_source": "label",

        Notes
        -----
        The ``neighbor()`` method, called with no parameters, computes and caches
        the full neighbor relationship, providing efficient reuse across multiple
        calls to ``neighbor()``. In contrast, ``neighbor(of=subset)`` computes a
        constrained relationship specific to the passed-in ``subset`` and that
        call site. When a significant fraction of the neighbor relation is needed
        across a program, ``neighbor()`` is typically more efficient; this is the
        typical case. Use ``neighbor(of=subset)`` only when small subsets of the
        neighbor relationship are needed collectively across the program.

        the full inneighbor relationship, providing efficient reuse across multiple
        calls to ``inneighbor()``. In contrast, ``inneighbor(of=subset)`` computes a
        constrained relationship specific to the passed-in ``subset`` and that

        across a program, ``inneighbor()`` is typically more efficient; this is the

        Notes
        -----
        The ``common_neighbor(full=True)`` method computes and caches the full common
        neighbor relationship for all pairs of nodes, providing efficient reuse across
        multiple calls. This can be expensive as the result can contain O(|E|²) or
        O(|V|³) tuples depending on graph density.

        Calling ``common_neighbor()`` without arguments raises a ``ValueError``,
        to ensure awareness and explicit acknowledgement (``full=True``) of this cost.

        In contrast, ``common_neighbor(from_=subset)`` constrains the computation to
        tuples with the first position in the passed-in ``subset``. The result is
        not cached; it is specific to the call site. When a significant fraction of
        the common neighbor relation is needed across a program, ``common_neighbor(full=True)``
        is typically more efficient. Use ``common_neighbor(from_=subset)`` only
        when small subsets of the common neighbor relationship are needed
        collectively across the program.

        The ``to`` parameter can be used together with ``from_`` to further
        constrain the computation: ``common_neighbor(from_=subset_a, to=subset_b)``
        computes common neighbors only for node pairs where the first node is in
        ``subset_a`` and the second node is in ``subset_b``. (Since ``common_neighbor``
        is symmetric in its first two positions, using ``to`` without ``from_`` would
        be functionally redundant, and is not allowed.)

        The ``between`` parameter provides another way to constrain the computation:
        Unlike ``from_`` and ``to``, which allow you to independently constrain the first
        and second positions in ``common_neighbor`` tuples to sets of nodes, ``between``
        allows you to constrain the first and second positions, jointly, to specific pairs
        of nodes.

        The ``weighted_outdegree()`` method, called with no parameters, computes and caches
        the full weighted outdegree relationship, providing efficient reuse across multiple
        calls to ``weighted_outdegree()``. In contrast, ``weighted_outdegree(of=subset)`` computes a
        constrained relationship specific to the passed-in ``subset`` and that
        call site. When a significant fraction of the weighted outdegree relation is needed
        across a program, ``weighted_outdegree()`` is typically more efficient; this is the
        typical case. Use ``weighted_outdegree(of=subset)`` only when small subsets of the
        weighted outdegree relationship are needed collectively across the program.

        Degree centrality is a measure of a node's importance, defined as its

        For unweighted graphs without self-loops, this value will be at most 1.0;

        Notes

        Eigenvector centrality is a measure of the centrality or importance
        of a node in a graph based on finding the eigenvector associated
        with the top eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. We use the power
        method to compute the eigenvector in our implementation. Note that
        the power method `requires the adjacency matrix to be diagonalizable <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration>`_
        and will only converge if the absolute value of the top 2
        eigenvalues is distinct. Thus, if the graph you are using has an
        adjacency matrix that is not diagonalizable or the top two
        eigenvalues are not distinct, this method will not converge.

        In the case of weighted graphs, weights are assumed to be non-negative.

            A binary relationship where each tuple represents a node and its
            betweenness centrality.

        Relationship Schema
        -------------------
        ``betweenness_centrality(node, centrality)``

        * **node** (*Node*): The node.
        * **centrality** (*Float*): The betweenness centrality of the node.

        Supported Graph Types
        ---------------------
        | Graph Type | Supported | Notes                |
        | :--------- | :-------- | :------------------- |
        | Undirected | Yes       |                      |
        | Directed   | Yes       |                      |
        | Weighted   | Yes       | Weights are ignored. |

        Notes
        -----

        Calculating betweenness centrality involves computing all of the shortest paths between
        every pair of nodes in a graph and can be expensive to calculate exactly. The
        `betweenness_centrality` relation gives an approximation using the
        [Brandes-Pich](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218127407018403)
        algorithm, which samples nodes uniformly at random and performs single-source
        shortest-path computations from those nodes.

        This implementation nominally samples 100 nodes, yielding time complexity of
        `100 * O(|V|+|E|))`. If the graph has fewer than 100 nodes, it reduces to the
        [Brandes algorithm](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/brandes01centrality.pdf),
        with time complexity `O(|V|(|V|+|E|))` for unweighted graphs.

        Notes
        -----
        This relationship contains triples of nodes `(a, b, c)` representing
        unique triangles.

        For **undirected graphs**, uniqueness of each triangle is guaranteed
        because the relationship only contains triples where `a < b < c`.

        For **directed graphs**, the triple `(a, b, c)` represents a triangle
        with directed edges `(a, b)`, `(b, c)`, and `(c, a)`, and is unique up
        to ordering of the nodes and direction of the edges. `unique_triangle`
        only contains triples such that `a < b`, `a < c`, and `b != c`. For
        example, the triples `(1, 2, 3)` and `(1, 3, 2)` represent two unique
        directed triangles.

        The ``triangle_count()`` method, called with no parameters, computes and caches
        the full triangle count relationship, providing efficient reuse across multiple
        calls to ``triangle_count()``. In contrast, ``triangle_count(of=subset)`` computes a
        constrained relationship specific to the passed-in ``subset`` and that
        call site. When a significant fraction of the triangle count relation is needed
        across a program, ``triangle_count()`` is typically more efficient; this is the
        typical case. Use ``triangle_count(of=subset)`` only when small subsets of the
        triangle count relationship are needed collectively across the program.

        Notes
        -----
        This method finds K-clique communities (with `K = 3`) using the
        `percolation method <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_percolation_method>`_.
        A triangle community is the union of nodes of all triangles that can
        be reached from one another by adjacent triangles---that is,
        triangles that share exactly two nodes.

        For a given undirected graph `G`, the algorithm works as follows:
        First, all triangles in `G` are enumerated and assigned a unique
        label, each of which becomes a node in a new graph called the
        **clique-graph** of `G`, where two nodes in this new graph are
        connected by an edge if the corresponding triangles share exactly two
        nodes, i.e., the corresponding triangles are adjacent in `G`. Next,
        the connected components of the clique-graph of `G` are computed and
        then assigned community labels. Finally, each node in the original
        graph is assigned the community label of the triangle to which it
        belongs. Nodes that are not contained in any triangle are not
        assigned a community label. This algorithm is not supported for
        directed graphs since adjacency is not defined for directed
        triangles.

        Notes
        -----
        The local clustering coefficient for node `v` is::

            (2 * num_neighbor_edges(v)) / (ext_degree(v) * (ext_degree(v) - 1))

        where `num_neighbor_edges(v)` is the number of edges between
        the neighbors of node `v`, and `ext_degree(v)` is the degree of the
        node excluding self-loops. If `ext_degree(v)` is less than 2,
        the local clustering coefficient is 0.0.

        The ``local_clustering_coefficient()`` method, called with no parameters, computes
        and caches the full local clustering coefficient relationship, providing efficient
        reuse across multiple calls to ``local_clustering_coefficient()``. In contrast,
        ``local_clustering_coefficient(of=subset)`` computes a constrained relationship
        specific to the passed-in ``subset`` and that call site. When a significant fraction
        of the local clustering coefficient relation is needed across a program,
        ``local_clustering_coefficient()`` is typically more efficient; this is the typical
        case. Use ``local_clustering_coefficient(of=subset)`` only when small subsets of the
        local clustering coefficient relationship are needed collectively across the program.

        Notes
        -----
        There is a slight difference between `transitive closure` and
        `reachable_from`. The transitive closure of a binary relation E is the
        smallest relation that contains E and is transitive. When E is the
        edge set of a graph, the transitive closure of E does not include
        (u, u) if u is isolated. `reachable_from` is a different binary
        relation in which any node u is always reachable from u. In
        particular, `transitive closure` is a more general concept than
        `reachable_from`.

        Relationship
            A binary relationship where each tuple represents a node and a

        Relationship Schema
        -------------------
        ``reachable(from_node, to_node)``

        * **from_node** (*Node*): The node from which the path originates.
        * **to_node** (*Node*): The node that is reachable from the first node.

        | Weighted   | Yes       | Weights are ignored. |

        Notes
        -----
        The ``reachable(full=True)`` method computes and caches the full
        reachable relationship, providing efficient reuse across multiple calls. In
        contrast, ``reachable(from_=subset)`` or ``reachable(to=subset)``
        compute constrained relationships specific to the passed-in subset and call
        site. When a significant fraction of the reachable relation is needed,
        ``reachable(full=True)`` is typically more efficient. Use constrained
        variants only when small subsets are needed.

        In directed graphs, the ``reachable`` relationship is asymmetric: node B
        may be reachable from node A without node A being reachable from node B. This
        asymmetry means that ``from_`` and ``to`` parameters have distinct,
        non-interchangeable meanings.

        **Important:** Simultaneous use of ``from_`` and ``to`` parameters is not
        yet supported. The ``between`` parameter is also not yet supported. If
        you need these capabilities, please reach out.

        There is a slight difference between `transitive closure` and
        `reachable`. The transitive closure of a binary relation E is the
        smallest relation that contains E and is transitive. When E is the
        edge set of a graph, the transitive closure of E does not include
        (u, u) if u is isolated. `reachable` is a different binary
        relation in which any node u is always reachable from u. In
        particular, `transitive closure` is a more general concept than
        `reachable`.

    def weakly_connected_component(self, *, of: Optional[Relationship] = None):
        """Returns a binary relationship that maps each node to its weakly connected component.

        A weakly connected component is a subgraph where for every pair of
        nodes, there is a path between them in the underlying undirected graph.
        For undirected graphs, this is equivalent to finding the connected
        components.

        Parameters
        ----------
        of : Relationship, optional
            A unary relationship containing a subset of the graph's nodes. When
            provided, constrains the domain of the weakly connected component
            computation: only component memberships of nodes in this relationship
            are returned.

        Returns
        -------
        Relationship
            A binary relationship where each tuple represents a node and the
            identifier of the component it belongs to.

        Relationship Schema
        -------------------
        ``weakly_connected_component(node, component_id)``

        * **node** (*Node*): The node.
        * **component_id** (*Node*): The identifier for the component.

        Supported Graph Types
        ---------------------
        | Graph Type | Supported | Notes                |
        | :--------- | :-------- | :------------------- |
        | Undirected | Yes       |                      |
        | Directed   | Yes       |                      |
        | Weighted   | Yes       | Weights are ignored. |

        Notes
        -----
        The ``component_id`` is the node with the minimum ID within each
        component.

        The ``weakly_connected_component()`` method, called with no parameters,
        computes and caches the full weakly connected component relationship,
        providing efficient reuse across multiple calls to
        ``weakly_connected_component()``.

        In contrast, ``weakly_connected_component(of=subset)`` computes a constrained
        relationship specific to the passed-in ``subset`` and that call site.

        Note that the constrained computation requires working over all nodes
        in the components containing the nodes in ``subset``. When that set
        of nodes constitutes an appreciable fraction of the graph, the constrained
        computation may be less efficient than computing the full relationship.
        Use ``weakly_connected_component(of=subset)`` only when small subsets of
        the weakly connected component relationship are needed collectively
        across the program, and the associated components cover only a small
        part of the graph.

        Notes
        -----
        This method is used to determine the range of possible diameter
        values in the graph. This is done by selecting a number of random
        nodes in the graph and taking the maximum of all shortest paths
        lengths to the rest of the graph. This gives a range per node.
        Then, the intersection of these ranges is taken and the final range
        is returned.

        For disconnected graphs, `diameter_range` returns the diameter range
        of the largest (weakly) connected component. This behavior deviates
        from many graph theory resources, which typically define the diameter
        of a disconnected graph as infinity.

            Jaccard similarity scores for the specific node pairs in
            this relationship are computed and returned. Mutually exclusive
            with other parameters.
            Default is ``None``.

        Notes
        -----
        The **unweighted** Jaccard similarity between two nodes is the ratio of
        the size of the intersection to the size of the union of their
        neighbors (or out-neighbors for directed graphs).

        The **weighted** Jaccard similarity considers the weights of the edges.
        The definition used here is taken from the reference noted below. It is
        the ratio between two quantities:

        1.  **Numerator**: For every other node `w` in the graph, find the
            minimum of the edge weights `(u, w)` and `(v, w)`, and sum these
            minimums.
        2.  **Denominator**: For every other node `w` in the graph, find the
            maximum of the edge weights `(u, w)` and `(v, w)`, and sum these
            maximums.

        If an edge does not exist, its weight is considered 0.0. This can be
        better understood via the following calculation for the weighted
        example below.

        | node id | edge weights to node 1 | edge weights to node 2 | min  | max  |
        | :------ | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :--- | :--- |
        | 1       | 0.0                    | 1.6                    | 0.0  | 1.6  |
        | 2       | 1.6                    | 0.0                    | 0.0  | 1.6  |
        | 3       | 1.4                    | 0.46                   | 0.46 | 1.4  |
        | 4       | 0.0                    | 0.0                    | 0.0  | 0.0  |

        The weighted Jaccard similarity between node 1 and 2 is then:
        `0.46 / (1.6 + 1.6 + 1.4) = 0.1`.

        Edge weights are assumed to be non-negative, so the neighborhood
        vectors contain only non-negative elements. Therefore, the Jaccard
        similarity score is always between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.

        The ``jaccard_similarity(full=True)`` method computes and caches
        the full Jaccard similarity relationship for all pairs of nodes,
        providing efficient reuse across multiple calls. This can be expensive
        as the result can contain O(|V|²) tuples.

        Calling ``jaccard_similarity()`` without arguments raises a ``ValueError``,
        to ensure awareness and explicit acknowledgement (``full=True``) of this cost.

        In contrast, ``jaccard_similarity(from_=subset)`` constrains the computation to
        tuples with the first position in the passed-in ``subset``. The result is
        not cached; it is specific to the call site. When a significant fraction of
        the Jaccard similarity relation is needed across a program,
        ``jaccard_similarity(full=True)`` is typically more efficient. Use
        ``jaccard_similarity(from_=subset)`` only when small subsets of
        the Jaccard similarity relationship are needed
        collectively across the program.

        The ``to`` parameter can be used together with ``from_`` to further
        constrain the computation: ``jaccard_similarity(from_=subset_a, to=subset_b)``
        computes Jaccard similarity scores only for node pairs where the first node is in
        ``subset_a`` and the second node is in ``subset_b``. (Since ``jaccard_similarity``
        is symmetric in its first two positions, using ``to`` without ``from_`` would
        be functionally redundant, and is not allowed.)

        The ``between`` parameter provides another way to constrain the computation.
        Unlike ``from_`` and ``to``, which allow you to independently constrain the first
        and second positions in ``jaccard_similarity`` tuples to sets of nodes, ``between``
        allows you constrain the first and second positions, jointly, to specific pairs
        of nodes.

        The cosine similarity measures the similarity between two nodes based
        on the angle between their neighborhood vectors. The score ranges from
        0.0 to 1.0, inclusive, where 1.0 indicates identical sets of neighbors.

        Parameters
        ----------
        full : bool, optional
            If ``True``, computes the cosine similarity for all pairs
            of nodes in the graph. This computation can be expensive for large graphs,
            as the result can scale quadratically in the number of nodes. Mutually exclusive
            with other parameters.
            Default is ``None``.
        from_ : Relationship, optional
            A unary relationship containing a subset of the graph's nodes. When
            provided, constrains the domain of the cosine similarity computation: only
            cosine similarity scores for node pairs where the first node is
            in this relationship are computed and returned. Mutually exclusive with
            ``full`` and ``between``.
            Default is ``None``.
        to : Relationship, optional
            A unary relationship containing a subset of the graph's nodes. Can only
            be used together with the ``from_`` parameter. When provided with ``from_``,
            constrains the domain of the cosine similarity computation: only
            cosine similarity scores for node pairs where the first node is
            in ``from_`` and the second node is in ``to`` are computed and returned.
            Default is ``None``.
        between : Relationship, optional
            A binary relationship containing pairs of nodes. When provided,
            constrains the domain of the cosine similarity computation: only
            cosine similarity scores for the specific node pairs in
            this relationship are computed and returned. Mutually exclusive
            with other parameters.
            Default is ``None``.

        Returns
        -------
        Relationship
            A ternary relationship where each tuple represents a pair of nodes
            and their cosine similarity.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If ``full`` is provided with any other parameter.
            If ``between`` is provided with any other parameter.
            If ``from_`` is provided with any parameter other than ``to``.
            If none of ``full``, ``from_``, or ``between`` is provided.
            If ``full`` is not ``True`` or ``None``.
        AssertionError
            If ``from_``, ``to``, or ``between`` is not a ``Relationship``.
            If ``from_``, ``to``, or ``between`` is not attached to the same model as the graph.
            If ``from_``, ``to``, or ``between`` does not contain the graph's ``Node`` concept.
            If ``from_`` or ``to`` is not a unary relationship.
            If ``between`` is not a binary relationship.

        Notes
        -----
        The cosine similarity is defined as the normalized inner product of
        two vectors representing the neighborhoods of the nodes `u` and `v`.
        For directed graphs, only out-neighbors are considered.

        * For **unweighted** graphs, the vector for a node `u` contains a 1
            for each neighbor and a 0 for each non-neighbor.
        * For **weighted** graphs, the vector for a node `u` contains the
            edge weight for each neighbor and a 0 for each non-neighbor.

        Edge weights are assumed to be non-negative, so the neighborhood
        vectors contain only non-negative elements. Therefore, the cosine
        similarity score is always between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.

        The ``cosine_similarity(full=True)`` method computes and caches
        the full cosine similarity relationship for all pairs of nodes,
        providing efficient reuse across multiple calls. This can be expensive
        as the result can contain O(|V|²) tuples.

        Calling ``cosine_similarity()`` without arguments raises a ``ValueError``,
        to ensure awareness and explicit acknowledgement (``full=True``) of this cost.

        In contrast, ``cosine_similarity(from_=subset)`` constrains the computation to
        tuples with the first position in the passed-in ``subset``. The result is
        not cached; it is specific to the call site. When a significant fraction of
        the cosine similarity relation is needed across a program,
        ``cosine_similarity(full=True)`` is typically more efficient. Use
        ``cosine_similarity(from_=subset)`` only when small subsets of
        the cosine similarity relationship are needed
        collectively across the program.

        The ``to`` parameter can be used together with ``from_`` to further
        constrain the computation: ``cosine_similarity(from_=subset_a, to=subset_b)``
        computes cosine similarity scores only for node pairs where the first node is in
        ``subset_a`` and the second node is in ``subset_b``. (Since ``cosine_similarity``
        is symmetric in its first two positions, using ``to`` without ``from_`` would
        be functionally redundant, and is not allowed.)

        The ``between`` parameter provides another way to constrain the computation.
        Unlike ``from_`` and ``to``, which allow you to independently constrain the first
        and second positions in ``cosine_similarity`` tuples to sets of nodes, ``between``
        allows you constrain the first and second positions, jointly, to specific pairs
        of nodes.

        The Adamic-Adar index is a similarity measure between two nodes based
        on the amount of shared neighbors between them, giving more weight to
        common neighbors that are less connected.

        Parameters
        ----------
        full : bool, optional
            If ``True``, computes the Adamic-Adar index for all pairs of nodes in
            the graph. This computation can be expensive for large graphs, as
            dependencies can scale quadratically in the number of edges or cubically
            in the number of nodes. Mutually exclusive with other parameters.
            Default is ``None``.
        from_ : Relationship, optional
            A unary relationship containing a subset of the graph's nodes. When
            provided, constrains the domain of the Adamic-Adar computation: only
            Adamic-Adar indices for node pairs where the first node is in this relationship
            are computed and returned. Mutually exclusive with ``full`` and ``between``.
            Default is ``None``.
        to : Relationship, optional
            A unary relationship containing a subset of the graph's nodes. Can only
            be used together with the ``from_`` parameter. When provided with ``from_``,
            constrains the domain of the Adamic-Adar computation: only Adamic-Adar
            indices for node pairs where the first node is in ``from_`` and the
            second node is in ``to`` are computed and returned.
            Default is ``None``.
        between : Relationship, optional
            A binary relationship containing pairs of nodes. When provided,
            constrains the domain of the Adamic-Adar computation: only Adamic-Adar
            indices for the specific node pairs in this relationship are computed
            and returned. Mutually exclusive with other parameters.
            Default is ``None``.

        Returns
        -------
        Relationship
            A ternary relationship where each tuple represents a pair of nodes
            and their Adamic-Adar index.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If ``full`` is provided with any other parameter.
            If ``between`` is provided with any other parameter.
            If ``from_`` is provided with any parameter other than ``to``.
            If none of ``full``, ``from_``, or ``between`` is provided.
            If ``full`` is not ``True`` or ``None``.
        AssertionError
            If ``from_``, ``to``, or ``between`` is not a ``Relationship``.
            If ``from_``, ``to``, or ``between`` is not attached to the same model as the graph.
            If ``from_``, ``to``, or ``between`` does not contain the graph's ``Node`` concept.
            If ``from_`` or ``to`` is not a unary relationship.
            If ``between`` is not a binary relationship.

        Relationship Schema

        * **node_u** (*Node*): The first node in the pair.
        * **node_v** (*Node*): The second node in the pair.
        * **score** (*Float*): The Adamic-Adar index of the pair.

        Supported Graph Types

        | Graph Type | Supported | Notes                |
        | :--------- | :-------- | :------------------- |

        Notes
        -----
        The Adamic-Adar index for nodes `u` and `v` is defined as the sum of
        the inverse logarithmic degree of their common neighbors `w`::

            AA(u,v) = Σ (1 / log(degree(w)))

        The ``adamic_adar(full=True)`` method computes and caches the full Adamic-Adar
        relationship for all pairs of nodes, providing efficient reuse across
        multiple calls. This can be expensive as dependencies can contain O(|E|²) or
        O(|V|³) tuples depending on graph density.

        Calling ``adamic_adar()`` without arguments raises a ``ValueError``,
        to ensure awareness and explicit acknowledgement (``full=True``) of this cost.

        In contrast, ``adamic_adar(from_=subset)`` constrains the computation to
        tuples with the first position in the passed-in ``subset``. The result is
        not cached; it is specific to the call site. When a significant fraction of
        the Adamic-Adar relation is needed across a program, ``adamic_adar(full=True)``
        is typically more efficient. Use ``adamic_adar(from_=subset)`` only
        when small subsets of the Adamic-Adar relationship are needed
        collectively across the program.

        The ``to`` parameter can be used together with ``from_`` to further
        constrain the computation: ``adamic_adar(from_=subset_a, to=subset_b)``
        computes Adamic-Adar indices only for node pairs where the first node is in
        ``subset_a`` and the second node is in ``subset_b``. (Since ``adamic_adar``
        is symmetric in its first two positions, using ``to`` without ``from_`` would
        be functionally redundant, and is not allowed.)

        The ``between`` parameter provides another way to constrain the computation.
        Unlike ``from_`` and ``to``, which allow you to independently constrain the first
        and second positions in ``adamic_adar`` tuples to sets of nodes, ``between``
        allows you constrain the first and second positions, jointly, to specific pairs
        of nodes.

            A unary relationship containing a subset of the graph's nodes. When
            provided, constrains the domain of the preferential attachment computation: only

            Default is ``None``.
        to : Relationship, optional
            A unary relationship containing a subset of the graph's nodes. Can only
            be used together with the ``from_`` parameter. When provided with ``from_``,
            constrains the domain of the preferential attachment computation: only
            preferential attachment scores for node pairs where the first node is
            in ``from_`` and the second node is in ``to`` are computed and returned.
            Default is ``None``.
        between : Relationship, optional
            A binary relationship containing pairs of nodes. When provided,
            constrains the domain of the preferential attachment computation: only
            preferential attachment scores for the specific node pairs in
            this relationship are computed and returned. Mutually exclusive

        | Weighted   | Yes       | Weights are ignored. |

        Notes
        -----
        The ``preferential_attachment(full=True)`` method computes and caches
        the full preferential attachment relationship for all pairs of nodes,
        providing efficient reuse across multiple calls. This can be expensive
        as the result contains O(|V|²) tuples.

        Calling ``preferential_attachment()`` without arguments raises a ``ValueError``,
        to ensure awareness and explicit acknowledgement (``full=True``) of this cost.

        In contrast, ``preferential_attachment(from_=subset)`` constrains the computation to
        tuples with the first position in the passed-in ``subset``. The result is
        not cached; it is specific to the call site. When a significant fraction of
        the preferential attachment relation is needed across a program,
        ``preferential_attachment(full=True)`` is typically more efficient. Use
        ``preferential_attachment(from_=subset)`` only when small subsets of
        the preferential attachment relationship are needed
        collectively across the program.

        The ``to`` parameter can be used together with ``from_`` to further
        constrain the computation: ``preferential_attachment(from_=subset_a, to=subset_b)``
        computes preferential attachment scores only for node pairs where the first node is in
        ``subset_a`` and the second node is in ``subset_b``. (Since ``preferential_attachment``
        is symmetric in its first two positions, using ``to`` without ``from_``would
        be functionally redundant, and is not allowed.)

        The ``between`` parameter provides another way to constrain the computation.
        Unlike ``from_`` and ``to``, which allow you to independently constrain the first
        and second positions in ``preferential_attachment`` tuples to sets of nodes, ``between``
        allows you constrain the first and second positions, jointly, to specific pairs
        of nodes.

        Notes
        -----
        This implementation of Infomap minimizes the map equation via a
        Louvain-like optimization heuristic; this is often referred to as
        "core" Infomap in the literature. Computation of the ergodic node
        visit frequencies is done via regularized power iteration, with
        regularization via a uniform teleportation probability of 0.15,
        matching the nominal selection in the literature.

        This method maps nodes to community assignments via asynchronous

        Parameters
        ----------
        max_sweeps : int, optional
            The maximum number of sweeps for label propagation to perform.
            Must be a positive integer. Default is 20.
        randomization_seed : int, optional
            The random number generator seed for the run. Must be a positive
            integer. Default is 8675309.
        diagnostic_info : bool, optional
            If ``True``, returns diagnostic information alongside
            community assignments. If ``False`` (default), returns only community
            assignments.

        Returns
        -------
        Relationship or tuple of Relationships
            If ``diagnostic_info`` is ``False`` (default), returns a binary
            relationship where each tuple represents a node and its community
            assignment.

            If ``diagnostic_info`` is ``True``, returns a tuple of
            ``(community_assignments, diagnostic_info)`` where:

            - ``community_assignments`` is the binary relationship described above
            - ``diagnostic_info`` is a unary relationship containing a diagnostic
              string describing the algorithm's termination behavior.

        Relationship Schema
        -------------------
        When ``diagnostic_info=False`` (default):

        ``label_propagation(node, community_label)``

        * **node** (*Node*): The node.
        * **community_label** (*Integer*): The label of the community the node
          belongs to.

        When ``diagnostic_info=True``, returns two relationships:

        - ``community_assignments(node, community_label)`` as described above; and
        - ``diagnostic_info(diganostic_string)``

        * **diagnostic_string** (*String*): A diagnostic string describing the
          algorithm's convergence and termination behavior.

        Notes
        -----
        This implementation of asynchronous label propagation breaks ties
        between neighboring labels with equal cumulative edge weight (and
        frequency in the unweighted case) uniformly at random, but with a
        static seed.

        **Unweighted Graph Example**

        Compute community assignments for each node in an undirected graph. Here,
        an undirected dumbbell graph resolves into two communities, namely its
        two constituent three-cliques.

        **Weighted Graph Example**

        Compute community assignments for each node in an undirected weighted
        graph. Here, a six-clique has the edges forming a dumbbell graph
        within the six-clique strongly weighted, and the remaining edges
        weakly weighted. The graph resolves into two communities, namely the
        two three-cliques constituent of the dumbbell embedded in the
        six-clique.
