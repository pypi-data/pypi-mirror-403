class DependencyAnalysis(visitor.Visitor):
    """
    A visitor to perform dependency analysis in logicals and store the result in a
    DependencyInfo object.

    The dependency analysis is performed for Logical nodes in 3 steps:

    1. form clusters of children that are mutually dependent, because they are binders (like
    lookups and aggregates) that have variables in common.

    2. compute dependencies between the clusters based on input and outputs.

    3. attempt to merge clusters that could form larger clusters.

    Consider the following example, where we are computing dependencies for the numbered nodes:

        Logical
    |1|    Edges(edges)
    |2|    i(edges, i)
    |3|    Logical ⇑[v]
              Logical ⇑[j=None]
                j(edges, j)
              count([edges, j], [i], [v])
    |4|    i < 10
    |5|    i < v
    |6|    Logical ⇑[v_2=None]
              max([i], [], [v, v_2])
    |7|    → output[i](v, v_2 as 'v2')

    In step 1., we merge (1,2,4) because they have `edges` and `i` in common, but nothing
    else. In particular, (5) is not merged as it also depends on v.

    In step 2. we compute dependencies:
      (1,2,4)
      (3) -> (1,2,4)
      (5) -> (1,2,4), (3)
      (6) -> (1,2,4), (3), (5)
      (7) -> (1,2,4), (3), (5), (6)

    For this example, step 3. does not change anything.

    This result can be interpreted as, in order to compute task 6, tasks (1,2,4), (3) and (5)
    must hold. This means that a compiler pass that extracts the logical in task 6 into its
    own top-level logical must bring these dependencies together.

    To illustrate the need for step 3, consider this example:

        Logical
    |1|    Edge(edge)
    |2|    i(edge, i)
    |3|    Edge(edge_2)
    |4|    j(edge_2, j)
    |5|    i = j
    |6|    Logical ⇑[res=None]
            .....
    |7|    → output[edge, j, i](i, res)

    The result of step 2 is the following:
    (1,2)
    (3,4)
    (5) -> (1,2), (3,4)
    (6) -> (1,2), (3,4), (5)
    (7) -> (1,2), (3,4), (5), (6)

    Step 3 observes that task (5) is a bridge between (1,2) and (3,4), so that merging those
    3 clusters together yields a consistent cluster. So the result is:

    (1,2,3,4,5)
    (6) -> (1,2,3,4,5)
    (7) -> (1,2,3,4,5), (6)
