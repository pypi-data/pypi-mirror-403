    **Purchase Status Lifecycle.** `PENDING` (initial) → `SUCCESS` (after code

    via admin action.

    **Important.** Status is immutable once set to `SUCCESS`, `ERROR`, or `REFUND`.

    - `PENDING` - code not requested.
    - `SUCCESS` - code ready.
    - `ERROR` - provider failed.
    - `REFUND` - money returned.
