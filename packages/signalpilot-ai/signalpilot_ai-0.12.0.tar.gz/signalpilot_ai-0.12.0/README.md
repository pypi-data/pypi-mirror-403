## **What is SignalPilot Agent?**

**SignalPilot is an AI-native notebook assistant that supercharges your existing Jupyter workflows.**

Built by leading AI and quant researchers from YC, Harvard, MIT, and Goldman Sachs, SignalPilot brings real-time, context-aware assistance directly into JupyterLab.

Use natural language to clean data, write analysis code, debug errors, explore dataframes, and build models—faster and with fewer mistakes.

**No hallucinated code. No context switching. Just faster insights.**

## **Why Use SignalPilot Agent in Jupyter?**

Whether you’re a quant, data scientist, or analyst living in notebooks, SignalPilot helps you:

✅ Clean and transform messy data in seconds

✅ Visualize trends, rollups, and anomalies from a prompt

✅ Connect your custom databases in one click and easily explore from notebooks 

✅ Generate *runnable* Python or SQL that fits your current cell + variable context

✅ Auto-detect schema changes and debug downstream errors

✅ Stay private: run entirely *local-first* or in your own secure VPC

✅ Extend JupyterLab without changing how you work

---

## **Perfect For:**

- Data scientists cleaning huge CSVs
- Quant researchers testing ML pipelines
- Product and analytics teams tired of building dashboards and flaky notebooks
- Anyone tired of LLM tools that break their code
