    """
    Mirror points near boundaries to handle edge effects in Ripley's K analysis.
    Works with actual coordinate positions, not spatial grid placement.
    
    Parameters:
    points_array: numpy array of shape (n, 3) with [z, y, x] coordinates (already scaled)
    bounds: tuple of (min_coords, max_coords) where each is array - can be 2D or 3D
    max_r: maximum search radius (determines mirroring distance)
    dim: dimension (2 or 3) - affects which coordinates are used
    
    Returns:
    numpy array with original points plus mirrored points

    Can be used to label vertices (where multiple branches connect) a binary image. Labelled output will be saved to the active directory if none is specified. Note this works better on already thin filaments and may over-divide larger trunkish objects.
    Note that this can be used in tandem with an edge segmentation to create an image containing 'pseudo-nodes', meaning we can make a network out of just a single edge file.
    :param array: (Mandatory, string or ndarray) - If string, a path to a tif file to label. Note that the ndarray alternative is for internal use mainly and will not save its output.
    :param peaks: (Optional, Val = 0; int) - An optional value on what size of peaks to keep. A peak is peak in the histogram of volumes of objects in the array. The number of peaks that will be kept start on the left (low volume). The point of this is to remove large, erroneous vertices that may result from skeletonizing large objects. 
    :param branch_removal: (Optional, Val = 0; int) - An optional into to specify what size of pixels to remove branches. Use this if the skeleton is branchy and you want to remove the branches from the larger filaments. Large objects tend to produce branches when skeletonized. Enabling this in the right situations will make the output significantly more accurate.
    :param comp_dil: (Optional, Val = 0; int) - An optional value to merge nearby vertices. This algorithm may be prone to leaving a few, disconnected vertices next to each other that otherwise represent the same branch point but will confound the network a bit. These can be combined into a single object by dilation. Note this dilation will be applied post downsample, so take that into account when assigning a value, as the value will not take resampling into account and will just apply as is on a downsample.
    :param max_vol: (Optional, Val = 0, int) - An optional value of the largest volume of an object to keep in the vertices output. Will only filter if > 0.
    :param directory: (Optional - Val = None; string) - A filepath to save outputs.

    Can be used to 3D watershed a binary image. Watershedding attempts to use an algorithm to split touching objects into seperate labelled components. Labelled output will be saved to the active directory if none is specified.
    This watershed algo essentially uses the distance transform to decide where peaks are and then after thresholding out the non-peaks, uses the peaks as labelling kernels for a smart label. It runs semi slow without GPU accel since it requires two dts to be computed.
    :param image: (Mandatory, string or ndarray). - If string, a path to a binary .tif to watershed, or an ndarray containing the same.
    :param directory: (Optional - Val = None; string) - A filepath to save outputs.
    :param proportion: (Optional - Val = 0.1; float) - A zero to one value representing the proportion of watershed 'peaks' that are kept around for splitting objects. Essentially,
    making this value smaller makes the watershed break more things, however making it too small will result in some unusual failures where small objects all get the same label. 
    :param GPU: (Optional - Val = True; boolean). If True, GPU will be used to watershed. Please note this will result in internal downsampling most likely, and overall be very fast.
    However, this downsampling may kick small nodes out of the image. Do not use the GPU to watershed if your GPU wants to downsample beyond the size of the smallest node that you
    want to keep in the output. Set to False to use the CPU (no downsampling). Note using the GPU + downsample may take around a minute to process arrays that are a few GB while the CPU may take an hour or so.
    :param smallest_rad: (Optional - Val = None; int). The size (in voxels) of the radius of the smallest object you want to seperate with watershedding. Note that the
    'proportion' param is the affector of watershed outputs but itself may be confusing to tinker with. By inputting a smallest_rad, the algo will instead compute a custom proportion
    to use for your data.

        Method to calculate and save to mem all properties of a Network_3D object. In general, after initializing a Network_3D object, this method should be called on the node and edge masks that will be used to calculate the network.
        :param nodes: (Mandatory; String or ndarray). Filepath to segmented nodes mask or a numpy array containing the same.
        :param edges: (Mandatory; String or ndarray). Filepath to segmented edges mask or a numpy array containing the same.
        :param xy_scale: (Optional - Val = 1; Float). Pixel scaling to convert pixel sizes to some real value (such as microns).
        :param z_scale: (Optional - Val = 1; Float). Voxel depth to convert voxel depths to some real value (such as microns).
        :param down_factor: (Optional - Val = None; int). Optional factor to downsample nodes and edges during centroid calculation to increase speed. Note this only applies to centroid calculation and that the outputed centroids will correspond to the full-sized file. On-line general downsampling is not supported by this method and should be computed on masks before inputting them.
        :param search: (Optional - Val = None; int). Amount nodes should expand outward to search for connections. Note this value corresponds one-to-one with voxels unless voxel_scaling has been set, in which case it will correspond to whatever value the nodes array is measured in (microns, for example). If unset, only directly overlapping nodes and edges will find connections.
        :param diledge: (Optional - Val = None; int). Amount to dilate edges, to account for imaging and segmentation artifacts that have brokenup edges. Any edge masks that are within half the value of the 'diledge' param will become connected. Ideally edges should not have gaps,
        so some amount of dilation is recommended if there are any, but not so much to create overconnectivity. This is a value that needs to be tuned by the user.
        :param inners: (Optional - Val = True; boolean). Will use inner edges if True, will not if False. Inner edges are parts of the edge mask that exist within search regions. If search regions overlap, 
        any edges that exist within the overlap will only assert connectivity if 'inners' is True.
        If True, an extra processing step is used to sort the correct connectivity amongst these search_regions. Can only be computed when search_regions property is set.
        :param remove_trunk: (Optional - Val = 0; int). Amount of times to remove the 'Trunk' from the edges. A trunk in this case is the largest (by vol) edge object remaining after nodes have broken up the edges.
        Any 'Trunks' removed will be absent for connection calculations.
        :param ignore_search_region: (Optional - Val = False; boolean). If False, will use primary algorithm (with search_regions property) to find connections. If True, will use secondary algorithm (with nodes) to find connections.
        :param other_nodes: (Optional - Val = None; string). Path to either a tif file or a directory containing only additional node files to merge with the original nodes, assuming multiple 'types' of nodes need comparing. Node identities will be retained.
        :param label_nodes: (Optional - Val = True; boolean). If True, all discrete objects in the node param (and all those contained in the optional other_nodes param) will be assigned a label. If files a prelabelled, set this to False to avoid labelling.
        :param directory: (Optional - Val = None; string). Path to a directory to save to hard mem all Network_3D properties. If not set, these values will be saved to the active directory.
        :param GPU: (Optional - Val = True; boolean). Will use GPU if avaialble for calculating the search_region step (including necessary downsampling for GPU RAM). Set to False to use CPU with no downsample. Note this only affects the search_region step.
        :param fast_dil: (Optional - Val = False, boolean) - A boolean that when True will utilize faster psuedo3d kernel dilation but when false will use slower dt-based dilation.
        :param skeletonize: (Optional - Val = False, boolean) - A boolean of whether to skeletonize the edges when using them.
