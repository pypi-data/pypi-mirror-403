All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.5] - 2026-01-29

### Removed

- **Blacklist Management UI**: Removed "Arricchisci DB" (Enrich Database) button from blacklist management interface
  - Button allowed enriching local blocked emails database with information from Brevo blacklist
  - Functionality removed as it's no longer needed in the current workflow
  - Simplified UI by removing unnecessary operation button
  - Removed `enrichDatabase()` function and related state management from Vue.js component

### Technical Details

- Removed enrichment button from ListAllTab component template
- Removed `enriching` reactive state reference
- Removed `enrichDatabase` async function
- Cleaned up component return statement to remove unused references

## [0.2.4] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- **Internationalization**: Fixed untranslated KPI filter labels in Message Emails view
  - Status filter buttons (Sent, Delivered, Opened, Clicked, Bounced, Blocked) now properly use i18n translation keys
  - Labels were previously hardcoded in English, preventing proper localization
  - All KPI filter labels now use `$t()` function for dynamic translation based on user locale
  - Improves user experience for non-English speakers

### Technical Details

- Updated Vue.js SPA template to replace hardcoded English labels with i18n keys
- Modified KPI filter button rendering in Message Emails view component
- Maintains existing functionality while enabling proper multilingual support

## [0.2.3] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed

- **Webhook Authentication**: Fixed critical bug where webhook validation was looking for non-existent `X-Brevo-Signature` HMAC header
  - Brevo actually sends authentication as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
  - Changed webhook authentication from HMAC signature validation to Bearer token validation
  - This bug caused all webhook requests to fail with "Invalid webhook signature" warnings since v0.1.0
  - Webhook now correctly validates the Bearer token from `Authorization` header against `WEBHOOK_SECRET` setting
- **Sender Email Extraction**: Enhanced sender field extraction to support `sender_email` field in webhook payloads
  - Webhook now checks `sender`, `from`, and `sender_email` fields (in that order) to extract sender information
  - Eliminates "no sender information" warnings for events that include `sender_email` field

### Technical Details

- Removed unused `hmac` and `hashlib` imports from webhook handler
- Simplified authentication logic: direct string comparison of Bearer token instead of HMAC computation
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing `WEBHOOK_SECRET` configuration

## [0.2.2] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed

- **Missing Migration File**: Included Django migration file (`0005_brevoemail_sender_email.py`) that was inadvertently omitted from v0.2.1 package
  - Users who installed v0.2.1 encountered errors when running `python manage.py migrate brevo_analytics`
  - Migration creates the `sender_email` field required for sender validation introduced in v0.2.1
  - This hotfix completes the security patch from v0.2.1 by providing the required database schema changes

### Migration Note

**For users who installed v0.2.1:**
- Upgrade immediately to v0.2.2 to get the missing migration file
- Run `python manage.py migrate brevo_analytics` after upgrading
- No other changes required - all configuration from v0.2.1 remains valid

**For new installations:**
- This version includes all migrations needed for the sender validation security feature
- Follow the standard installation and configuration steps from the README

### Technical Details

- Added migration file: `brevo_analytics/migrations/0005_brevoemail_sender_email.py`
- Creates `sender_email` field on `BrevoEmail` model (nullable CharField, indexed)
- No code changes - purely a packaging fix to include the migration in the distribution

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-27

### Security

**CRITICAL SECURITY PATCH - IMMEDIATE UPDATE REQUIRED**

- **Multi-Tenant Data Contamination Vulnerability**: Fixed critical security flaw where webhook accepted events from ANY sender on shared Brevo account
  - **Impact**: Before this fix, webhook processed events from all clients sharing the same Brevo account, mixing data from different organizations into the same database
  - **Severity**: CRITICAL - Potential for unauthorized access to analytics data from other tenants
  - **Resolution**: Webhook now validates sender email against `ALLOWED_SENDERS` configuration before processing any events

### Added

- **Sender Email Tracking**: New `sender_email` field in `BrevoEmail` model
  - Captures sender address from every Brevo event
  - Enables sender-based filtering and data isolation
  - Indexed for fast queries
- **Sender Validation**: Automatic sender verification in webhook processing
  - Only events from senders in `BREVO_ANALYTICS['ALLOWED_SENDERS']` are processed
  - Unauthorized sender events are logged and rejected
  - Prevents data contamination from other tenants on shared Brevo accounts
- **ORM-Level Sender Filtering**: Enhanced `BrevoEmailManager` with automatic sender filtering
  - All database queries automatically exclude unauthorized senders
  - Transparent filtering - no code changes required in existing applications
  - Works with all Django ORM methods (filter, exclude, annotate, etc.)
- **Management Command**: `verify_senders` - Identify potentially contaminated data
  - Scans database for emails from unauthorized senders
  - Reports statistics on data contamination
  - Supports dry-run mode to preview issues before cleanup
  - Helps assess impact of vulnerability on existing installations

### Changed

- **Database Schema**: Added `sender_email` field to `BrevoEmail` model
  - **Migration Required**: Run `python manage.py migrate brevo_analytics` after update
  - Nullable field for backward compatibility with existing data
  - Future webhook events will populate this field automatically
- **Configuration Requirement**: `ALLOWED_SENDERS` setting is now MANDATORY
  - Must be configured in `BREVO_ANALYTICS['ALLOWED_SENDERS']` setting
  - List of authorized sender email addresses for your organization
  - Events from unlisted senders will be rejected
  - Example: `ALLOWED_SENDERS = ['noreply@example.com', 'alerts@example.com']`
- **Webhook Behavior**: Enhanced event processing with sender validation
  - Extracts sender email from `from` or `sender` webhook fields
  - Validates against ALLOWED_SENDERS before database operations
  - Logs rejection of unauthorized sender events for audit trail

### Migration Guide

**CRITICAL - Action Required for All Installations:**

1. **Update Package**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade django-brevo-analytics==0.2.1
   ```

2. **Configure ALLOWED_SENDERS** in Django settings:
   ```python
   BREVO_ANALYTICS = {
       'WEBHOOK_SECRET': 'your-webhook-secret',
       'CLIENT_UID': 'your-client-uuid',
       'ALLOWED_SENDERS': [
           'noreply@yourcompany.com',
           'alerts@yourcompany.com',
           # Add all legitimate sender addresses for your organization
       ],
   }
   ```

3. **Run Database Migration**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate brevo_analytics
   ```

4. **Verify Existing Data** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # Check for potentially contaminated data
   python manage.py verify_senders
   ```

5. **Re-import Historical Data** (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Clear and reimport to populate sender_email field
   python manage.py import_brevo_logs /path/to/logs.csv --clear
   ```

### Impact Assessment

**Before Fix:**
- Webhook accepted events from ANY sender on shared Brevo account
- Analytics data could include emails from other organizations
- No sender validation or isolation between tenants
- Potential for data leakage in multi-tenant Brevo accounts

**After Fix:**
- Only authorized senders (configured in ALLOWED_SENDERS) are processed
- Automatic sender validation on all webhook events
- ORM-level filtering ensures unauthorized data never appears in queries
- Complete data isolation for multi-tenant environments

**Affected Versions**: All versions prior to 0.2.1

**Recommended Action**: Immediate update for all installations, especially those on shared Brevo accounts

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **Internal Domain Filtering System**: Comprehensive three-level filtering to exclude internal/test emails from analytics
  - Configure excluded domains via `BREVO_ANALYTICS['EXCLUDED_RECIPIENT_DOMAINS']` setting
  - Automatic filtering during CSV import prevents internal emails from entering the database
  - Real-time webhook filtering blocks internal domain events before processing
  - Model-level query filtering ensures internal emails never appear in analytics views or API responses
- **Management Command**: `clean_internal_emails` - Remove existing internal emails from database
  - Supports dry-run mode to preview deletions before applying
  - Automatically recalculates message statistics after cleanup
  - Useful for cleaning up data imported before domain filtering was configured
- **Management Command**: `recalculate_stats` - Recalculate statistics for all messages
  - Rebuild denormalized statistics from event data
  - Useful after data cleanup or manual database changes
  - Ensures dashboard metrics remain accurate

### Fixed
- **Statistics Accuracy**: Fixed critical bug in `BrevoMessage.update_stats()` that was counting all emails in the database instead of only emails with 'sent' events for the specific message
  - Delivery rate, open rate, and click rate calculations now correctly reflect actual sent emails
  - Prevents inflated or incorrect percentage metrics in dashboard
- **Webhook Event Processing**: Webhook now correctly ignores events that arrive without a prior 'sent' event in the database
  - Prevents orphaned events from creating incomplete email records
  - Ensures all tracked emails have complete event history starting from 'sent'

### Changed
- **Email Model**: Added custom `BrevoEmailQuerySet` and `BrevoEmailManager` for automatic domain filtering at the ORM level
  - All queries automatically exclude internal domains without manual filtering
  - Transparent to existing code - filtering happens automatically
- **Import Command**: Enhanced `import_brevo_logs` to filter internal domains during CSV processing
  - Reduces database size by excluding test/internal emails from the start
  - Improves import performance by skipping unnecessary records
- **Webhook Processing**: Updated webhook handler to filter internal domains in real-time
  - Prevents test emails from affecting production analytics
  - Reduces database writes for non-production events

### Technical Details
- All changes are backward compatible with existing configurations
- Domain filtering is optional - package works without `EXCLUDED_RECIPIENT_DOMAINS` configuration
- Custom manager ensures filtering works with all Django ORM query methods (filter, exclude, annotate, etc.)
- Statistics recalculation is automatically triggered after cleanup operations
