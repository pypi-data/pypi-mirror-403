A Python library for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities in LLM applications.

## 📦 Installation

This package is part of the `fabricatio` monorepo and can be installed as an optional dependency using either pip or uv:

```bash
pip install fabricatio[rag]
# or
uv pip install fabricatio[rag]
```

For a full installation that includes this package and all other components of `fabricatio`:

```bash
pip install fabricatio[full]
# or
uv pip install fabricatio[full]
```

## 🔍 Overview

Provides tools for:

- Document embedding and vector storage using Milvus
  This feature uses the Milvus vector database to store document embeddings. Document embeddings are numerical
  representations of text documents that capture their semantic meaning. The library first converts text documents into
  embeddings using appropriate embedding models. These embeddings are then stored in Milvus, which provides efficient
  storage and retrieval capabilities. For example, it can handle large - scale document collections and perform fast
  similarity searches.
- Semantic search and context retrieval
  The semantic search and context retrieval feature allows users to search for relevant documents based on the meaning
  of their queries. It uses the stored document embeddings in Milvus to find documents that are semantically similar to
  the query. This is more powerful than traditional keyword - based search as it can understand the intent behind the
  query. For example, if a user searches for "effects of pollution on wildlife", it can retrieve documents that discuss
  related concepts even if the exact keywords are not present.
- Integration with TEI (Text Embeddings Inference) services
  The integration with TEI services enables the generation of text embeddings. TEI services provide pre - trained models
  that can convert text into embeddings. The library can send text data to the TEI service and receive the corresponding
  embeddings. This allows for the use of state - of - the - art embedding models without having to manage the model
  training and inference process locally.
- Database injection workflows
  The database injection workflows are responsible for inserting new documents into the Milvus database. It takes care
  of the process of converting the documents into embeddings, and then inserting them into the appropriate collections
  in Milvus. This includes handling tasks such as collection creation, data indexing, and error handling.
- Asynchronous RAG execution patterns
  The asynchronous RAG execution patterns allow the library to perform multiple RAG tasks concurrently without blocking
  the main thread. This is useful for improving the performance and responsiveness of the application. For example, it
  can handle multiple user queries simultaneously, reducing the overall response time.

Built on top of Fabricatio's agent framework with support for asynchronous execution and Rust extensions.

## 🧩 Usage Example

```python
from fabricatio_rag.capabilities.rag import MilvusRAG
# The `RAG` class is the core component of the library. It provides methods for performing retrieval - augmented generation tasks. It interacts with the Milvus database for document retrieval and uses the generated embeddings to augment the generation process.
from fabricatio_rag.models.milvus import MilvusDataBase


# The `MilvusDataBase` class represents the connection to the Milvus vector database. It provides methods for creating collections, inserting documents, and performing searches. It abstracts the low - level details of working with Milvus, making it easier to use in the application.


async def search_knowledge():
    # Initialize database connection
    db = MilvusDataBase(collection_name="science_papers")
    # This line initializes a connection to the Milvus database with a specific collection named "science_papers". The collection is where the document embeddings will be stored and retrieved from.

    # Initialize RAG capability
    rag = MilvusRAG(db)
    # This line creates an instance of the `RAG` class, passing in the `MilvusDataBase` object. This allows the `RAG` class to interact with the Milvus database for document retrieval.

    # Search for relevant information
    results = await rag.retrieve("climate change impact on coral reefs", limit=3)
    # The `retrieve` method of the `RAG` class is used to perform a semantic search in the Milvus database. It takes a query string and a limit as parameters. In this example, it searches for documents related to "climate change impact on coral reefs" and returns the top 3 relevant documents.

    print("Top 3 relevant documents:")
    for result in results:
        print(f"- {result['title']}")
        print(f"  Relevance: {result['score']:.2f}")
        print(f"  Snippet: {result['text'][:150]}...")
```
