"""
Core protocols for the Rendering system.

This module defines the essential contracts (interfaces) that decouple the
"What" (Renderable objects) from the "How" (The Renderer backend).

By adhering to these protocols:
1.  Game entities don't need to know if they are being drawn by Pygame or OpenGL.
2.  The Renderer doesn't need to know what an "Enemy" or "Player" is; it just
    knows it received something `Renderable`.
