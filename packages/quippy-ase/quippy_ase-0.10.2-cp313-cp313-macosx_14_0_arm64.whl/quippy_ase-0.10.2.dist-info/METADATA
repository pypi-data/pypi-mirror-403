The aim of quippy is to make all the functions, subroutines and types
defined in QUIP available from Python scripts.

Quick-start:
 # First, build the main QUIP libraries
 $ cd ${QUIP_ROOT}
 $ meson setup builddir
 $ meson compile -C builddir

 # Then build and install quippy
 $ cd quippy
 $ meson setup builddir
 $ meson compile -C builddir
 $ meson install -C builddir

Alternatively, you can install quippy directly with pip:
 $ cd quippy
 $ pip install .

For more details, see documentation in doc/ subdirectory, which is in
reStructuredText format.
