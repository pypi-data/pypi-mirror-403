Constraints:
- Every atomic action MUST be executed via a single drive(...) call.
- Each drive(...) call must directly contain the atomic action(s); do NOT define actions separately and then pass them into drive.
- For single-arm execution: specify the active arm’s action and explicitly set the unused arm to None within the same drive(...) call.
- For dual-arm execution: both arms’ actions MUST be specified within the same drive(...) call.
- Use exactly one drive(...) call per step; no exceptions.
- Output MUST be executable Python code only: no explanations, no comments, no markdown, and no extra text.
