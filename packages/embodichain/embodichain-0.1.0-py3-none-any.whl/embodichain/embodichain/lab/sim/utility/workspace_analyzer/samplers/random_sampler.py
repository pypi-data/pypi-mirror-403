    This sampler generates samples uniformly at random within the specified bounds.
    It's simple and fast, but doesn't guarantee uniform coverage. Samples may
    cluster in some regions while leaving other regions sparse.

    Advantages:
        - Fast and simple
        - No assumptions about the space
        - Works well for any number of dimensions

    Disadvantages:
        - Uneven coverage (clusters and gaps)
        - Slower convergence than quasi-random methods
        - May miss important regions
