    SPLIT_CHUNKED_ROUTE: Final = DocString(

Split route sheet into n workbooks with sheets by driver.

Sheets by driver allows splitting routes by driver on Circuit upload.
Multiple workbooks allows team to split the uploads among members, so one person
doesn't have to upload all routes.
This process follows the "chunking" process in the route generation, where routes
are split into smaller "chunks" by driver (i.e., each stop is labeled with a driver).

Reads a route spreadsheet at `input_path`.
Writes `n_books` Excel workbooks with each sheet containing the stops for a single driver.
Writes adjacent to the original workbook unless `output_dir` specified. If specified, will
create the directory if it doesn't exist.

.. note::

    Renames "Box Type" column name to "Product Type", per Circuit API.

.. note::

    The date passed sets the date in the sheet names of the output workbooks, and that
    date in the sheet name is used for the manifest date field in later functions that
    make the manifests: :py:func:`bfb_delivery.api.public.format_combined_routes` and
