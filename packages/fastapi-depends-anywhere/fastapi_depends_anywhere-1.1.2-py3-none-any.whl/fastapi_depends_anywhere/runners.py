    """Decorate an async function to run synchronously with FastAPI dependencies.

    This decorator combines lifecycle management, dependency resolution, and
    sync execution into a single decorator. It's ideal for scripts and CLI
    commands that need to use FastAPI dependencies.

    Requires the `asyncer` package to be installed:
        pip install fastapi-depends-anywhere[asyncer]

    Can be used as `@sync_with_fastapi_depends` or `@sync_with_fastapi_depends(app=app)`.

    Args:
        func: The async function to decorate.
        app: Optional FastAPI app instance. If not provided, uses the globally
            configured app.

    Returns:
        A synchronous wrapper function that:
        1. Runs FastAPI's startup lifecycle
        2. Resolves all FastAPI dependencies
        3. Executes the function
        4. Cleans up dependencies
        5. Runs FastAPI's shutdown lifecycle

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If no app is configured or provided.
        ImportError: If asyncer is not installed.

    Example:
        ```python
        @sync_with_fastapi_depends
        async def run_report(*, db: Database = Depends(get_db)) -> None:
            results = await db.fetch_all("SELECT * FROM reports")
            for row in results:
                print(row)

        # In a CLI script - no await needed!
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            run_report()
