🏎️ An all-in-one, flexible Python library for building powerful LLM workflows and AI apps. 🏎️

Draive gives you everything you need to turn large language models into production-ready software:
agents, structured workflows, tool use, instruction refinement, guardrails, observability, and
seamless multi-model integration — all in one clean, composable package.

If you've ever felt like you’re stitching together glue code and hoping for the best — Draive is
what you wish you'd started with!

## 🚀 Quick start

Here’s what a simple Draive setup looks like:

```python
from draive import ctx, TextGeneration, tool
from draive.openai import OpenAI, OpenAIResponsesConfig

@tool # simply annotate a function as a tool
async def current_time(location: str) -> str:
    return f"Time in {location} is 9:53:22"

async with  ctx.scope( # create execution context
    "example", # give it a name
    OpenAIResponsesConfig(model="gpt-4o-mini"), # prepare configuration
    disposables=(OpenAI(),), # define resources and service clients available
):
    result: str = await TextGeneration.generate( # choose a right generation abstraction
        instructions="You are a helpful assistant", # provide clear instructions
        input="What is the time in Kraków?", # give it some input (including multimodal)
        tools=[current_time], # and select any tools you like
    )

    print(result) # to finally get the result!
    # output: The current time in Kraków is 9:53:22.
```

Read the [Draive Documentation](https://miquido.github.io/draive/) for all required knowledge.

repository.

## ❓ What is Draive good for

Draive is built for developers who want clarity, flexibility, and control when working with LLMs.

Whether you’re building an autonomous agent, automating data flow, extracting information from
documents, handling audio or images — Draive has your back.

### What you can do with Draive

- **🔁 Start with evaluation** - make sure your app behaves as expected, right from the start
- **🛠 Turn any Python function into a tool** that LLMs can call
- **🔄 Switch between providers** like OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or Mistral in seconds
- **🧱 Design structured workflows** with reusable stages
- **🛡 Enforce output quality using guardrails** including moderation and runtime evaluation
- **📊 Monitor with ease** - plug into any OpenTelemetry-compatible services
- **⚙️ Control your context** - use on-the-fly LLM context modifications for best results

### Why you'll like it

- **Instruction Optimization**: Draive gives you clean ways to write and refine prompts, including
    metaprompts, instruction helpers, and optimizers. You can go from raw prompt text to a reusable,
    structured config in no time.
- **Composable Workflows**: Build modular flows using Stages and Tools. Every piece is reusable,
    testable, and fits together seamlessly.
- **Tooling = Just Python**: Define a tool by writing a function. Annotate it. That’s it. Draive
    handles the rest — serialization, context, and integration with LLMs.
- **Structured Outputs** - use Python classes for JSON outputs and flexible multimodal XML parser
    for custom results transformations.
- **Telemetry + Evaluators**: Draive logs everything you care about: timing, output shape, tool
    usage, error cases. Evaluators let you benchmark or regression-test LLM behavior like a normal
    part of your CI.
- **Model-Agnostic by Design**: Built-in support for most major providers.

## 🖥️ Install

With pip:

```bash
pip install draive
```

```bash
pip install 'draive[anthropic]'
```

- Gemini:
