           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

**VieNeu-TTS** is an advanced on-device Vietnamese Text-to-Speech (TTS) model with **instant voice cloning**.

> [!TIP]
> **Voice Cloning:** All model variants (including GGUF) support instant voice cloning with just **3-5 seconds** of reference audio.

This project features two core architectures trained on the [VieNeu-TTS-1000h](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pnnbao-ump/VieNeu-TTS-1000h) dataset:
- **VieNeu-TTS (0.5B):** An enhanced model fine-tuned from the NeuTTS Air architecture for maximum stability.
- **VieNeu-TTS-0.3B:** A specialized model **trained from scratch** using the VieNeu-TTS-1000h dataset, delivering 2x faster inference and ultra-low latency.

These represent a significant upgrade from the previous VieNeu-TTS-140h with the following improvements:
- **Enhanced pronunciation**: More accurate and stable Vietnamese pronunciation
- **Code-switching support**: Seamless transitions between Vietnamese and English
- **Better voice cloning**: Higher fidelity and speaker consistency
- **Real-time synthesis**: 24 kHz waveform generation on CPU or GPU
- **Multiple model formats**: Support for PyTorch, GGUF Q4/Q8 (CPU optimized), and ONNX codec

VieNeu-TTS delivers production-ready speech synthesis fully offline.

## 📦 1. Using the Python SDK (vieneu) <a name="sdk"></a>

Integrate VieNeu-TTS into your own software projects.

### Quick Install
```bash
# Windows (Avoid llama-cpp build errors)
pip install vieneu --extra-index-url https://pnnbao97.github.io/llama-cpp-python-v0.3.16/cpu/

# Linux / MacOS
pip install vieneu
```

### Quick Start (main.py)
```python
from vieneu import Vieneu
import os

# Initialization
tts = Vieneu()

# Standard synthesis (uses default voice)
text = "Xin chào, tôi là VieNeu. Tôi có thể giúp bạn đọc sách, làm chatbot thời gian thực, hoặc thậm chí clone giọng nói của bạn."
audio = tts.infer(text=text)
tts.save(audio, "standard_output.wav")
print("💾 Saved synthesis to: standard_output.wav")
```

*For full implementation details, see [main.py](main.py).*

---

## 🐳 2. Docker & Remote Server <a name="docker-remote"></a>

Deploy VieNeu-TTS as a high-performance API Server (powered by LMDeploy) with a single command.

### 1. Run with Docker (Recommended)

**Requirement**: [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) is required for GPU support.

**Start the Server with a Public Tunnel (No port forwarding needed):**
```bash
docker run --gpus all -p 23333:23333 pnnbao/vieneu-tts:serve --tunnel
```

*   **Default**: The server loads the `VieNeu-TTS` model for maximum quality.
*   **Tunneling**: The Docker image includes a built-in `bore` tunnel. Check the container logs to find your public address (e.g., `bore.pub:31631`).

### 2. Using the SDK (Remote Mode)

Once the server is running, you can connect from anywhere (Colab, Web Apps, etc.) without loading heavy models locally:

```python
from vieneu import Vieneu
import os

# Configuration
REMOTE_API_BASE = 'http://your-server-ip:23333/v1'  # Or bore tunnel URL
REMOTE_MODEL_ID = "pnnbao-ump/VieNeu-TTS"

# Initialization (LIGHTWEIGHT - only loads small codec locally)
tts = Vieneu(mode='remote', api_base=REMOTE_API_BASE, model_name=REMOTE_MODEL_ID)
os.makedirs("outputs", exist_ok=True)

# List remote voices
available_voices = tts.list_preset_voices()
for desc, name in available_voices:
    print(f"   - {desc} (ID: {name})")

# Use specific voice (dynamically select second voice)
if available_voices:
    _, my_voice_id = available_voices[1]
    voice_data = tts.get_preset_voice(my_voice_id)
    audio_spec = tts.infer(text="Chào bạn, tôi đang nói bằng giọng của bác sĩ Tuyên.", voice=voice_data)
    tts.save(audio_spec, f"outputs/remote_{my_voice_id}.wav")
    print(f"💾 Saved synthesis to: outputs/remote_{my_voice_id}.wav")

# Standard synthesis (uses default voice)
text_input = "Chế độ remote giúp tích hợp VieNeu vào ứng dụng Web hoặc App cực nhanh mà không cần GPU tại máy khách."
audio = tts.infer(text=text_input)
tts.save(audio, "outputs/remote_output.wav")
print("💾 Saved remote synthesis to: outputs/remote_output.wav")

# Zero-shot voice cloning (encodes audio locally, sends codes to server)
if os.path.exists("examples/audio_ref/example_ngoc_huyen.wav"):
    cloned_audio = tts.infer(
        text="Đây là giọng nói được clone và xử lý thông qua VieNeu Server.",
        ref_audio="examples/audio_ref/example_ngoc_huyen.wav",
        ref_text="Tác phẩm dự thi bảo đảm tính khoa học, tính đảng, tính chiến đấu, tính định hướng."
    )
    tts.save(cloned_audio, "outputs/remote_cloned_output.wav")
    print("💾 Saved remote cloned voice to: outputs/remote_cloned_output.wav")
```

*For full implementation details, see: [main_remote.py](main_remote.py)*

### Voice Preset Specification (v1.0)
VieNeu-TTS uses the official `vieneu.voice.presets` specification to define reusable voice assets.
Only `voices.json` files following this spec are guaranteed to be compatible with VieNeu-TTS SDK ≥ v1.x.

### 3. Advanced Configuration

Customize the server to run specific versions or your own fine-tuned models.

**Run the 0.3B Model (Faster):**
```bash
docker run --gpus all pnnbao/vieneu-tts:serve --model pnnbao-ump/VieNeu-TTS-0.3B --tunnel
```

**Serve a Local Fine-tuned Model:**
If you have merged a LoRA adapter, mount your output directory to the container:
```bash
# Linux / macOS
docker run --gpus all \
  -v $(pwd)/finetune/output:/workspace/models \
  pnnbao/vieneu-tts:serve \
  --model /workspace/models/merged_model --tunnel
```

*For full implementation details, see: [main_remote.py](main_remote.py)*
