        GOVERNING LAW AND FORUM.
        
        This  agreement  is  governed  by  the  laws  of  the  State  of  Nevada  (without regard to 
        conflicts  of  law principles) for any dispute between the parties or relating in any way to 
        the  subject  matter  of  this  agreement.  Any suit or legal proceeding must be exclusively 
        brought  in  the  federal  or  state  courts  for Washoe County, Nevada, and User submits to 
        this  personal  jurisdiction  and  venue.  Nothing  in this  agreement prevents either party 
        from  seeking  injunctive  relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. The prevailing party 
        in any litigation is entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs from the other party.
        
        
        OTHER TERMS.
        
        Entire Agreement and Changes. This agreement constitutes the entire 
        agreement between the parties and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous 
        negotiations or agreements, whether oral or written, related to this subject matter. 
        User is not relying on any representation concerning this subject matter, oral or 
        written, not included in this agreement. No representation, promise, or inducement 
        not included in this agreement is binding. No modification or waiver of any term of 
        this agreement is effective unless both parties sign it.
        
        No Assignment. Neither party may assign or transfer this agreement to a third 
        party, nor delegate any duty, except that the agreement may be assigned, without 
        the consent of the other party, (i) as part of a merger or sale of all or substantially 
        all a party's businesses or assets, of User, and (ii) in the case of AMV at any time 
        to any third party.
        
        Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors with respect 
        to each other, and neither party is an agent, employee, or partner of the other 
        party or the other party's affiliates.
        
        Enforceability and Force Majeure. If any term of this agreement is invalid or 
        unenforceable, the other terms remain in effect. Neither party is liable for its non-
        performance due to events beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited 
        to natural weather events and disasters, labor disruptions, and disruptions in the 
        supply of utilities.
        
        Money Damages Insufficient. Any breach by a party of this agreement or 
        violation of the other party’s intellectual property rights could cause irreparable 
        injury or harm to the other party. The other party may seek a court order to stop 
        any breach or avoid any future breach of this agreement.
        
        Survival of Terms. All provisions of this agreement regarding payment, 
        confidentiality, indemnification, limitations of liability, proprietary rights and such 
        other provisions that by fair implication require performance beyond the term of 
        this agreement must survive expiration or termination of this agreement until fully 
        performed or otherwise are inapplicable. The UN Convention on Contracts for the 
        International Sale of Goods does not apply.
        
        Compliance Audit. No more than once in any 12-month period and upon at least 
        30 days’ advance notice, AMV (or its representative) may audit User’s usage of the 
        Software at any User facility. User will cooperate with such audit. User agrees to pay 
        within 30 days of written notification any fees applicable to User’s use of the 
        Software in excess of the license.
        
        Export Compliance. The Software and Confidential Information may be subject to 
        export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. Each party 
        represents that it is not named on any U.S. government denied-party list. Neither 
        party will permit its personnel or representatives to access any Software in a U.S.-
        embargoed country or in violation of any applicable export law or regulation.
        
        U.S. Government Restricted Rights. If User is a United States government 
        agency or acquired the license to the Software hereunder pursuant to a 
        government contract or with government funds, then as defined in FAR §2.101, 
        DFAR §252.227-7014(a)(1), and DFAR §252.227-7014(a)(5), or otherwise, all 
        Software provided in connection with this agreement are “commercial items,” 
        “commercial computer software,” or “commercial computer software 
        documentation.” Consistent with DFAR §227.7202 and FAR §12.212, any use, 
        modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, disclosure, or 
        distribution by or for the United States government is governed solely by the 
        terms of this agreement and is prohibited except to the extent permitted by the 
        terms of this agreement.
        
        Open Source Software Licenses. The Software may contain embedded open source 
        software components, which are provided as part of the Software and for 
        which additional terms may be included in the technical documentation.
        
        Feedback. If User provides feedback or suggestions about the Software, then AMV 
        (and those it allows to use its technology) may use such information without 
        obligation to User.

# MeshLib: An SDK to Supercharge Your 3D Data Processing Efficiency

Official Website: [**https://meshlib.io**](https://meshlib.io/) 

The MeshLib SDK is an open-source library that provides advanced algorithms for 3D data processing. It assists developers and engineers in achieving precise results while delivering significant resource savings. Whether you are working on 3D printing, scanning, inspection, automation, robotics, scientific visualization, or medical devices, our 3D data processing library is ideally suited to meet your needs thanks to its potent capabilities and broad applicability.
![MeshLib_SDK_Mesh_Processing_Library](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a65dc95f-675d-4fb8-ac17-6857c9a91554)

**Flexible Integration.** Use our toolkit as a standalone engine with UI components, or integrate selected algorithms into existing applications with minimal dependencies.

## What We Offer

We provide a robust foundation for 3D data processing, supporting all essential formats like point clouds, meshes, and volumes continuously generated by modern sensors. Our powerful half-edge data structure ensures manifold compliance for precise, reliable mesh representation. Plus, our repository includes clear code samples to help you get started quickly and explore advanced features with ease.

## Key Available Algorithms

- **3D Boolean** performs fast, highly optimized mesh- and voxel-based operations.
- **Mesh Repair** eliminates self-intersections, fills holes, and removes degeneracies.
- **Mesh Offsetting** controls surface thickness with multiple precise modes for 3D printing and machining.
- **Hole Filling** fills flat and curved surfaces, connects or separates holes, and builds bridges.
- **Mesh Simplification** optimizes mesh complexity while keeping details within set tolerance. We provide remeshing, and subdivision options as well.
- **Collision Detection** verifies intersections between models for further operations.
- **Extensive File Format Support** enables importing a wide range of file formats for meshes, point clouds, CT scans, polylines, distance maps, and G-code. Export functionalities—and support for color and texture data—are available for select formats, too (see the [full list for details](https://meshlib.io/feature/file-formats-supported-by-meshlib/)).
- **Triangulation** converts point clouds into meshes with accurate normal creation.
- **ICP** precisely aligns meshes using point-to-point and point-to-plane transformations.
- **Segmentation** performs semi-automatic segmentation based on curvature for meshes and voxels.
- **Deformation** applies Laplacian, freeform, and relaxation smoothing for fine mesh adjustments.
- **Support of Distance Maps and Polylines** allows to generate distance maps and iso-lines and performs projection and intersection.
