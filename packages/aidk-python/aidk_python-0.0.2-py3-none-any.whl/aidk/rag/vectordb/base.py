class BaseVectorDB:
    """
    Abstract base class for vector database implementations.
    
    This class defines the interface that all vector database backends must implement.
    It provides common functionality for document embedding and defines the contract
    for database operations like creation, addition, querying, and deletion.
    
    The base class handles:
    - Configuration of embedding models and providers
    - Document vectorization using the specified embedding model
    - Common interface for all vector database operations
    
    Attributes:
        _name (str): Name of the vector database collection
        _vectorizer_provider (str): The embedding provider (e.g., "openai", "anthropic")
        _vectorizer_model (str): The specific embedding model to use
    
    Note:
        This is an abstract base class. Use concrete implementations like
        ChromaVectorDB for actual vector database operations.
