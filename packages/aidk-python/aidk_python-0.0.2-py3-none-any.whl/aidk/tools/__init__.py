"""
Tools are used to extend the capabilities of an agent.

In AIDK tools are simple functions that return a string, you can easily create your own tools by defining a function and registering it with the agent.
To let the agent know how to use the tool, you need to add a docstring to the function in google format.

For example:
```python
def get_weather(location:str):
    \"\"\"
    Get the weather for a given location:
    Args:
        location: The location to get the weather for
    Returns:
        The weather for the given location
    \"\"\"

    return f"The weather for {location} is sunny"
```
