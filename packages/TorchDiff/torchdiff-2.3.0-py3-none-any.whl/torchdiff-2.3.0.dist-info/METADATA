## 🔎 Overview  

**TorchDiff** is a PyTorch-based library for building and experimenting with diffusion models, inspired by leading research papers.  

The **TorchDiff 2.0.0** release includes implementations of five major diffusion model families:  
- **DDPM** (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models)  
- **DDIM** (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models)  
- **SDE-based Diffusion**  
- **LDM** (Latent Diffusion Models)  
- **UnCLIP** (the model powering OpenAI’s *DALL·E 2*)  

These models support both **conditional** (e.g., text-to-image) and **unconditional** generation.

</div>

TorchDiff is designed with **modularity** in mind. Each model is broken down into reusable components:  
- **Forward Diffusion**: Adds noise (e.g., `ForwardDDPM`).  
- **Reverse Diffusion**: Removes noise to recover data (e.g., `ReverseDDPM`).  
- **Scheduler**: Controls noise schedules (e.g., `SchedulerDDPM`).  
- **Training**: Full training pipelines (e.g., `TrainDDPM`).  
- **Sampling**: Efficient inference and generation (e.g., `SampleDDPM`).  

Additional utilities:  
- **Diffusion Network**: A U-Net-like model with attention and time embeddings used as main model.  
- **Text Encoder**: Transformer-based (e.g., BERT) for conditional generation.  
- **Metrics**: Evaluation suite including MSE, PSNR, SSIM, FID, and LPIPS.

## ⚡ Quick Start  

Here’s a minimal working example to train and sample with **DDPM** on dummy data:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision import datasets, transforms
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

from torchdiff.ddpm import (SchedulerDDPM, ForwardDDPM, 
                            ReverseDDPM, TrainDDPM, SampleDDPM)
from torchdiff.utils import DiffusionNetwork, mse_loss

# dataset: CIFAR10
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(32),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))
])
train_dataset = datasets.CIFAR10(
    root="./data", train=True, download=True, transform=transform
)
train_loader = DataLoader(
    train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True
)
device = 'cuda' # gpu is used for training and sampling

# model components
diff_net = DiffusionNetwork(
    in_channels = 3,
    down_channels = [32, 64, 128],
    mid_channels = [128, 128],
    up_channels = [128, 64, 32],
    down_sampling = [True, True],
    time_embed_dim = 128,
    y_embed_dim = 128,
    num_down_blocks = 2,
    num_mid_blocks = 2,
    num_up_blocks = 2,
    dropout_rate = 0.1,
    cont_time = False # time is not continuous, if SDE models it should be true
)
print(sum(p.numel() for p in diff_net.parameters()))

vs = SchedulerDDPM(time_steps = 400)
fwd = ForwardDDPM(vs, 'noise') # network is trained to predict noise
rwd = ReverseDDPM(vs, 'noise')

# optimizer
optim = torch.optim.Adam(diff_net.parameters(), lr=1e-5)

# training algorithm
trainer = TrainDDPM(
    diff_net = diff_net,
    fwd_ddpm = fwd,
    rwd_ddpm = rwd,
    train_loader = train_loader,
    optim = optim,
    loss_fn = mse_loss,
    max_epochs = 10,
    device = device,
    grad_acc = 2
)
trainer()

# Sampling
sampler = SampleDDPM(
    rwd_ddpm = rwd,
    diff_net = diff_net,
    img_size = (32, 32),
    batch_size = 10,
    in_channels = 3,
    device = device
)
images = sampler()
```

## 🧩 Implemented Models  

### 1. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)  
**Paper**: [Ho et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239)  

DDPMs learn to reverse a gradual noise-adding process to generate high-quality images. TorchDiff provides a modular implementation for both unconditional and conditional (text-guided) generation.  

📓 [DDPM Example Notebook](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/TorchDiff/blob/systembiology/examples/ddpm.ipynb)  

---

### 2. Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM)  
**Paper**: [Song et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502)  

DDIM accelerates sampling by reducing the number of denoising steps while maintaining image quality. TorchDiff supports both conditional and unconditional DDIM generation.  

📓 [DDIM Example Notebook](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/TorchDiff/blob/systembiology/examples/ddim.ipynb)  

---

### 3. Score-Based Generative Models via Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE)  
**Paper**: [Song et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13456)  

SDE-based models generalize diffusion via stochastic processes, supporting multiple formulations: **VE, VP, sub-VP**, and deterministic **ODE** variants. TorchDiff includes full training and sampling pipelines for both conditional and unconditional use cases.  

📓 [SDE Example Notebook](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/TorchDiff/blob/systembiology/examples/sde.ipynb)  

---

### 4. Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)  
**Paper**: [Rombach et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752)  

LDMs operate in a compressed latent space using a VAE, enabling **efficient high-resolution image synthesis** with reduced computational cost. TorchDiff supports using DDPM, DDIM, or SDE as the diffusion backbone in latent space.  

📓 [LDM Example Notebook](https://github.com/LoqmanSamani/TorchDiff/blob/systembiology/examples/ldm.ipynb)  

---

### 5. UnCLIP (Hierarchical Text-Conditional Image Generation with CLIP Latents)  
**Paper**: [Ramesh et al., 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06125)  

UnCLIP, the architecture behind *DALL·E 2*, leverages **CLIP latents** to enable hierarchical text-to-image generation. It first maps text into CLIP’s multimodal embedding space, then performs diffusion-based generation in that space, followed by refinement in pixel space.  

Training UnCLIP is significantly more complex than other diffusion families, and thus a minimal example is not shown here.
