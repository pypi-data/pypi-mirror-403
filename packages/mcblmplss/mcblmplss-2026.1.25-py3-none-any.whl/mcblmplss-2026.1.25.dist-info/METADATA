**MCP server for querying U.S. public land data by coordinates.**

Drop a pin anywhere in the western U.S. and get comprehensive land data:

| Category | What you get |
|----------|--------------|
| **PLSS Location** | Section 12, Township 4N, Range 6E, Principal Meridian |
| **Land Manager** | BLM, Forest Service, NPS, Private, State, Tribal |
| **Mining Claims** | Active lode/placer claims with serial numbers |
| **Grazing Allotments** | Livestock grazing permits and acreage |
| **Wild Horses** | Herd Management Areas with population data |
| **Recreation Sites** | Campgrounds, trailheads, boat launches |
| **Wilderness Areas** | Designated Wilderness & Study Areas (WSAs) |
| **Wild Rivers** | Wild & Scenic River segments |
| **ACECs** | Areas of Critical Environmental Concern |

## When would I use this?

| Use Case | Tools to use |
|----------|--------------|
| **Dispersed camping** | `get_land_manager` — Check if it's BLM/USFS public land |
| **Trip planning** | `get_recreation_sites` — Find nearby campgrounds and trailheads |
| **Land research** | `get_plss_location` — Get legal descriptions for title searches |
| **Prospecting** | `get_mining_claims` — Check existing claims before staking |
| **Ranching** | `get_grazing_allotment` — Research grazing permit areas |
| **Wildlife viewing** | `get_wild_horse_herd` — Find wild horse/burro areas |
| **Backcountry planning** | `get_wilderness_area` — Identify wilderness regulations |
| **River trips** | `get_wild_river` — Check Wild & Scenic River status |
| **Conservation research** | `get_acec` — Find protected environmental areas |

## Installation

```bash
pip install mcblmplss
```

Or run directly:

```bash
uvx mcblmplss
```

### Add to Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add blm "uvx mcblmplss"
```

## Tools (19 total)

Each data type has two tools: a human-readable version and a `_details` version returning structured data.

Plus a batch tool for efficient multi-coordinate queries.

### PLSS — Public Land Survey System

```
> get_plss_location(40.0, -105.0)

Section 9, Township 1N, Range 68W, 6th Meridian
State: CO
PLSS ID: CO060010S0680W0SN090
```

### Batch PLSS Queries

Query multiple coordinates in parallel with optional county validation:

```
> get_plss_details_batch(
    coordinates=[[44.5, -115.8], [44.6, -115.9], [44.7, -116.0]],
    include_county=True
  )

{
  "results": [
    {
      "latitude": 44.5,
      "longitude": -115.8,
      "township": {"township": "13N", "range": "5E", ...},
      "section": {"section": "30", ...},
      "county": {"name": "Valley County", "fips": "16085", ...}
    },
    ...
  ],
  "total": 3,
  "successful": 3,
  "failed": 0,
  "unique_townships": ["13N 5E", "14N 4E"]
}
```

The `unique_townships` field is useful for discovering which Township/Range combinations exist within a sampling grid.

**County data** comes from Census TIGERweb (layer 82), not BLM PLSS. Use `include_county=True` when you need to validate that sampled points fall within an expected county.

### Land Manager — Surface Management Agency
