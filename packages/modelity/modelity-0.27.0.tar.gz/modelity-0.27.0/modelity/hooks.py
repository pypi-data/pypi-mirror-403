    Field preprocessors are used to filter input value on a field-specific

    Value returned by preprocessor is either passed to the next preprocessor
    (if any) or to the type parser assigned for the field that is being set or
    modified.

        The model type.

    **errors**
        Mutable list of errors.

        Can be extended by the preprocessor if preprocessing phase fails.
        Alternatively, preprocessor can raise :exc:`TypeError` exception that

        This allows the hook to access other model's fields in a read-write way

            into account when this functionality is used.

        Mutable list of errors.

        Can be extended by the postprocessor if postprocessing phase fails.

    supports wildcards via ``*`` (star) character.

    **ctx**

    **errors**
