* Keep commits focused and atomic
* Use clear commit messages

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lfnovo/esperanto.git
cd esperanto
```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --group dev
```

Note: If you need the `transformers` extra (for local model support), use:
```bash
uv sync --group dev --extra transformers
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
pytest
```

4. Run linting:
```bash
ruff check .
mypy .
```

## Code Style and Linting

We use `ruff` for code linting and formatting. Before submitting a PR, make sure to:

1. Run the linter to check for issues:
```bash
ruff check .
```

2. Fix auto-fixable issues:
```bash
ruff check . --fix
```

The project's ruff configuration is in `pyproject.toml` and enforces:
- Line length of 88 characters
- Standard Python style rules (E, F)
- Import sorting (I)

## Testing

* Write tests for any new features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR
* Run the full test suite with `pytest`

## Documentation

* Update the README.md if needed
* Add docstrings for new functions and classes
* Keep documentation clear and concise
