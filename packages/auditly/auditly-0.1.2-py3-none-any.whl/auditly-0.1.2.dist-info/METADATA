# Auditly

**Auditly** is a modern, developer-friendly **Python dependency security and dependency-analysis CLI tool** that helps teams **identify vulnerabilities, risky versions, and dependency issues early** — before they reach production.

Auditly focuses on **clarity, speed, and actionable output**, making security **understandable and fixable** for developers.

---

## Why Auditly?

Most dependency scanners stop at direct dependencies.  
Auditly goes deeper.

- Simple CLI, zero configuration
- Scans installed environments & `requirements.txt`
- Optional **transitive dependency scanning**
- **Dependency tree visualization**
- Highlights vulnerable & risky package versions
- Shows fix suggestions when available
- JSON output for CI/CD pipelines
- Enterprise-ready foundation

## Examples
### 1. Default scan of installed environment

```bash
auditly
```

**Output:**

```text
[auditly] Vulnerability Scan Summary
Total Packages Scanned      : 10
Total Vulnerabilities Found : 2

Package     : flask==0.12

## Dependency Tree Feature

Auditly includes a powerful **Dependency Tree Visualization** feature that allows you to view the entire dependency hierarchy of your Python project. This feature is particularly useful for identifying transitive dependencies and understanding how packages are interconnected.

### Commands for Dependency Tree

| **Command / Flag**              | **Description**                                                                 | **Example**                          |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `auditly pkg requests==<version> --tree` | Displays the dependency tree for a specific package and version               | `auditly pkg requests==2.31.0 --tree`|
| `auditly pkg --tree`            | Displays the dependency tree for all packages in the installed environment      | `auditly pkg --tree`                 |

### Example Output

```bash
auditly pkg --tree
```

**Output:**

```text
[auditly] Dependency Tree

flask==2.0.3
├── Werkzeug>=2.0
├── Jinja2>=3.0
│   └── MarkupSafe>=2.0
└── itsdangerous>=2.0

requests==2.31.0
└── urllib3>=1.26.5
```

This output shows the top-level dependencies and their sub-dependencies, making it easy to identify potential issues or vulnerabilities in the dependency chain.
