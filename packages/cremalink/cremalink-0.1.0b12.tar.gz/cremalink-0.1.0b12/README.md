## ✨ Overview

Cremalink provides a unified interface to interact with smart coffee machines via **Local LAN control** or **Cloud API**. It allows for real-time state monitoring and precise command execution.

> [!TIP]
> For detailed guides, advanced configuration, and developer deep-dives, please visit our **[Project Wiki](https://github.com/miditkl/cremalink/wiki)**.

> [!NOTE] 
> This project was developed with a result-oriented approach, primarily optimized for the De'Longhi PrimaDonna Soul. While the architecture is designed to be extensible, some logic may currently be tightly coupled to this specific model and might not work seamlessly with others yet.
>The goal is to make the library fully generic. If you notice parts that are too specific to the PrimaDonna Soul or encounter issues with other machines, we highly encourage contributions! Refactoring and generalizations are very welcome to improve support for a wider range of devices.

## 🚀 Installation

Install the package via `pip` (Cremalink requires **Python 3.13+**):

```bash
pip install cremalink

```

### Optional Dependencies

To include tools for development or testing:

```bash
pip install "cremalink[dev]"   # For notebooks and kernel support
pip install "cremalink[test]"  # For running pytest suites

```

---

## 🛠 Usage

### Integrated API Server

Cremalink includes a FastAPI-based server for headless environments:

```bash
# Start the server
cremalink-server --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 10280 --settings_path "conf.json"
```
> More information: [Local Server Setup](https://github.com/miditkl/cremalink/wiki/3.-Local-Server-Setup)

### Python API (Local Control)

Connect to your machine directly via your local network for the lowest latency.
