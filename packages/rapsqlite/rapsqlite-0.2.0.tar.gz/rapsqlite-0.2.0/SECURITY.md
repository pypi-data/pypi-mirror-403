## Resolved Vulnerabilities

### ✅ Resolved: pyo3 0.20.3 → 0.27

**Advisory ID:** RUSTSEC-2025-0020  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Issue:** Risk of buffer overflow in `PyString::from_object`  
**Previous Version:** 0.20.3  
**Current Version:** 0.27  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**URL:** https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0020

**Resolution:**
- Upgraded pyo3 from 0.20.3 to 0.27 (fixes vulnerability)
- Migrated from pyo3-asyncio 0.20 to pyo3-async-runtimes 0.27 (required for pyo3 0.27 compatibility)
- Updated code to use pyo3 0.27 API (Bound types, Python::attach, etc.)

### ✅ Resolved: sqlx 0.7.4 → 0.8

**Advisory ID:** RUSTSEC-2024-0363  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Issue:** Binary Protocol Misinterpretation caused by Truncating or Overflowing Casts  
**Previous Version:** 0.7.4  
**Current Version:** 0.8  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**URL:** https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0363

**Resolution:**
- Upgraded sqlx from 0.7.4 to 0.8 (fixes vulnerability)
- No code changes required (sqlx 0.8 API compatible with existing usage)
- Upgrade to sqlx 0.8 resolved indirect dependency issues (rsa, paste)

## Security Improvements (v0.1.0)

### SQL Injection Protection
- ✅ **Parameterized queries**: All SQL queries use sqlx's parameterized query system
  - `sqlx::query()` automatically handles parameter binding
  - Prevents SQL injection attacks via malicious user input
  - Ensures proper escaping and type handling

### Input Validation
- ✅ Path validation: All database paths are validated before use
  - Non-empty path check
  - Null byte detection (prevents path traversal via null bytes)
  - Validation occurs before any database operations

### Error Handling
- ✅ Enhanced error messages with database path and query context
  - Errors include the database path and SQL query involved
  - Helps with debugging and security incident investigation
  - Provides better visibility into which databases and queries are affected

## Security Practices

### Code Security
- ✅ No unsafe code blocks in codebase
- ✅ All code passes clippy security-focused lints
- ✅ Uses safe Rust APIs exclusively
- ✅ Parameterized queries via sqlx (prevents SQL injection)
- ✅ Only uses sqlite feature of sqlx (minimizes attack surface)
- ✅ Input validation on all user-provided paths
- ✅ Enhanced error handling with operation context

### Dependency Management
- 🔄 Regular security audits recommended via `cargo audit`
- 🔄 Monitor for dependency updates
- 🔄 Update dependencies as part of regular maintenance
- ✅ Using minimal feature set (sqlite only, not mysql/postgres)
- ✅ All critical vulnerabilities resolved (v0.1.0)

## Running Security Checks

### Cargo Audit
```bash
cargo install cargo-audit
cargo audit
```

### Clippy Security Lints
```bash
cargo clippy --lib --all-features -- -W clippy::suspicious -W clippy::correctness
```

### Check for Unsafe Code
```bash
grep -r "unsafe {" src/ --include="*.rs"
```

## Update Schedule

Security audits should be run:
- Before each release
- Weekly via automated CI/CD (see `.github/workflows/security.yml`)
- After any dependency updates

## Previous Vulnerabilities (Now Resolved)

All vulnerabilities have been resolved in v0.1.0. The indirect dependency issues (rsa 0.9.10, paste 1.0.15) that were present in v0.0.1 are no longer present with the sqlx 0.8 upgrade. See "Resolved Vulnerabilities" section above for details.
