1.1.0 (29-01-2026)
-------------------

**Changelog:**

* feat: extend support for additional firmware versions. As of v1.1.0, ``qblox-instruments`` versions are no longer strictly tied to cluster firmware versions. You may now independently update ``qblox-instruments`` to ``>=1.1.0`` and cluster firmware to ``>=0.13.0`` without breaking code or experiments. Access to new features will still require updating one or both. (!485)
* feat: add support for our new quantum readout & control module (the QRC)
* feat: add mac address to `DeviceInfo`. This information can be retrieved via the method ``Cluster.get_json_description()["mac_address"]`` or via ``qblox-cfg <ip> describe`` (!524)
* fix: allow users to install qblox-instruments using poetry.
* feat: add --skip-version-check to skip update compatibility checks.

**Breaking Change:**

* feat: support dynamic loading of SCPI commands from the cluster (!506). 

to support dynamic loading of SCPI commands, ``qblox_instruments.native.Cluster`` uses **composition** instead of **inheritance** from ``qblox_instruments.scpi.Cluster``. This change is breaking for users that create custom ``native.Cluster`` subclasses that override commands from the SCPI layer such as ``_write`` or ``_read``. To achieve the same behavior, these methods will now need to be monkey patched, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python

    class SuperCluster(Cluster):
    
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self._scpi._write = self._write

        def _write(self, *args, **kwargs):
            pass


Alternatively, we provided a ``qblox_instruments.native.ClusterLegacy`` class that behaves as `native.Cluster` in ``qblox-instruments==1.0`` that supports inheritance. Note that this legacy class is not compatible with the new QRC module. 


**Driver/Firmware Compatibility:**

* Cluster: Compatible with firmware versions `>=0.13.0, <2 <https://gitlab.com/qblox/releases/cluster_releases/-/releases/>`__.
* Includes all features from firmware `v1.0.0 <https://gitlab.com/qblox/releases/cluster_releases/-/releases/v1.0.0>`__.

* feat: extend support for additional firmware versions. As of v1.1.0, qblox-instruments versions are no longer strictly tied to cluster firmware versions. You may now independently update qblox-instruments to >=1.1.0 and cluster firmware to >=0.13.0 without breaking code or experiments. Access to new features will still require updating one or both.

0.6.0 (29-03-2022)
------------------
This release introduces a significant refactor to Qblox Instruments as both a general restructure is introduced
and the preliminary Cluster driver is replaced by the definitive driver. Unfortunately, this means that this
release also introduces a few breaking changes. In exchange, we believe that this release prepares Qblox Instruments
for the future.

Changelog:

* Renamed all classes to be compliant with PEP8's capswords format.
* Restructured imports; all drivers are now imported directly from `qblox_instruments` as follows:
    * from qblox_instruments import Cluster, Pulsar, SpiRack
    * from qblox_instruments.qcodes_drivers.spi_rack_modules import D5aModule, S4gModule
* With the new Cluster firmware release, the user now interacts with the Cluster as a single instrument instead
  of a rack of instruments. The new Cluster driver reflects this. It detects where and which modules are in the rack
  and automatically makes them accessible as an InstrumentChannel submodule accessible as `Cluster.module<x>`, where
  `x` is the slot index of the rack.
* The Pulsar QCM and Pulsar QRM drivers have been combined into a single Pulsar driver that covers the functionality
  of both.
* The SPI Rack driver driver has been split into a native and QCoDeS layer to improve separation of functionality.
* Each sequencer's parameters are now accessible through it's own InstrumentChannel submodule. This means
  that parameters are now accessible as `module.sequencer<x>.parameter`, where `x` is the sequencer index.
* Renamed `get_system_status` to `get_system_state` to be inline with other state method names.
* The methods `get_system_state` and `get_sequencer_state` now return namedtuples of type `SystemState` and
  `SequencerState` respectively to ease handling of the returned statuses and accompanying flags.
* Renamed the sequencer's `waveform_and_programs` parameter to `sequence`.
* The way to configure the driver as a dummy has been changed to use enums for module type selection.
* Added keep alive pinging to the socket interface to keep the instrument connection from closing after
  a platform dependant idle period.
* Fixed general code duplication problem between instruments.
* Introduced `qblox-cfg` as the new configuration management tool with which to update the Cluster and Pulsar
  instruments. As of Pulsar firmware release v0.7.0 and Cluster firmware release v0.2.0, the configuration
  management tool is no longer shipped with the release, but instead `qblox-cfg` must be used. This new tool provides
  far more functionality and exposes the improved network configurability of the latest firmware releases.
* On top of the new configuration management tool, `qblox-pnp` is also instroduced as the new network debug tool.
  This tool, in combination with the latest firmware releases, allows to easily find instruments in the network and
  to potentially recover them in case of network/IP configuration problems.
* Improved unit test coverage.
* Updated the documentation on Read the Docs to reflect the changes.
* Added various improvements and fixes to the tutorials.
