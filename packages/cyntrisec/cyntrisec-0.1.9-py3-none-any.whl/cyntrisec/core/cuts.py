"""
Minimal Cut Finder - Find optimal remediations that block attack paths.

Uses a greedy set-cover approximation approach to find the minimum set of
edges (relationships) whose removal disconnects all entry points from
all sensitive targets.

The algorithm works by:
1. Building a flow network from entry points to targets
2. Finding edges that appear on multiple attack paths
3. Selecting edges that block the most paths with fewest changes
4. Ranking remediations based on ROI (Risk Reduction vs Cost Savings)
