**PhantomFetch** is a high-performance, agentic web scraping library for Python. It seamlessly combines the speed of `curl-cffi` with the capabilities of `Playwright`, offering a unified API for all your data extraction needs.

## Why PhantomFetch?

Most web scraping requires choosing between speed (httpx, requests) or browser capabilities (Playwright, Selenium). PhantomFetch gives you **both** with a unified interface:

| Feature | PhantomFetch | requests/httpx | Playwright/Selenium |
|---------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Speed** | ⚡ Fast (curl-cffi) | ⚡ Fast | 🐌 Slow |
| **JavaScript Support** | ✅ Yes (Playwright) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Anti-Detection** | ✅ Built-in | ❌ No | ⚠️ Manual |
| **Smart Caching** | ✅ Configurable | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Proxy Rotation** | ✅ Automatic | ⚠️ Manual | ⚠️ Manual |
| **Async-First** | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Partial | ✅ Yes |
| **Unified API** | ✅ One interface | N/A | N/A |
| **OpenTelemetry** | ✅ Built-in | ❌ No | ❌ No |

**Key Benefits:**
- 🎯 **Start Fast, Scale Smart**: Use curl for quick requests, switch to browser when needed
- 🧠 **Intelligent**: Automatic retry logic, exponential backoff, fingerprint rotation
- 🚀 **Production-Ready**: Built-in observability, caching, and error handling
- 🛠️ **Developer-Friendly**: Intuitive API, comprehensive type hints, rich documentation

## Features

- 🚀 **Unified API**: Switch between `curl` (fast, lightweight) and `browser` (JavaScript-capable) engines with a single parameter
- 🧠 **Smart Caching**: Configurable caching strategies (`all`, `resources`, `conservative`) to speed up development and save bandwidth
- 🤖 **Agentic Actions**: Define browser interactions (click, scroll, input, wait) declaratively
- 🛡️ **Anti-Detection**: Built-in support for proxy rotation and fingerprinting protection (via `curl-cffi`)
- ⚡ **Async First**: Built on `asyncio` for high concurrency
- 🔄 **Smart Retries**: Configurable retry logic with exponential backoff
- 🍪 **Cookie Management**: Automatic cookie handling across engines
- 📊 **Observability**: OpenTelemetry integration out of the box

## Installation

```bash
pip install phantomfetch
# or with uv (recommended)
uv pip install phantomfetch
```

After installation, install Playwright browsers:
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Fetch (Curl Engine)

```python
import asyncio
from phantomfetch import Fetcher

async def main():
    async with Fetcher() as f:
        response = await f.fetch("https://httpbin.org/get")
        print(response.json())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Browser Fetch with Caching

Use the `resources` strategy to cache static assets (images, CSS, scripts) while keeping the main page fresh.

```python
from phantomfetch import Fetcher, FileSystemCache

async def main():
    # Cache sub-resources to speed up subsequent fetches
    cache = FileSystemCache(strategy="resources")

    async with Fetcher(browser_engine="cdp", cache=cache) as f:
        # First run: downloads everything
        resp = await f.fetch("https://example.com", engine="browser")

        # Second run: uses cached resources, only fetches main HTML
        resp = await f.fetch("https://example.com", engine="browser")
        print(resp.text)
```

### Browser Actions

Perform interactions like clicking, scrolling, and taking screenshots:

```python
from phantomfetch import Fetcher

actions = [
    {"action": "wait", "selector": "#search-input"},
    {"action": "input", "selector": "#search-input", "value": "phantomfetch"},
    {"action": "click", "selector": "#search-button"},
    {"action": "wait_for_load"},
    {"action": "screenshot", "value": "search_results.png"}
]

async with Fetcher(browser_engine="cdp") as f:
    resp = await f.fetch("https://example.com", actions=actions, engine="browser")
    # Screenshot saved to search_results.png
```

### Advanced: Retry Configuration

Fine-tune retry behavior per request:

```python
from phantomfetch import Fetcher

async with Fetcher() as f:
    # Custom retry logic for flaky endpoints
    resp = await f.fetch(
        "https://api.example.com/data",
        max_retries=5,  # Override default retries
        timeout=60.0,   # Longer timeout for slow APIs
    )
```

### Cookie Handling

Pass cookies to any engine and retrieve them from the response:

```python
from phantomfetch import Fetcher, Cookie

async with Fetcher() as f:
    # Set cookies
    resp = await f.fetch(
        "https://httpbin.org/cookies",
        cookies={"session_id": "secret_token"}
    )
    print(resp.json())

    # Get cookies (including from redirects)
    resp = await f.fetch("https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/foo/bar")
    for cookie in resp.cookies:
        print(f"{cookie.name}: {cookie.value}")
```

## Configuration

### Caching Strategies

- **`all`**: Caches everything, including the main document. Good for offline development
- **`resources`** (Default): Caches sub-resources (images, styles, scripts) but fetches the main document fresh. Best for scraping dynamic sites
- **`conservative`**: Caches only heavy static assets like images and fonts

Example:
```python
from phantomfetch import FileSystemCache, Fetcher

cache = FileSystemCache(
    cache_dir=".cache",
    strategy="resources"
)

async with Fetcher(cache=cache) as f:
    # Resources will be cached automatically
    resp = await f.fetch("https://example.com", engine="browser")
```

### Proxy Rotation

Multiple proxy strategies available:

```python
from phantomfetch import Fetcher, Proxy, ProxyPool

# 1. Define Typed Proxies
proxies = [
    Proxy(
        url="http://user:pass@residential-us.com:8080", 
        location="US", 
        vendor="BrightData",
        proxy_type="residential",
        weight=10
    ),
    Proxy(
        url="http://user:pass@datacenter-de.com:8080", 
        location="DE", 
        vendor="OxyLabs",
        proxy_type="datacenter",
        weight=1
    ),
]

# 2. Create a Smart Pool
pool = ProxyPool(proxies, strategy="geo_match")

async with Fetcher(proxies=pool) as f:
    # Uses US proxy from pool (geo-match)
    await f.fetch("https://google.com", location="US")

    # Uses any available proxy (fallback)
    await f.fetch("https://example.com")
    
    # 3. Explicit Override (Bypass Pool)
    # Useful for debugging or specific routing needs
    await f.fetch(
        "https://httpbin.org/ip", 
        proxy="http://user:pass@specific-proxy:8080"
    )
```

### Observability (OpenTelemetry)

PhantomFetch is fully instrumented with OpenTelemetry:

```python
from phantomfetch.telemetry import configure_telemetry
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import ConsoleSpanExporter

# Setup OTel with custom service name
configure_telemetry(service_name="my-scraper")

async with Fetcher() as f:
    await f.fetch("https://example.com")
    # Spans automatically created and exported
```

Or use standard OpenTelemetry environment variables:
```bash
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="my-scraper"
export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER="console"
python my_scraper.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Playwright Installation Issues

If you encounter browser-related errors:
```bash
# Install all browsers
playwright install

# Or just chromium (recommended)
playwright install chromium

# Check installation
playwright install --help
```

### SSL Certificate Errors

For development/testing, you can disable SSL verification:
```python
# Note: Only use this in development!
async with Fetcher() as f:
    # SSL verification is handled by curl-cffi and Playwright
    # For curl engine, certificates are validated by default
    resp = await f.fetch("https://self-signed.badssl.com/")
```

### Memory Issues with Caching

If cache grows too large:
```python
from phantomfetch import FileSystemCache

cache = FileSystemCache(cache_dir=".cache")

# Manually clear expired entries
cache.clear_expired()

# Or just delete the cache directory
import shutil
shutil.rmtree(".cache", ignore_errors=True)
```

### Browser Engine Not Working

Common issues:
1. **Playwright not installed**: Run `playwright install chromium`
2. **Marimo notebook issues**: Browser engines may not work in some notebook environments
3. **Port conflicts**: CDP uses random ports, but firewall rules might block them

Debug with:
```python
async with Fetcher(browser_engine="cdp") as f:
    # Enable verbose logging
    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

    resp = await f.fetch("https://example.com", engine="browser")
```

### Rate Limiting / 429 Errors

Use retry configuration and delays:
```python
import asyncio

async with Fetcher(max_retries=5) as f:
    for url in urls:
        resp = await f.fetch(url)
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Be nice to servers
```

### Scrapeless Session Recording

When using Scrapeless's CDP endpoint for session recording, PhantomFetch automatically reuses existing browser windows:

```python
async with Fetcher(
    browser_engine="cdp",
    browser_engine_config={
        "cdp_endpoint": "wss://YOUR_SESSION.scrapeless.com/chrome/cdp"
        # use_existing_page=True (default) ensures recording compatibility
    }
) as f:
    # Uses existing window - Scrapeless records this! ✓
    resp = await f.fetch("https://example.com", engine="browser")
```

**Why this matters**: Scrapeless can only record a single window. By default (`use_existing_page=True`), PhantomFetch detects and reuses the existing browser page in your Scrapeless session instead of creating new windows.

**To disable** (not recommended for recording): Set `use_existing_page=False` in `browser_engine_config`.

See [`examples/scrapeless_cdp_recording.py`](examples/scrapeless_cdp_recording.py) for a complete example.
