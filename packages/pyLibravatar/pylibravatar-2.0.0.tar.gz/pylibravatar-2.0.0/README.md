# pyLibravatar

PyLibravatar is an easy way to make use of the federated [Libravatar](http://www.libravatar.org)
avatar hosting service from within your Python applications.

See the [project page](https://github.com/libravatar/pylibravatar) for the bug tracker and downloads.

## Installation

To install using pip, simply do this:

    $ pip install pylibravatar

## Usage

To generate the correct avatar URL based on someone's email address, use the
following:

    >>> from libravatar import libravatar_url
    >>> url = libravatar_url(email='person@example.com')
    >>> print(f'<img src="{url}">')

Here are other options you can provide:

    >>> url = libravatar_url(openid = 'http://example.org/id/Bob', https = True, size = 96, default = 'mm')

See the [Libravatar documentation](http://wiki.libravatar.org/api) for more
information on the special values for the "default" parameter.
