# HubSpot Workflow Backup & Restore

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/ft-hubspot-workflow-backup)](https://pypi.org/project/ft-hubspot-workflow-backup/)

Backup and restore HubSpot Automation (v4) workflows. There is NO confirmation once you request a restore, it will just overwrite the workflow.

## Installation

```bash
# From PyPI
pip install ft-hubspot-workflow-backup

# Or with uv
uv pip install ft-hubspot-workflow-backup

# Or add to pyproject.toml
# dependencies = ["ft-hubspot-workflow-backup>=0.1.0"]
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ (recommended with [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv))
- HubSpot private app token with `automation` read/write scope
- Environment variable `HUBSPOT_AUTOMATION_TOKEN` set to your token

## Usage

### Backup all workflows

```bash
uv run workflows-backup
```

Creates `snapshots/` with:
- One JSON file per workflow: `<slugified-name>.json`
- An `_index.json` listing all backed up flows with SHA-256 hashes for verification

Options:
- `-o, --output-dir <path>`: Custom output directory (default: `./snapshots/`)
- `--use-date-dir`: Create a timestamped subdirectory (e.g., `snapshots/2026_01_20_123456/`)
- `--use-date-prefix`: Prefix filenames with timestamp (e.g., `2026_01_20_123456_workflow-name.json`)
- `--verify`: Verify backup integrity immediately after completion

Example with date organization:
```bash
uv run workflows-backup --use-date-dir --use-date-prefix
```

### Restore a workflow

```bash
uv run workflows-restore <backup-file> [--flow-id <id>] [--name "<name>"] [--dry]
```

Options:
- `--flow-id`: Target flow ID (defaults to ID in backup)
- `--name`: Override flow name
- `--dry`: Preview payload without sending

Example:
```bash
uv run workflows-restore snapshots/<workflow-name>.json --dry
```

### As a Python module

```python
from ft_hubspot_workflow_backup import backup_all_flows, restore_flow, verify_backups, HubSpotClient

# Backup (uses HUBSPOT_AUTOMATION_TOKEN env var)
snapshot_dir = backup_all_flows()

# With date-based organization
snapshot_dir = backup_all_flows(use_date_dir=True, use_date_prefix=True)

# Or with explicit token and custom output
client = HubSpotClient(token="your-token")
snapshot_dir = backup_all_flows(client=client, output_dir="./my-snapshots")

# Verify backups
results = verify_backups("./my-snapshots")
print(f"Verified: {len(results['verified'])}, Failed: {len(results['failed'])}")

# Restore
restore_flow("path/to/backup.json", flow_id="123456")
```

## Cryptographic Verification

Each backup includes SHA-256 hashes in `_index.json` to cryptographically verify workflow integrity. This allows you to detect if a workflow file has been modified since backup.

### Verify a single workflow

```bash
# Compare the stored hash with the actual file hash
shasum -a 256 snapshots/<workflow-name>.json
# Then compare with the hash in _index.json
```

### Verify all workflows (bash)

```bash
cd snapshots
for file in *.json; do
  [[ "$file" == "_index.json" ]] && continue
  expected=$(jq -r ".flows[] | select(.filename == \"$file\") | .hash" _index.json)
  actual=$(shasum -a 256 "$file" | cut -d' ' -f1)
  if [[ "$expected" == "$actual" ]]; then
    echo "✓ $file"
  else
    echo "✗ $file (hash mismatch)"
  fi
done
```

### Verify programmatically (Python)

```python
from ft_hubspot_workflow_backup import verify_backups

results = verify_backups("snapshots")
print(f"Verified: {len(results['verified'])}, Failed: {len(results['failed'])}")

if results["failed"]:
    print("Hash mismatches:", results["failed"])
if results["missing"]:
    print("Missing files:", results["missing"])
```

## Notes

- Secrets (`secretNames`) are not backed up; only their names are referenced.
- Flows reference HubSpot assets (pipelines, stages, templates) by ID. Restores assume those IDs are still valid.
- Restored flows are always set to DISABLED. Enable manually after verifying.
