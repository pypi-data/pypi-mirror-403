### ⚡ Async/Await Fundamentals

If you're new to async/await in Python, here are the key concepts you'll encounter:

- `async def`: Defines an asynchronous function that can be awaited
- `await`: Waits for an async operation to complete without blocking
- `async with`: Asynchronous context manager for resource management
- `async for`: Asynchronous iteration over async iterables

Nexios uses async/await extensively for handling concurrent requests efficiently. Don't worry if this is new to you - we'll cover it in detail throughout the documentation.


## 📦 Installation

Nexios can be installed using any Python package manager. We recommend using `uv` for the fastest and most reliable experience.

### Recommended: Using uv

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a modern Python package manager that's significantly faster than traditional tools. It's a drop-in replacement for pip, pip-tools, and virtualenv.

::: code-group
```bash [Install uv]
# Install uv globally
pip install uv

# Create a new project directory
mkdir my-nexios-app
cd my-nexios-app

# Create a virtual environment and install Nexios
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install nexios
```

```bash [Alternative: Direct installation]
# Install uv and Nexios in one command
uv init my-nexios-app
cd my-nexios-app
uv add nexios
```
:::

### Alternative Package Managers

::: code-group
```bash [pip]
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install Nexios
pip install nexios
```

```bash [poetry]
# Create a new project
poetry new my-nexios-app
cd my-nexios-app

# Add Nexios
poetry add nexios

# Activate environment
poetry shell
```

```bash [pipenv]
# Create a new project directory
mkdir my-nexios-app
cd my-nexios-app

# Initialize project
pipenv install nexios

# Activate environment
pipenv shell
```

::: tip Virtual Environments
Always use virtual environments to isolate your project dependencies. This prevents conflicts between different projects and keeps your system Python clean.

**Benefits of virtual environments:**
- 🛡️ Isolate project dependencies
- 🚫 Avoid version conflicts
- 📤 Easy project sharing and deployment
- 🧹 Clean system Python installation
- 🔄 Reproducible builds

**Creating virtual environments:**
```bash
# With uv (recommended)
uv venv

# With venv (built-in)
python -m venv venv

# With virtualenv
virtualenv venv
```

## 🛠️ Your First Nexios Application

Now that you have Nexios installed, let's create your first application. We'll start with a simple example and gradually build up to more complex features.

### Basic Application

Create a file named `main.py`:

```python
from nexios import NexiosApp
import uvicorn 

# Create a new Nexios application
app = NexiosApp()

# Define a simple route
@app.get("/")
async def hello_world(request, response):
    return response.json({
        "message": "Hello from Nexios!",
        "status": "success"
    })

# If you forget to use async def for your handler, Nexios will run the handler in a threadpool

# If you define two routes with the same path and method, Nexios will raise a conflict error at startup.

# Run the application
if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("main:app")
```

### Running Your Application

You can run your Nexios application in several ways:

::: code-group
```bash [Direct execution]
python main.py
```

```bash [Nexios CLI (Requires Click)]
nexios run --reload
```
```bash [With uvicorn (recommended)]
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

```bash [With hypercorn]
hypercorn main:app --reload --bind 127.0.0.1:8000
```
:::

::: tip Development Server
For development, we recommend using `uvicorn` with the `--reload` flag. This will automatically restart your application when you make changes to your code.

**Benefits of uvicorn:**
- 🔄 Auto-reload on code changes
- ⚡ Fast startup time
- 🐛 Good error reporting
- 📊 Built-in logging
- 🔧 Easy configuration
:::

### Testing Your Application

Once your application is running, you can test it by opening your browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

nexios provide an intaractive  API documentation interface. This allows you to test your API endpoints and explore the available routes.

## 🔍 Understanding the Code

Let's break down what's happening in our first application:

### 1. Application Creation

```python
from nexios import NexiosApp

app = NexiosApp()
```

- `NexiosApp()` creates a new web application instance
- This instance will handle all incoming HTTP requests
- It's configured with sensible defaults for development

### 2. Route Definition

```python
@app.get("/")
async def hello_world(request, response):
    return response.json({
        "message": "Hello from Nexios!",
        "status": "success"
    })

# If you forget to return a response, Nexios will raise an error indicating the handler did not return a response object.
```

- `@app.get("/")` decorates a function to handle GET requests to the root path
- The function must be `async` - this is a strict requirement in Nexios
- `request` and `response` are automatically provided by Nexios
- `response.json()` creates a JSON response with the specified data

### 3. Application Execution

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

# If you run this in production, make sure to use uvicorn or another ASGI server for better performance and reliability.
```

## ❓ Common Questions

### Why do all handlers need to be async?

Nexios is built on ASGI, which requires async handlers for optimal performance. Async handlers allow Nexios to handle multiple requests concurrently without blocking, leading to better performance and scalability.

### Can I use synchronous code in my handlers?

While handlers themselves must be async, you can call synchronous functions within them. However, for I/O operations (database queries, HTTP requests, file operations), you should use async alternatives for better performance.

If you call a blocking (sync) function in an async handler, your app may hang or perform poorly. Use `run_in_executor` for heavy sync work:

```python
import asyncio

def blocking_task():
    # Some CPU-bound or blocking code
    ...

@app.get("/heavy")
async def heavy_route(request, response):
    result = await asyncio.get_running_loop().run_in_executor(None, blocking_task)
    return response.json({"result": result})
```

### What happens if I pass invalid input or miss a required parameter?

If a required parameter is missing or invalid, Nexios will return a 422 error:

```python
@app.get("/items/{item_id}")
async def get_item(request, response, item_id: int):
    return response.json({"item_id": item_id})

# GET /items/abc will return a 422 Unprocessable Entity
```

### What if my middleware fails?

If your middleware raises an exception, it will interrupt the request and return a 500 error. Use try/except in middleware for graceful error handling:

```python


async def failing_middleware(self, request, response, call_next):
    try:
        # Your logic here
        return await call_next()
    except Exception as exc:
        return response.json({"error": str(exc)}, status_code=500)

app.add_middleware(failing_middleware)
```

### What if I try to dynamically import a handler that doesn't exist?

If a dynamically imported handler does not exist or fails to import, Nexios will raise an ImportError at startup.

### What if my custom path converter fails?

If your custom converter raises a ValueError, Nexios will return a 422 error with your message.

### How does Nexios compare to FastAPI/Django/Flask?

Nexios offers a unique combination of simplicity and performance:
- **vs FastAPI**: Simpler API, less boilerplate, easier learning curve
- **vs Django**: Lighter weight, more flexible, better for APIs
- **vs Flask**: Async-first, better performance, modern Python features

### What's the difference between `app.run()` and using uvicorn directly?

`app.run()` is a convenience method that starts a development server. For production, you should use uvicorn, hypercorn, or another ASGI server directly for better control and performance.
