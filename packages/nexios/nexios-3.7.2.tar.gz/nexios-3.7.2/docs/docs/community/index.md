# 👋 Welcome to the Nexios Community!

We're thrilled to have you here! The Nexios community is a place for developers to connect, share knowledge, and help each other build amazing applications with Nexios.

## 🌟 Open Source at Heart

Nexios is proudly **100% open source** and community-driven. We believe in the power of collaboration and transparency in building great software. Our entire ecosystem is built on open source principles:

- **Core Framework**: The main Nexios framework is completely open source under the MIT license
- **Community Contributions**: The [nexios-contrib](https://github.com/nexios-labs/nexios-contrib) package provides community-driven extensions and middleware
- **Transparent Development**: All development happens in the open on GitHub with public discussions and roadmaps

### Nexios Contrib Package

The **nexios-contrib** package is our community-driven collection of extensions, middleware, and add-ons that extend Nexios's capabilities. It includes:

- **URL Normalization Middleware** - Clean and consistent URL handling
- **Trusted Host Middleware** - Security against Host header attacks  
- **ETag Middleware** - Automatic ETag generation and conditional requests
- **JSON-RPC Support** - Full JSON-RPC 2.0 server and client implementation
- **Tortoise ORM Integration** - Complete async ORM integration with automatic lifecycle management

Install all contrib packages at once:
```bash
pip install nexios_contrib
```

Or explore individual packages in the [nexios-contrib repository](https://github.com/nexios-labs/nexios-contrib).

### Open Source Philosophy

We believe that great software is built by communities, not just companies. That's why:

- **Everything is MIT Licensed** - Use Nexios in any project, commercial or personal
- **No Vendor Lock-in** - You own your code and can modify anything
- **Community-First** - Major decisions are discussed openly with the community
- **Transparent Roadmap** - Our development priorities are public and community-influenced
- **Welcoming to All** - We maintain an inclusive environment for developers of all skill levels
