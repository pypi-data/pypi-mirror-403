# docx-template-export

A standalone Python library for exporting structured content (markdown or plain text) into Word (.docx) templates. This module is **strictly non-generative** - it does not call any LLMs and does not modify wording. It only maps existing content into Word document structures.

**Note:** This package was formerly known as `deterministic-docx-export`. The old package name is deprecated but remains functional for backward compatibility.

## Author

Created and maintained by **Ahsan Saeed**.

This project is designed with a strong focus on determinism, correctness, and enterprise-grade document generation.

## What's New in v0.3.1

### Bug Fixes

- **Cross-platform table formatting**: Tables now always have explicit XML borders defined, ensuring consistent rendering on Windows Word. Table style "TableGrid" is preferred, and explicit borders are applied even when styles succeed.

## What's New in v0.3.0

**Major Features: Tree-Based Rendering & Observability**

This release introduces a new tree-based rendering engine enabled by default, along with comprehensive observability features to track export execution. The library has moved from block-based rendering to tree-based rendering as the primary path, with block-based rendering remaining as a fallback.

### Key Features

#### Tree-Based Rendering (Enabled by Default)

- **Tree-Based Renderer**: New tree-based rendering engine that preserves exact order and nesting of markdown elements (lists, list items, tables, table cells)
- **Enabled by Default**: Tree renderer is enabled by default in v0.3.1. Can be disabled via `USE_MARKDOWN_TREE_RENDERER` environment variable (set to `"false"` to disable)
- **Enhanced Structure Preservation**: Tree renderer attempts to preserve semantic structure without flattening, allowing for more accurate rendering of complex nested structures
- **Graceful Fallback**: Tree parsing failures automatically fall back to block-based renderer to ensure export completion
- **Safety Parity**: Tree renderer provides similar safety guarantees as block-based renderer (atomic operations, freeze → validate → mutate)
- **Block-Based Renderer**: Remains available as the fallback path when tree renderer is disabled or encounters errors

#### Observability & Export Summary

- **Export Execution Summary**: New `ExportSummary` dataclass that records scalar replacements, block replacements, skipped items, fallback events, and warnings
- **Structured Logging**: Emit structured logs aligned with export summary, including successful replacements, skipped placeholders, fallback events, and safety constraint warnings
- **Enable/Disable Control**: New `enable_export_trace` flag in `WordExportRequest` (default: `True`) to gate summary collection and structured logging
- **Automatic Log Saving**: Export summaries are automatically saved to timestamped JSON files in a configurable log directory structure
- **Tree Renderer Observability**: Detect and log tree parsing failures, nested tables inside cells, and mixed ordered/bullet lists when tree-based renderer is enabled
- **Safety Invariant Documentation**: Added inline comments explaining critical design decisions, including why block placeholders must occupy entire paragraphs (block markdown cannot be mixed with text in the same paragraph)

### API Changes

- `export_to_word()` now returns `export_summary` (dictionary) and `export_summary_log_path` (string) when `enable_export_trace=True`
- `WordExportRequest` now includes `enable_export_trace` boolean field (default: `True`)

### Environment Variables

Three environment variables control export behavior (introduced in v0.3.0, updated in v0.3.1):

- **`OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`**: Base directory for output files
  - Default: Not set (relative paths resolved relative to current working directory)
  - If set, relative `output_path` parameters are resolved relative to this directory
  - Absolute `output_path` parameters are used as-is (this variable is ignored)
  - Useful for centralizing all exported documents in a single location

- **`USE_MARKDOWN_TREE_RENDERER`**: Control tree-based rendering engine (default: `True` - enabled)
  - Default: `True` - Tree renderer is enabled by default
  - Set to `"false"`, `"0"`, or `"no"` to disable and use block-based rendering
  - When enabled (default), the library uses tree-based parsing and rendering for block placeholders
  - When disabled, uses block-based rendering (legacy behavior)
  - Tree renderer provides enhanced structure preservation for complex nested markdown

- **`EXPORT_LOG_DIR`**: Customize the base directory for export summary logs (optional)
  - If set: Logs saved to `{EXPORT_LOG_DIR}/logs/{timestamp}/`
  - If not set: Logs saved to `{output_dir}/logs/{timestamp}/`
  - Each export run gets its own timestamped subdirectory

The library automatically loads `.env` files if `python-dotenv` is available.

All changes are fully backward compatible with no breaking API changes. See [OBSERVABILITY.md](OBSERVABILITY.md) for detailed documentation.

## What's New in v0.2.1

**Critical Release: Text Loss Bug Fixes**

This release fixes critical bugs that caused **markdown paragraphs to be silently lost** during export. The library's core guarantee is loss-less text preservation, and these fixes ensure that guarantee is maintained.

### Primary Fixes: Text Loss Prevention

- **Continuation paragraph preservation**: Fixed bug where multi-paragraph list items (both bullet and numbered) lost their continuation paragraphs. Continuation paragraphs are now preserved and rendered with proper indentation
- **Nested bullet list text loss**: Fixed critical bug where nested bullet lists inside ordered lists were completely skipped, causing guaranteed text loss. The parser now collects ALL paragraphs within nested bullet items
- **Free text before lists**: Fixed parsing bug where top-level paragraphs appearing before lists could be incorrectly merged or lost
- **Unsafe paragraph clearing**: Replaced unsafe `paragraph.clear()` with run-level text clearing to preserve formatting and prevent potential text loss
- **Placeholder detection failures**: Fixed bug where placeholders spanning multiple XML runs or containing line breaks could be missed. All placeholder detection now uses consistent XML-based text extraction

### Supporting Improvements

- **List spacing fix**: Neutralized Word's default paragraph spacing for list items and continuation paragraphs, ensuring spacing comes from markdown (`\n\n`) rather than Word defaults
- **Production-grade test suite**: Added comprehensive test suite with 28 tests enforcing text fidelity, determinism, and observability invariants. Includes specific regression tests for all known text-loss edge cases
- **Documentation improvements**: Enhanced docstrings and added explicit design contracts for list continuation paragraphs and block placeholder rules

All changes are fully backward compatible with no breaking API changes.

## What's New in v0.2.0

This release focuses on deterministic table rendering and safety hardening:

- **Safe nested Word table rendering**: Tables can now be rendered inside table cells with atomic commit and deterministic fallback to text rendering
- **Deterministic table formatting**: Tables use Word's built-in styles (TableGrid preferred) with explicit XML borders always applied for cross-platform compatibility (Windows Word requires explicit borders)
- **Multi-run–safe scalar replacement**: Scalar placeholders spanning multiple XML runs are safely replaced in headers, footers, and textboxes
- **Atomic block placeholder expansion**: Block placeholders use a freeze → validate → mutate model ensuring no partial mutations
- **Strict container guardrails**: Block expansion is restricted to BODY containers only, preventing unsafe operations in headers/footers/textboxes
- **Structural integrity guarantees**: Table cells maintain proper XML structure after placeholder replacement
- **Code quality improvements**: Removal of unused legacy helpers and addition of invariant documentation for maintainability

All changes are fully backward compatible with no breaking API changes.

## Features

- **Scalar placeholder replacement**: Replace simple placeholders like `{{document_id}}`, `{{title}}`, etc.
- **Block placeholder replacement**: Replace structured content blocks like `{{summary}}`, `{{proposal}}`, etc.
- **Tree-based rendering** (enabled by default): Enhanced rendering engine that attempts to preserve exact order and nesting of markdown elements (can be disabled via `USE_MARKDOWN_TREE_RENDERER` environment variable)
- **Block-based rendering** (fallback): Stable, proven rendering path that processes markdown as independent blocks (used when tree renderer is disabled or encounters errors)
- **Markdown parsing**: Convert markdown content to Word structures (headings, lists, tables)
- **Manual list rendering**: Bullet and numbered lists use deterministic glyph/number insertion (no Word numbering XML) for stable, cross-platform rendering
- **Plain text mode fallback**: Paragraphs only, no structure inference
- **Combined markdown export**: Exports a combined markdown file (`exported_markdown_content.md`) for content analysis
- **Flexible field mapping**: Use any placeholder names via `scalar_fields` and `block_fields` dictionaries

## Design Philosophy

This project prioritizes:

- Deterministic and reproducible output
- Exact content fidelity (no wording changes)
- Cross-platform Word rendering stability
- Explicit, manual control over list and layout behavior

Design decisions favor predictability and correctness over feature breadth.

## List Rendering Approach

- **Bullet lists**: Manual glyph insertion with configurable glyph sets and indentation policies defined by `ListRenderConfig`. Maximum visual depth is configurable. Deep nesting behavior beyond max_visual_depth is deterministic and policy-driven (clamp_last, cycle, or textual strategies).
- **Numbered lists**: Manual hierarchical numbering (1., 1.1., 1.1.1.) with Python-based counter tracking per list block. Numbers reset for each new list block.
- **Indentation**: Both list types use configurable manual paragraph indentation (default: 0.25" per level, -0.25" hanging indent, configurable via `ListRenderConfig`)
- **No Word numbering XML**: Ensures stable rendering across platforms (especially macOS)

### List Semantics

- **Tree-based rendering** (default): List rendering uses tree-based parsing that attempts to preserve exact order and nesting of list items, allowing for more accurate rendering of complex nested structures.
- **Block-based rendering** (fallback): When `USE_MARKDOWN_TREE_RENDERER=false`, list rendering is block-based, not AST-linked. Each markdown list block is processed independently and rendered as a separate visual block in Word.
- **Visual preservation**: Nested lists are preserved visually (indentation and glyphs reflect nesting depth), not structurally (no Word list object relationships).
- **Mixed lists**: In block-based rendering, mixed bullet ↔ numbered lists are rendered as separate blocks by design. This is a deliberate stability decision to ensure deterministic output and cross-platform consistency. Tree renderer may handle mixed lists differently when enabled.

### Deep Nesting

Very deep nesting (beyond `max_visual_depth`) may reduce readability due to Word layout constraints. This is a limitation of Word document layout, not the export engine. The engine handles deep nesting deterministically according to the configured strategy, but visual clarity may degrade with extreme nesting.

## Usage

### Minimal Example

```python
from pathlib import Path
from docx_template_export.models.export_models import WordExportRequest
from docx_template_export.services.word_export_service import export_to_word

# Create export request
request = WordExportRequest(
    scalar_fields={
        "title": "My Document",
        "author": "John Doe",
    },
    block_fields={
        "content": "# Introduction\n\nThis is the content with **bold** text.",
    }
)

# Export to Word
# Note: If OUTPUT_DIRECTORY environment variable is set, relative paths like
# "output.docx" are resolved relative to that directory. Absolute paths are used as-is.
result = export_to_word(
    template_path=Path("template.docx"),
    request=request,
    markdown_mode=True,
    output_path=Path("output.docx"),
)

print(f"Word file: {result['word_file_path']}")
```

### Basic Example

```python
from pathlib import Path
from docx_template_export.models.export_models import WordExportRequest
from docx_template_export.services.word_export_service import export_to_word

# Create export request with dynamic fields
request = WordExportRequest(
    scalar_fields={
        "document_id": "DOC-12345",
        "title": "My Document",
        "author": "John Doe",
        "date": "2024-01-15",
    },
    block_fields={
        "introduction": "# Introduction\n\nThis is the introduction content...",
        "body": "## Main Content\n\nThis is the main body with **bold** and *italic* text.",
        "conclusion": "## Conclusion\n\nFinal thoughts here...",
    }
)

# Export to Word
# Note: Relative paths are resolved relative to OUTPUT_DIRECTORY (if set) or current directory
# Absolute paths (e.g., Path("/var/exports/doc.docx")) are used as-is
result = export_to_word(
    template_path=Path("template.docx"),
    request=request,
    markdown_mode=True,  # Set to False for plain text mode
    output_path=Path("output/exported_document.docx"),
)

print(f"Word file saved to: {result['word_file_path']}")
if result['markdown_files']:
    print(f"Markdown file saved to: {result['markdown_files'][0]}")
```

### Configuration Example

```python
from pathlib import Path
from docx_template_export.models.export_models import WordExportRequest
from docx_template_export.models.export_config import ListRenderConfig
from docx_template_export.services.word_export_service import export_to_word

# Create custom list rendering configuration
config = ListRenderConfig(
    max_visual_depth=7,  # Allow up to 7 nesting levels
    indent_inches_per_level=0.25,
    hanging_indent_inches=0.25,
    bullet_glyphs=("•", "◦", "▪", "▫", "▸", "▴", "▾"),
    deep_bullet_strategy="clamp_last",  # or "cycle" or "textual"
)

request = WordExportRequest(
    scalar_fields={"title": "Document with Deep Nesting"},
    block_fields={
        "content": """
# Deep Nested Lists

- Level 1
  - Level 2
    - Level 3
      - Level 4
        - Level 5
          - Level 6
            - Level 7
        """
    }
)

result = export_to_word(
    template_path=Path("template.docx"),
    request=request,
    markdown_mode=True,
    output_path=Path("output.docx"),
    config=config,
)
```

### JSON Input Example

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
from docx_template_export.models.export_models import WordExportRequest
from docx_template_export.services.word_export_service import export_to_word

# Load from JSON
with open("data.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

request = WordExportRequest(**data)

result = export_to_word(
    template_path=Path("template.docx"),
    request=request,
    markdown_mode=True,
    output_path=Path("output/exported_document.docx"),
)
```

Example `data.json`:
```json
{
  "scalar_fields": {
    "document_id": "DOC-12345",
    "title": "My Document",
    "author": "John Doe"
  },
  "block_fields": {
    "introduction": "# Introduction\n\nContent here...",
    "body": "## Body\n\nMore content...",
    "conclusion": "## Conclusion\n\nFinal thoughts..."
  }
}
```

## Template Placeholders

### Scalar Placeholders

Scalar placeholders are replaced with simple text values. You can use **any placeholder name** you want by adding it to `scalar_fields`:

```python
scalar_fields={
    "document_id": "DOC-123",
    "title": "My Document",
    "author": "John Doe",
    "custom_field": "Any value",
}
```

In your Word template, use `{{document_id}}`, `{{title}}`, `{{author}}`, `{{custom_field}}`, etc.

### Block Placeholders

Block placeholders are replaced with structured content (markdown or plain text). You can use **any placeholder name** you want by adding it to `block_fields`:

```python
block_fields={
    "introduction": "# Introduction\n\nContent...",
    "body": "## Body\n\nMore content...",
    "conclusion": "## Conclusion\n\nFinal thoughts...",
}
```

In your Word template, use `{{introduction}}`, `{{body}}`, `{{conclusion}}`, etc.

## Markdown Support

When `markdown_mode=True`, the following markdown structures are supported:

- **Headings**: `# H1`, `## H2`, etc. (up to H9)
- **Paragraphs**: Plain text paragraphs
- **Bullet lists**: `-` or `*` for unordered lists
- **Numbered lists**: `1.` for ordered lists
- **Tables**: Markdown table syntax
- **Inline formatting**: `**bold**` and `*italic*` text (in headings and paragraphs, not in table cells)
- **Fenced code blocks**: Triple backtick code blocks (e.g., ` ```python` ... ` ``` `) are rendered verbatim as plain text paragraphs
- **Inline code**: Backtick-wrapped code (e.g., `` `code` ``) is rendered as plain text with backticks removed
- **Blockquotes**: `>` prefixed paragraphs are rendered as regular paragraphs

### Code Blocks and Quotes

**Fenced Code Blocks**: Fenced code blocks are rendered verbatim with no escaping, validation, normalization, or correction applied. Quotes (single, double, escaped), apostrophes, backticks, and language-specific syntax are preserved exactly as provided. Invalid JSON, Python, or other code is rendered as-is without modification.

**Inline Code**: Inline code preserves text exactly. Backticks are markdown syntax and are not rendered literally in the output.

**Quotes**: Quotes inside normal text, blockquotes, and code blocks are preserved exactly. No smart-quote conversion or typography normalization is applied. The exporter does not modify punctuation.

### Table Behavior

- Inline markdown formatting inside table cells is treated as literal text.
- Tables prioritize structure and layout determinism over inline formatting.

## Output

The export function returns a dictionary with:

- `word_file_path`: Path to the generated DOCX file
- `markdown_files`: List containing the path to `exported_markdown_content.md` (empty if all blocks are empty)
- `export_summary`: (Optional) Export summary with audit trail when `enable_export_trace=True` (default)
- `export_summary_log_path`: (Optional) Path to saved log file when `enable_export_trace=True`

## Observability & Export Summary

The library provides comprehensive observability to track what happened during export execution. This includes:

- **Scalar replacements**: Which placeholders were replaced and where
- **Block replacements**: Which block placeholders were replaced and with what content types
- **Skipped items**: Which placeholders were detected but skipped, and why
- **Fallback events**: When fallback mechanisms were triggered (e.g., tree renderer → block renderer)
- **Warnings**: Safety warnings raised during export

### Quick Start

```python
result = export_to_word(
    template_path=Path("template.docx"),
    request=request,
    markdown_mode=True,
    output_path=Path("output.docx")
)

# Access export summary
if "export_summary" in result:
    summary = result["export_summary"]
    print(f"Scalar replacements: {len(summary['scalar_replacements'])}")
    print(f"Block replacements: {len(summary['block_replacements'])}")
    print(f"Skipped items: {len(summary['skipped_items'])}")
    
    # Log file path
    if "export_summary_log_path" in result:
        print(f"Log saved to: {result['export_summary_log_path']}")
```

### Log Directory Structure

Export summaries are automatically saved to timestamped directories:

```
{EXPORT_LOG_DIR}/logs/
  20240124_143022/
    export_summary_output.json
    export_trace_output.log
```

- Each export run gets its own timestamped directory
- Multiple exports in the same second share the same directory
- Logs are organized chronologically for easy navigation
- Both JSON summary and structured log file are saved automatically

### Environment Variables

Three environment variables control export behavior:

**`OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`**: Base directory for output files (introduced in v0.3.0)

- Default: Not set (output paths resolved relative to current working directory)
- If set: Relative `output_path` parameters are resolved relative to this directory
- If `output_path` is absolute, this variable is ignored (absolute paths are used as-is)
- Useful for centralizing all exported documents in a single location
- Example: `OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=/var/exports` → `output_path=Path("doc.docx")` becomes `/var/exports/doc.docx`

**`USE_MARKDOWN_TREE_RENDERER`**: Control tree-based rendering engine (enabled by default)

- Default: `True` (tree renderer is enabled by default)
- Set to `"false"`, `"0"`, or `"no"` to disable and use block-based rendering (legacy behavior)
- When enabled (default), block placeholders are processed using the tree-based renderer
- Tree renderer provides enhanced structure preservation for complex nested markdown
- Falls back to block-based renderer on parsing failures

**`EXPORT_LOG_DIR`**: Controls where export summary logs are saved

- If set: Logs saved to `{EXPORT_LOG_DIR}/logs/{timestamp}/`
- If not set: Logs saved to `{output_dir}/logs/{timestamp}/`

The library automatically loads `.env` files if `python-dotenv` is available.

#### Example `.env` Configuration

```bash
# Base directory for output files (relative paths resolved relative to this)
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY=/var/exports

# Tree renderer is enabled by default, but can be explicitly set:
USE_MARKDOWN_TREE_RENDERER=true

# Or disable to use block-based rendering (legacy behavior):
# USE_MARKDOWN_TREE_RENDERER=false

# Customize log directory
EXPORT_LOG_DIR=/path/to/logs
```

### Enable/Disable

Observability is **enabled by default** (`enable_export_trace=True`). To disable:

```python
request = WordExportRequest(
    scalar_fields={...},
    block_fields={...},
    enable_export_trace=False  # Disable observability
)
```

When disabled, no summary is collected, no structured logs are emitted, and no log files are created (near-zero overhead).

- API integration
- Testing guidance

## Content Fidelity

This module respects content fidelity: all text is preserved exactly as provided, with only structural transformations applied (markdown syntax → Word objects).

## Design Guarantees & Non-Goals

### Guarantees

- **Deterministic output**: Given the same input, the export produces identical Word documents across runs and platforms.
- **No Word numbering XML**: Lists are rendered using manual glyph/number insertion, avoiding Word's numbering system for cross-platform stability.
- **Cross-platform stability**: Output renders consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux Word viewers.
- **Exact text fidelity**: All text content is preserved exactly as provided, with no wording modifications.

### Non-Goals

- **Semantic AST reconstruction**: The engine does not attempt to reconstruct semantic markdown AST relationships in Word. Lists are rendered visually, not structurally linked.
- **Word auto-list compatibility**: Lists are not converted to Word's native list objects. This is intentional for stability and determinism.
- **Rich markdown inside tables**: Inline markdown formatting (bold, italic) inside table cells is not processed. Table cells contain literal text only.

## Versioning Strategy

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **PATCH** (0.1.x): Bug fixes, documentation improvements, internal optimizations
- **MINOR** (0.x.0): New features, enhancements, backward-compatible API additions
- **MAJOR** (x.0.0): Breaking changes, API modifications, changes to deterministic behavior

**Note:** v0.x indicates the API is still evolving. However, **deterministic behavior guarantees will NOT change without a major version bump**.

### Stability Contract

- Deterministic output behavior is guaranteed within the same major version
- API changes within the same major version maintain backward compatibility
- Breaking changes require a major version increment
