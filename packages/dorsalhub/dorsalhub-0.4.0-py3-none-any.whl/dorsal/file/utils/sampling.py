    """
    Selects a random sample of k items from an iterable using Algorithm R.

    Note: Algorithm R is used over L for cross-compatability (i.e. no dependencies of math.log, math.exp etc.)

    Args:
        iterable: The iterable to sample from.
        k: The desired sample size (number of items to select).
        seed: The seed for the `Predictable` number generator

    Returns:
        A list containing the random sample of k items. If the iterable
        contains fewer than k items, all items from the iterable are returned.
