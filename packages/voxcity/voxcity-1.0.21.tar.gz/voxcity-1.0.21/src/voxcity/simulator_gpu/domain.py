"""
Shared domain definition for simulator_gpu.

This module re-exports the Domain class from solar.domain for backward compatibility.
The main implementation is in simulator_gpu.solar.domain which includes:
- Domain class with full grid, terrain, building, and vegetation support
- Surfaces class for radiation calculations
- Surface extraction utilities
