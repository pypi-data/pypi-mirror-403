## Attributes {.doc-section .doc-section-attributes}

| Name                                 | Type         | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| EQUALITY_BY_ID_AND_FULL_REFERENCE    | [str](`str`) | Match confirmed by both unique identifier and complete reference data.      |
| EQUALITY_BY_ID                       | [str](`str`) | Match confirmed via unique identifier only.                                 |
| EQUALITY_BY_FULL_REFERENCE           | [str](`str`) | Match confirmed via complete reference data comparison.                     |
| PREDICTION_UNIQUE                    | [str](`str`) | A single high-confidence prediction was found.                              |
| PREDICTION_UNIQUE_AND_FULL_REFERENCE | [str](`str`) | A unique prediction that also matches the full reference.                   |
| TO_CHECK_PREDICTION_FULL             | [str](`str`) | Requires review; prediction exists with full reference but lacks certainty. |
| TO_CHECK_PREDICTION_MULTI            | [str](`str`) | Requires review; multiple conflicting predictions were found.               |
| TO_CHECK_PREDICTION_MULTI_FULL       | [str](`str`) | Requires review; multiple predictions found alongside full reference data.  |
| TO_CHECK_ORIGINAL                    | [str](`str`) | Requires review against the original source data.                           |
| TO_CHECK_NO_PREDICTION               | [str](`str`) | Requires review because no valid prediction could be generated.             |
| NOT_EVALUATED                        | [str](`str`) | The alignment has not yet been processed or evaluated.                      |
