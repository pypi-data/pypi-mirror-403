When creating a aligner you can define the crs you want to use. This has to be a projected coordinate system with units in **meter**. When loading data, you have to provide the data in this CRS. When on-the-fly dataloaders are used, they will try to download the data in the provided crs if available. if not available, an error is returned.\n\n## Which geometry types are supported?\n\n- Short answer: (Multi-)Points, (Multi-)LineStrings, and (Multi-)Polygons.\n- Long answer: **brdr** was initially started to align thematic (Multi-)Polygons to reference (Multi-)Polygons. Afterwards processors are added to also support (multi-)linestrings and (multi-)Points.\n\n## How to choose the best Processor for my data?\n\n- Short answer: AlignerGeometryProcessor (default) checks the type of your thematic & reference-data and uses the other Processors underneath. DieussaertGeometryProcessor is a quicker algoritm for aligning Polygons to Polygons. NetworkGeometryPorcessor can be used for all combinations of geometries (Points, Lines, Polygons), but has a longer calculation time.\n- Long answer: \n  - AlignerGeometryProcessor (default) is a wrapper around DieussaertGeometryProcessor & NetworkGeometryProcessor. It checks the geometry-types and uses the DieussaertGeometryProcessor if possible, otherwise NetworkGeometryProcessor.\n  - DieussaertGeometryProcessor: It is a using an algorithm based on buffers, relevant intersections and relevant differences. This is a quick algorithm, but can only be used to align polygon-to-polygon. For most of these cases this is the best option, in some edge cases some detail of the polygon can be simplified.\n  - NetworkGeometryProcessor: It is using an algorithm based on graphs/networks. This is the most generic processor as this can be used for all point-line-polygon combinations. However he calculation is much slower than Dieussaertprocessor.\n  - TopologyProcessor: This is an experimental processor and is a special usage of the NetworkGeometryProcessor. The thematic input geometries are 'converted' to their topolgical arcs, and these arcs are aligned with the NetworkGeometryProcessor. Afterwards the arcs are re-combined to get a result that keeps a topological relation with its neighbours.\n  \n  Summary; if you have polygon-to-polygon, start with DieussaertProcessor and see if these results fits your goal. If not, try NetworkGeometryProcessor\n\n## Does 'brdr' support 3D geometries ( & M/Z-coordinates)?\n\n- Short answer: No, it is currently 2D-only. (3D and M-Z values are not supported)\n- Long answer: The library is optimized for 2D alignment. If you provide geometries with M- or Z-coordinates, the alignment will be calculated based on the $X$ and $Y$ planes. M/Z-values are stripped.\n\n## Is topology preserved between the thematic geometries (input) ?\n\n- Short answer: No, but...\n- Long answer: Every thematic input geometry is processed individually to find a result/prediction. So there is no topology preserved between multiple thematic input geometries. However there is a TopologyGeometryProcessor (experimental) that searches for predictions for every thematic geometry, while trying to preserve topology between these geometries.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":false,"code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","highlight-style":"github-dark","embed-resources":false,"toc":true,"output-file":"qa.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
