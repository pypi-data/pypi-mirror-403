# weld research

Research a specification before planning.

## Usage

```bash
weld research <input> [OPTIONS]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `input` | Path to the specification file |

## Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--output` | `-o` | Path to write research (default: `.weld/research/`) |
| `--focus` | `-f` | Specific areas to focus on |
| `--quiet` | `-q` | Suppress streaming output |

## Description

Generates a research prompt and runs Claude to analyze:

- Architecture and existing patterns
- Dependencies and integration points
- Risks and open questions

## Examples

### Research a specification

```bash
weld research specs/feature.md
```

### Write to specific location

```bash
weld research specs/feature.md -o research.md
```

### Focus on specific concerns

```bash
weld research specs/feature.md --focus "security concerns"
```

### Suppress streaming output

```bash
weld research specs/feature.md -o research.md --quiet
```

## Output

Research output is written to `.weld/research/` by default with a timestamped filename.

## Input Validation

Before starting the (potentially expensive) Claude operation, weld validates inputs upfront:

- **File existence**: Verifies the input file exists
- **File type**: Ensures the path points to a file, not a directory
- **Output path**: If `--output` is specified, validates the path is writable

When validation fails, you'll see a clear error message with an actionable hint:

```
Error: specs/feature is a directory, expected a file
Hint: Provide a valid specification file path
```

This prevents wasted API tokens from invalid inputs.
