## [0.9.1] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- `weld plan` now accepts multiple specification files
  - Combines all specs into a single implementation plan
  - Usage: `weld plan spec1.md spec2.md spec3.md`

## [0.9.0] - 2026-01-17

### Added
- Early input validation with helpful error hints for all commands
  - Validates file paths before starting expensive operations (prevents wasted API tokens)
  - Clear error messages indicate what's wrong (e.g., "is a directory, expected a file")
  - Actionable hints suggest corrections (e.g., "Provide a file path: --output /path/output.md")
  - Applies to: `plan`, `research`, `discover`, `review`, `interview`, `implement`

### Changed
- `weld init` now adds simple `.weld/` entry to `.gitignore` instead of complex pattern
  - Previously used `.weld/*` with `!.weld/config.toml` exception to track config
  - Now ignores entire `.weld/` directory (config is local-only)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- `--autopilot` flag for `weld implement` command
  - Executes all plan steps automatically without user intervention
  - After each step: runs code review with auto-fix, then commits
  - Stops on first Claude failure
  - Designed for CI/automation and unattended execution

### Changed
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` now defaults to `True` for `weld plan` command
  - Plans are generated without permission prompts by default
  - Use `--no-dangerously-skip-permissions` to restore previous behavior
- All Claude CLI invocations now use `skip_permissions=True` for smoother automated workflows

### Fixed
- Plan prompt template restructured with explicit WRONG/CORRECT format examples
  - Shows concrete anti-pattern to avoid (bullet-point summaries)
  - Provides complete correct example with all required sections
  - Adds output format checklist as final reminder before generation
  - Explicitly forbids questions, follow-up options, and conversational closing
  - Clarifies CLI context: output goes directly to file, not interactive chat

## [0.7.1] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- `weld plan` now produces more consistent output following `docs/reference/plan-format.md`
  - Clearer template structure reduces Claude deviations from required format
  - Complete Phase 2 example ensures all phases get proper Goal/Files/Validation/Failure modes sections

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag for `weld plan` command
  - Allows Claude to explore codebase (read files, search patterns) during plan generation
  - Required when Claude needs file access to create comprehensive plans
  - Matches behavior of `weld implement` command
- `--no-review` flag for `weld implement` command
  - Skips post-step review prompt to avoid Claude CLI date serialization bugs
  - Workaround for "RangeError: Invalid time value" errors during review step
  - Useful when Claude CLI stats cache has issues
- Multiple transcript gist support in `weld commit` fallback mode
  - Now uploads separate gists for each session that contributed to staged files
  - Example: implement session + review session = 2 gists attached to commit
  - Each gist labeled with command type (implement, review, etc.)
  - Provides complete context for understanding changes
- Smart error recovery in `weld implement` command
  - When Claude crashes after making file changes, detects modifications and prompts user
  - Allows marking step as complete despite Claude error if work was actually done
  - Prevents losing progress when Claude has internal failures
  - Only prompts if file changes detected; genuine failures still return error

### Changed
- Enhanced `weld plan` prompt with 10 implementation plan rules
  - Monotonic phases, discrete steps, artifact-driven output
  - Explicit dependencies, vertical slices, invariants first
  - Test parallelism, rollback safety, bounded scope, execution ready
  - Rules condensed to minimize context usage while enforcing plan quality
- Optimized `weld implement` prompt to skip redundant test runs
  - When Claude identifies a step as already complete (but not marked), checks git status first
  - If worktree is clean: marks step complete without running tests
  - If worktree is dirty: reviews uncommitted changes and proceeds without re-running tests
  - Significant time savings when resuming after crashes or re-running completed steps

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Plan generation now strictly enforces required Phase → Step format
  - Added explicit format requirements to prompt to prevent conversational output
  - Added validation to reject plans that don't start with "## Phase" or lack steps
  - Fixed issue where Claude would output summaries/questions instead of structured plans
  - Plans now correctly follow docs/reference/plan-format.md specification
- **Critical**: `weld commit` now attaches transcripts from ALL relevant sessions
  - Fallback flow finds all sessions from registry that match staged files
  - Uploads one gist per matching session (e.g., implement + review)
  - Fixes issue where only one transcript was attached when multiple sessions contributed
  - Each transcript gets its own trailer line in commit message

## [0.6.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- Interactive review prompt after step completion in `weld implement` command
  - Prompts user to review changes with optional auto-fixing via `weld review --diff [--apply]`
  - Non-blocking: review failures don't stop implement flow
  - Always available (independent of --auto-commit flag)

### Fixed
- Interactive menu cursor position in `weld implement` - now automatically positions on first incomplete step
- Makefile `bin-install` target now forces package rebuild with `--force` flag to pick up source changes
- **Critical**: EOFError handling in auto-commit prompt (now handles non-interactive environments)
- **Critical**: File I/O error handling in review prompt (disk full/permission errors no longer crash)
- **Critical**: Exception handling for review prompt generation
- Directory naming for review artifacts (sanitize step numbers with dots, e.g., "1.2" → "1-2")
- Added model parameter to review Claude invocations (respects configured model)
- Removed redundant git status check in review prompt (performance improvement)
- Config validation with safe defaults for review feature (graceful handling of malformed configs)
- Result validation for empty Claude output in reviews
- Consistent error messages across all non-blocking failures
- Security documentation for `skip_permissions` behavior in review auto-fix mode

  - History tracking via simple JSONL files per command type
- Simplified CLI to 8 focused commands: `init`, `commit`, `plan`, `research`, `discover`, `interview`, `review`, `doctor`
- `weld commit` now automatically splits changes into logical commits

- History logging now stores commit message subject instead of diff snippet
- CHANGELOG staging now preserves user's partial staging (warns if already staged)
- Reduced models to just `DiscoverMeta`, `Issue`, and `Issues`

### Removed
- Run-centric workflow and all associated infrastructure:
  - Commands: `run`, `step`, `status`, `next`, `list`
  - Core modules: `run_manager`, `step_processor`, `loop`, `review_engine`, `plan_parser`, `commit_handler`, `lock_manager`, `artifact_versioning`, `research_processor`
  - Models: `Meta`, `Step`, `Status`, `Lock`, `Timing`, `VersionInfo`, `StaleOverride`, `CommandEvent`, `CategoryResult`, `ChecksSummary`
