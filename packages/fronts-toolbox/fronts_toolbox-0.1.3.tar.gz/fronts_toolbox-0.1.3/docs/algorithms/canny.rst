Canny Edge Detector
*******************

A classical edge detection method used in image processing and relying on
gradients. Based on |canny_1986|_.

The implementation is copied from that of `scikit-image
<https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/blob/main/skimage/feature/_canny.py>`__,
with minor adjustments to make it more flexible.

.. important::

   The implementation does not include the typical Gaussian filter. This allows
   to apply (or not) any filter that may not smooth features as much.

Definition
==========

Filtering
---------

Because this is a gradient based approach, it is a good idea to smooth out the
noise in the input field. This is typically done with a Gaussian filter. Here
this implementation **does not do any filtering** so that you can choose the
filter you deem the most appropriate.

Non-maximal suppression
-----------------------

The gradient magnitude and direction is computed using a 3x3 Sobel operator.
The mask of non-valid pixels is eroded accordingly. The borders are masked
as well.

Potential edges are then thinned to 1-pixel width. This is done by finding the
normal to the edge at each point by looking at the x and y components of the
gradient. The edge can be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or anti-diagonal.

The central pixel is **not** kept if the gradient at neighboring pixels in the
normal or reverse directions is greater than its own. The gradient in those
directions is computed by interpolating the values from a selection of the 8
closest neighbors.

See the implementation at
https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/blob/main/skimage/feature/_canny_cy.pyx.

Hysteresis or double-thresholding
---------------------------------

Edges are considered as *weak* or *strong* based on the gradient magnitude and
two thresholds given by the user.

.. note::

   If not given, the thresholds are taken as 10% and 20% of the input dtype
   maximum value.

   If ``use_quantiles=True``, the given values are taken as the quantiles of the
   image gradient magnitude.

Strong edges are all kept. Weak edges are kept only if they are recursively
8-connected to a strong edge. Meaning any weak edge that has a strong edge in at
least one of its 8 closest neighbors is kept and now-considered as a strong edge
(so weak edges connected to it will be kept as well etc.).

This step may make sense in the context of image processing, but not so much
when detecting oceanic fronts. For that reason, it is possible to omit that step
by passing ``hysteresis=False``. In this case, both weak and strong edges are
kept.

.. important::

   The hysteresis can have non-local effects (a weak edge is affected by a
   strong edge at the other end of the image if they are connected). It cannot
   be applied to a Dask array that is chunked along one of the core dimension.
   Rechunk beforehand, for instance if using Xarray::

     input_field = input_field.chunk(lon=-1, lat=-1)
