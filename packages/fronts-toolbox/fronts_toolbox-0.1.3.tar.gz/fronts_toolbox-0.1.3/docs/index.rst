..

   Collection of tools to detect oceanic fronts in Python.

Despite being widely used in the literature, some front-detection algorithms are
not easily available in Python. This packages implements different methods
directly in Python: they are accelerated by `Numba
<https://numba.pydata.org/>`__ and support Numpy arrays, `Dask
<https://dask.org/>`__ arrays, or `Xarray <https://xarray.dev/>`__ data. Support
for Cuda array could be added if necessary.

The goal of this package is to provide various methods in such a way that they
can be easily read and modified by researchers. In that regard, Numba allows to
write directly in Python and retain access to a lot of functions from Numpy and
Scipy. This package provides a common framework to easily add other algorithms,
while benefiting from automatic testing and documentation.

Install
=======

From PyPI::

  pip install fronts-toolbox

From source::

   git clone https://github.com/Descanonge/fronts-toolbox
   cd fronts-toolbox
   pip install -e .

Testing
=======

Testing these various front-detection algorithms automatically is not
straightforward. Only basic automatic tests are run: the functions terminate
without crashing, the output is the correct type and shape, the output is not
all invalid. Checking the correctness of the methods is left to the user. The
documentation includes a gallery that is automatically constructed and allows to
visually check the methods.

Checking the results is especially important when dealing with Dask and chunked
core dimensions.

.. important::

   I am doing this on the side. I do not have the time to thoroughly test every
   algorithm with actual data (beyond the gallery).
