# Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Chemistry (QDK/Chemistry)

QDK/Chemistry is an open-source C++ and Python package within the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK)](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk).
It provides an end-to-end toolkit for quantum chemistry:  from molecular setup and Hamiltonian generation to quantum algorithm execution and results analysis.
Designed for seamless integration with existing Python and chemistry workflows, QDK Chemistry enables researchers to simulate and run problems on near-term quantum hardware, explore strongly correlated systems, and advance toward practical quantum chemistry applications.

## Overview

QDK/Chemistry provides a comprehensive suite of tools for:

- Molecular structure representation and manipulation
- Molecular orbital calculations and analysis
- Basis set management
- Configuration and settings management
- High-performance quantum algorithms

## Documentation

- **Website**: The full documentation is hosted [online](https://microsoft.github.io/qdk-chemistry/index.html)
- **C++ API**: Headers in [`cpp/include/`](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-chemistry/tree/main/cpp/include) contain comprehensive Doxygen documentation
- **Python API**: All methods include detailed docstrings with Parameters, Returns, Raises, and Examples sections
- **Examples**: See the [`examples/`](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-chemistry/tree/main/examples) directory and [documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/qdk-chemistry/index.html) for usage examples


## Installing

Detailed instructions for installing QDK/Chemistry can be found in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-chemistry/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

## Telemetry

By default, this library collects anonymous usage and performance data to help improve the user experience and product quality. The telemetry implementation can be found in [telemetry.py](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-chemistry/blob/main/python/src/qdk_chemistry/utils/telemetry.py) and all telemetry events are defined in [telemetry_events.py](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-chemistry/blob/main/python/src/qdk_chemistry/utils/telemetry_events.py).

To disable telemetry via bash, set the environment variable `QSHARP_PYTHON_TELEMETRY` to one of the following values: `none`, `disabled`, `false`, or `0`. For example:

```bash
export QSHARP_PYTHON_TELEMETRY='false'
```

Alternatively, telemetry can be disabled within a python script by including the following at the top of the `.py` file:

```python
import os
os.environ["QSHARP_PYTHON_TELEMETRY"] = "disabled"
```

If you have any questions about the library's use of Telemetry, please use the [Discussion forum](https://github.com/microsoft/qdk-chemistry/discussions).
