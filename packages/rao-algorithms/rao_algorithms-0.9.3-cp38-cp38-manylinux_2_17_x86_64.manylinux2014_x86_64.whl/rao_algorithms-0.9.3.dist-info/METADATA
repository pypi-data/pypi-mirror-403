# Optimization Algorithms by Prof. R.V. Rao

This package implements several powerful optimization algorithms developed by Prof. Ravipudi Venkata Rao:
- **BMR (Best-Mean-Random) Algorithm**
- **BWR (Best-Worst-Random) Algorithm**
- **Jaya Algorithm**
- **Rao Algorithms (Rao-1, Rao-2, Rao-3)**
- **TLBO (Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization) Algorithm**
- **QOJAYA (Quasi-Oppositional Jaya) Algorithm**
- **GOTLBO (Generalized Oppositional TLBO) Algorithm**
- **ITLBO (Improved TLBO) Algorithm**
- **Multi-objective TLBO Algorithm**

These algorithms are designed to solve both **constrained** and **unconstrained** optimization problems without relying on metaphors or algorithm-specific parameters. The BMR and BWR algorithms are based on the paper:

**Ravipudi Venkata Rao and Ravikumar Shah (2024)**, "BMR and BWR: Two simple metaphor-free optimization algorithms for solving real-life non-convex constrained and unconstrained problems." [arXiv:2407.11149v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11149).

## Algorithms Overview

### BMR (Best-Mean-Random) Algorithm

The BMR algorithm is based on the best, mean, and random solutions from the population. It works by updating solutions based on their interaction with these key elements.

- **Paper Citation**: R. V. Rao, R. Shah, *BMR and BWR: Two simple metaphor-free optimization algorithms*. [arXiv:2407.11149v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11149).

### BWR (Best-Worst-Random) Algorithm

The BWR algorithm updates solutions by considering the best, worst, and random solutions in the population. The algorithm balances exploration and exploitation through these interactions.

- **Paper Citation**: R. V. Rao, R. Shah, *BMR and BWR: Two simple metaphor-free optimization algorithms*. [arXiv:2407.11149v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11149).

### Jaya Algorithm

The Jaya algorithm is a parameter-free algorithm that always tries to move toward the best solution and away from the worst solution. The name "Jaya" means "victory" in Sanskrit.

- **Paper Citation**: R. V. Rao, "Jaya: A simple and new optimization algorithm for solving constrained and unconstrained optimization problems", International Journal of Industrial Engineering Computations, 7(1), 2016, 19-34.

### Rao Algorithms (Rao-1, Rao-2, Rao-3)

The Rao algorithms are a family of three metaphor-less optimization algorithms. Each algorithm uses a different strategy to guide the search process:
- **Rao-1**: Uses the best solution and solution comparison
- **Rao-2**: Uses the best, worst, and average fitness
- **Rao-3**: Uses the best solution and a phase factor

- **Paper Citation**: R. V. Rao, "Rao algorithms: Three metaphor-less simple algorithms for solving optimization problems", International Journal of Industrial Engineering Computations, 11(2), 2020, 193-212.

### TLBO (Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization)

TLBO is a parameter-free algorithm inspired by the teaching-learning process in a classroom. It consists of two phases: Teacher Phase and Learner Phase.

- **Paper Citation**: R. V. Rao, V. J. Savsani, D. P. Vakharia, "Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization: An optimization method for continuous non-linear large scale problems", Information Sciences, 183(1), 2012, 1-15.

### QOJAYA (Quasi-Oppositional Jaya) Algorithm

QOJAYA enhances the standard Jaya algorithm by incorporating quasi-oppositional learning to improve convergence speed and solution quality. It generates and evaluates quasi-opposite solutions alongside the standard Jaya updates.

- **Paper Citation**: R. V. Rao, D. P. Rai, "Optimization of welding processes using quasi-oppositional-based Jaya algorithm", Journal of Mechanical Science and Technology, 31(5), 2017, 2513-2522.
- **Real-world Application**: The algorithm has been successfully applied to optimize welding processes, including tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding and friction stir welding. It determines optimal parameters like welding current, voltage, and speed to maximize weld strength while minimizing defects.

### GOTLBO (Generalized Oppositional TLBO) Algorithm

GOTLBO combines TLBO with generalized opposition-based learning to enhance exploration capabilities and convergence speed. It applies opposition in both teacher and learner phases.

- **Paper Citation**: R. V. Rao, V. Patel, "An improved teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm for solving unconstrained optimization problems", Scientia Iranica, 20(3), 2013, 710-720.
- **Real-world Application**: GOTLBO has been applied to mechanical design optimization problems, including the design of pressure vessels, spring design, and gear train design. It effectively finds optimal dimensions and parameters that minimize weight while satisfying safety constraints.

### ITLBO (Improved TLBO) Algorithm

ITLBO enhances the standard TLBO algorithm with an adaptive teaching factor, elite solution influence, and three-way interaction in the learner phase.

- **Paper Citation**: R. V. Rao, V. Patel, "An elitist teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm for solving complex constrained optimization problems", International Journal of Industrial Engineering Computations, 3(4), 2012, 535-560.
- **Real-world Application**: ITLBO has been successfully applied to optimize heat exchangers, finding the optimal design parameters that maximize heat transfer while minimizing pressure drop and material costs. It has also been used for power system optimization to minimize generation costs and transmission losses.

### Multi-objective TLBO Algorithm

Multi-objective TLBO extends TLBO to handle multiple competing objectives using Pareto dominance and crowding distance for selection. It returns a set of non-dominated solutions (Pareto front).

- **Paper Citation**: R. V. Rao, V. D. Kalyankar, "Multi-objective TLBO algorithm for optimization of modern machining processes", Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing, 236, 2014, 21-31.
- **Real-world Application**: The algorithm has been applied to optimize machining processes like turning, milling, and grinding operations. It simultaneously optimizes multiple objectives such as surface roughness, material removal rate, and tool wear, helping manufacturers achieve high-quality parts with efficient production.

## Convergence History Tracking

The `run_optimization` function now supports tracking the convergence history of the optimization process. This feature can be enabled by setting the `track_history` parameter to `True`. The convergence history is returned as a dictionary containing the following keys:

- `best_scores`: A list of the best scores found at each iteration.
- `best_solutions`: A list of the best solutions found at each iteration.
- `population_diversity`: A list of the population diversity at each iteration.
- `iteration_times`: A list of the time taken by each iteration.

## Docker Support

You can use the included `Dockerfile` to build and test the package quickly. To build and run the package in Docker:

```bash
docker build -t optimization-algorithms .
docker run -it optimization-algorithms
```
