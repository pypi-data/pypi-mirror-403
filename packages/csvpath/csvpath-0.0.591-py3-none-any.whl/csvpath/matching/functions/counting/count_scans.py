                    Scanning predicts a specific number of lines for a given file. However,
                    if a line is expected to be scanned but is skipped because it is blank
                    it is not counted as scanned.

                    For example, a scanning instruction [1-3] indicates that lines 1, 2, and 3 would
                    be scanned. But if line 2 is blank and we are configured to skip blank lines (the
                    default), when we're done scanning we will have a count_scans() total of 2, not 3, because
                    we skipped a blank line.
