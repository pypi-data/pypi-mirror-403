                        When stop contains another match component, stop() is conditional to its
                        evaluation. In this way stop() functions like a when/do expression.

                        csvpath from being evaluated. Match components that come earlier in the

                        qualifier are evaluated at the end of the csvpath, and so might not be
                        evaluated when stop() happens even if they come before stop().
