            Imports one csvpath into another. The imported csvpath's match
            components are copied into the importing csvpath. Scan instructions are
            not imported.

            Using import() can help with clarity, consistency, efficiency through
            reuse, and testing.

            Import parses both csvpaths, validates both, then puts the two together
            with the imported csvpath running just before where the import function
            was placed. Once the second csvpath has been imported it is as if you
            had written all the match components in the same place.

            Keep in mind that in CsvPath Language, order matters. Import may come
            at any point in a csvpath, allowing you to managed ordering. Remember that
            the onmatch qualifier reorders match components so that those with onmatch
            are evaluted after those without onmatch.

            import() only works in the context of a CsvPaths instance. CsvPaths manages
            finding the imported csvpath. You make the import using a named-paths name,
            optionally with a specific csvpath identity within the named-paths group.

            Named-paths names point to a set of csvpaths. You can point to the csvpath you
            want to import in two ways:

            - Using a reference in the form $named-paths-name.csvpaths.csvpath-identity

            - Giving a named-path name, optionally with a # and the identity of a specific csvpath

            If you plan to import, remember to give your csvpaths an identity in the
            comments using the id or name metadata keys.

            You can import csvpaths from the same named-paths group. That means you could
            even put all your csvpaths in one file and have them import each other as needed.
            When you do this you will still be running the whole named-paths group as a unit.
            Because of that, the csvpaths you import could be run twice. You can prevent that
            by setting the run-mode of the imported csvpaths to no-run.
