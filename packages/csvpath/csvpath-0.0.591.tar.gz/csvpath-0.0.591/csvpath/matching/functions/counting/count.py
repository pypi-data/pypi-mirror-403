                Returns the number of matches.

                When used alone count() gives the total matches seen up to the current line in the file.

                Matches can be scoped down to a contained existence test or equality.
                Counting an equality means a function, term, variable, or header compared
                to another function, term, variable, or header.

                When count() is scoped to its contained value, the count is of the values seen.
                If it is a bool, the count is the number of Trues and the number of Falses.
                If an int, it is a count of each value seen.

                For example, take count( empty( #zipcode ) )

                This use of count() counts the number of times it sees True and False. Whereas, count( #zipcode )
                Counts the number of times each value of zipcode is seen.

                When counting the values it sees, count() stores the value-integer pairs in
                a variable under a key identifying the count function. The ID of the count
                function is a hash by default, making it difficult for a human to understand
                which count the key represents. To name the count use a qualifier count().

                A name qualifier is a name that follows the function name separated by a
                dot. For example: count.red_cars(#0="red").

                count() can take the onmatch qualifier. When there is a contained value and
                onmatch, count only increments if its contained value matches. For example:
                $[*][count.onmatch( in(#firstname,"Bug|Bird|Ants") ) == 2]

                This path counts first names that match the in() function. If the count equals
                2 the row will also match. This is a different behavior from that of other match
                components in that count is using onmatch to look inward, rather than at its
                siblings. Bear in mind, count() without a contained value only increments
                when the row matches. In that case, onmatch would add nothing.
