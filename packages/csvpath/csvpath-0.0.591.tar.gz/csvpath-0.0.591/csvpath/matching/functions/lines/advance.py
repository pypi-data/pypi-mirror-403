                        advance() is similar to skip(). skip() cuts-short the processing of its line and

                        skipped will not be considered or collected as matched or unmatched.

                        advance_all() has the additional functionality of advancing all csvpaths
                        running breadth-first.

                        Csvpaths running breadth-first are in a named-paths group run
                        that was started using the collect_by_line(), fast_forward_by_line(), or
                        next_by_line() methods on the CsvPaths class.

                        advance_all() is similar to skip(). Acting in just one csvpath, skip()
                        cuts-short the processing of its line and jumps to the next line.
                        advance_all(), like advance(), finishes the line it is on within its
                        csvpath before jumping over the next N-lines.

                        However, similar to skip(), advance_all() stops the line it is evaluated
                        on from being fully considered because in a breadth-first run each csvpath
                        evaluates a line before the next line is started. advance_all() prevents
                        downstream csvpaths from seeing the line.

                        For example, take two csvpaths in a named-paths group that
                        was run using fast_forward_by_line(). If the first csvpath
                        uses a when/do operator to evaluate advance_all() on the odd lines, the
                        second csvpath will only see the even lines.
