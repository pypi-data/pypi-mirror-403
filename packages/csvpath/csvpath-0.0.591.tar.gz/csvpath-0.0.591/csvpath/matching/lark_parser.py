    """LarkParser implements the match part of CsvPath. is the replacement for the
    original Ply parser. It offers easier control of the grammar and a more
    intuitative way of building the parse tree. until 1.0 all of the four parsers
    in CsvPath should be considered under active development."""

    # REFERENCE is underspecified. we need to get closer to the references
    # we use in queries. this just has a $with .s and alphanums. that is
    # so far off it gets in the way of switching to using the reference
    # finders under the hood.
    #
    # as a bare start, adding : and -
    #
    # question is, are we going to bring the whole reference grammar in here
    # or just add that as a post processing step, kind of like the print()
    # parser?
