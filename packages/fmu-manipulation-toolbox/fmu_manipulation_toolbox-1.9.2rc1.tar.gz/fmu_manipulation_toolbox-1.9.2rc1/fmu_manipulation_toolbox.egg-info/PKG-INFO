FMU Manipulation Toolbox is a python package which helps to analyze, modify or combine
[Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs)](https://fmi-standard.org/) without recompilation. It is highly customizable and comes with
a Python API.

FMU Manipulation Toolbox can be used in different ways:
- Using a Graphical User Interface: suitable for end users
- Using a Command Line Interface: useful for scripting and automation
- Using a Python API: the most efficient option for automation (CI/CD, transformation scripts, ...))

Major features:
- Analyze FMU content: list ports and their attributes, check compliance of `ModelDescription.xml` with XSD, etc.
- Alter FMU by modifying its `modelDescription.xml` file. NOTE: manipulating this file can be a risky.
  When possible, it is preferable to communicate with the FMU developer and adapt the FMU generation process.
- Add binary interfaces. Typical use case is porting a 32-bit FMUs to 64-bit systems (or vice et versa). 
- Combine FMUs into [FMU Containers](doc/container.md) and allow your favourite FMI tool to orchestrate complex assembly of FMUs.

FMI versions 2.0 and 3.0 are supported.
