class Truncation:
    """
    Truncation strategy for Pauli expansion operations.
    
    Truncation can be applied during gate application or as a standalone operation
    to reduce the number of terms in a Pauli expansion. Multiple truncation criteria
    can be specified together; terms are removed if they fail any criterion.
    
    Args:
        pauli_weight_cutoff: Maximum Pauli weight (number of non-identity Paulis) to keep.
            Terms with Pauli weight (non-identity Pauli operators) greater than this value are removed. If None, no weight-based
            truncation is applied.
        pauli_coeff_cutoff: Minimum absolute coefficient value to keep. Terms with
            ``|coefficient| < pauli_coeff_cutoff`` are removed. If None, no coefficient-based
            truncation is applied.
    
    Example:
        >>> # Keep only terms with weight <= 3 and |coef| >= 1e-10
        >>> truncation = Truncation(pauli_weight_cutoff=3, pauli_coeff_cutoff=1e-10)
        >>> result = expansion.apply_gate(gate, truncation=truncation)
        
        >>> # Only weight-based truncation
        >>> truncation = Truncation(pauli_weight_cutoff=5)
        
        >>> # Only coefficient-based truncation
        >>> truncation = Truncation(pauli_coeff_cutoff=1e-8)
