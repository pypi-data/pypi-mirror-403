**Convert your draw.io diagrams to PowerPoint presentations!** 🎨➡️📊

## 📖 Overview

drawio2pptx is a Python package that converts draw.io (diagrams.net) files to PowerPoint (.pptx) presentations. It performs conversion from **mxGraph** (the underlying format used by draw.io) to **PresentationML** (the XML format used by PowerPoint).

**Important**: One draw.io file corresponds to one PowerPoint presentation. Each page/diagram within the draw.io file becomes a separate slide in the resulting PowerPoint presentation.

## ✨ Features

### 🔧 Core Functionality
- ✅ Convert draw.io files (.drawio, .xml) to PowerPoint (.pptx)
- ✅ **One file = One presentation**: One draw.io file becomes one PowerPoint presentation
- ✅ **One page/diagram = One slide**: Each page/diagram in a draw.io file becomes a separate slide
- ✅ Support for multiple pages/diagrams in a single file
- ✅ Automatic page size configuration (pageWidth, pageHeight)

### 🔷 Shape Support
- **Basic shapes**: Rectangle, Square, Ellipse, Circle, Rounded Rectangle
- **Polygons**: Triangle, Right Triangle, Hexagon, Octagon, Pentagon, Rhombus, Parallelogram, Trapezoid, Star (4/5/6/8-point)
- **3D shapes**: Cylinder
- **Flowchart shapes**: Process, Decision, Document, Predefined Process, Internal Storage, Punched Tape, Stored Data, Cloud
- **Connectors/Edges**: Straight lines, Orthogonal connectors with arrow support

### 🎨 Styling & Formatting
- **Colors**: Hexadecimal (#RRGGBB), Short hex (#RGB), RGB format, light-dark format

## 📦 Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- **python-pptx >= 0.6.21**: Used for creating and writing PowerPoint (.pptx) files in PresentationML format
- **lxml >= 4.6.0**: Used for parsing and processing XML/mxGraph data from draw.io files, and for directly editing PresentationML XML elements that are not supported by python-pptx (e.g., gradients, highlights, advanced styling)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install python-pptx lxml
```

### Install as Package (Development Mode)

Install the package in development mode to use the `drawio2pptx` command:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Or install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install drawio2pptx
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Command Line Interface

After installation, use the `drawio2pptx` command:

```bash
drawio2pptx sample.drawio sample.pptx
```

### Example

```bash
drawio2pptx sample.drawio sample.pptx

If the command is not found, you can run it as a Python module:

```bash
python -m drawio2pptx.main sample.drawio sample.pptx
```

### Analysis Mode

You can use the `--analyze` (or `-a`) option to display analysis results after conversion:

```bash
drawio2pptx sample.drawio sample.pptx --analyze
```
