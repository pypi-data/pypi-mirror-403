**TorchLingo** is an educational PyTorch library for Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Designed for students and instructors, it provides a clean, well-documented implementation of the Transformer architecture for learning and experimentation.

## Features

- 🎓 **Educational Focus**: Clean, readable code designed for learning
- 🔄 **Transformer Architecture**: Full encoder-decoder implementation with multi-head attention
- 📝 **SentencePiece Tokenization**: BPE and Unigram subword models
- 🔁 **Back-Translation**: Data augmentation for improved translation quality
- 🌍 **Multilingual Support**: Train a single model for multiple language pairs
- 📊 **TensorBoard Integration**: Monitor training progress in real-time

## Installation

```bash
pip install torchlingo
```

For development:

```bash
pip install torchlingo[dev]
```
