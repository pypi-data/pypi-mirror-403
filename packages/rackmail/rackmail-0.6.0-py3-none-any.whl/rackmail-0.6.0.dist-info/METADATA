## ⚙️ Configuration
You will need information from your Rackspace Hosted Email tenant to fully setup this tool. Since this tool uses the Rackspace API, you can find most of this information in the API Key's section of Rackspace's Admin console.

2. ```Customer ID```
3. ```X-Api-Signature Header```

To get the correct X-API-Signature Header. Please use rackmailcli as the useragent header.

After you get the three items listed above, you need to setup the environment on your machine. Please use the following key value pairs in your environment. Replacing the values of each with the values you got from Rackspace's admin console.

1. ```RACKSPACE_API_KEY = User Key```
2. ```RACKSPACE_CUSTOMER_ID = Customer ID```
3. ```RACKSPACE_API_HEADER = X-Api-Signature Header```
