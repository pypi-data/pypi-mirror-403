"""
ICoCo compatible interface to couple the visualizer to other codes using the coupling tool C3PO

ICOCO interface API:
https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/icoco-coupling

C3PO coupling tool:
https://github.com/code-coupling/c3po


The process threads structure of a coupling with the visualiser works as follow:


|             C3PO used process               |   Slave 1 process  |
|   C3PO Thread     -       Visualizer thread |   Slave 1 thread   |

        *
            C3PO objects, and drivers creation
        *   --------------------------------------->    *
            For each Visualization panel, a new process is created with a slave that will provide the data to the visualizer (1 in this example)

        *
            GridStackDriver initialisation
        *   ------------------->    *
            pn.serve() -> creation of the visualizer thread
                                    *   ----------->    *
                                    *   <-----------    *
            At each update of a panel (requested by the visualizer thread, on a button clic for example), an exchange of request is done between the visualizer thread and its associated thread.
                                    *
            The visualizer thread can then request itself to update the visualizer at the end of the tick based on the data received from the slave.

        *   --------------------------------------->    *
            At each setInputMedFieldDouble call, the C3PO thread provides the slave associated to the field the new version of the field.
        *
            If the C3PO Thread requests an update to the Visualizer, in the end, the C3PO Thread requests a plot update, two cases:
                -   The C3PO Thread doesn't have the hand on the plots, throwing an exception;
                -   The C3PO Thread adds a task, it is not read by the Visualizer thread, therefore not updating.

                                    *
            The visualizer update has to come from the Visualizer thread to be able to work:
                -   A play button was added, if clicked, a periodic task is added (from the Visualizer thread which handles the GUI) every second to refresh the visualization;
                -   The C3PO Thread will set a boolean to mark the need for an update;
                -   At each periodic task, if the boolean is at True, the Visualizer thread refreshes the geometry
