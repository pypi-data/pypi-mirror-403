# oeleo app

This app example uses the `oeleo` `ssh_worker` (see the script `oa.py` for details.)

## Build app with pyinstaller

### Create a win desktop app for Oeleo

The app requires `pystray` so you have to make sure it is available in your environment:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras

```


Easiest way to build an app is to use the auto-py-to-exe tool.

```bash
uv add --dev auto-py-to-exe

```

### run the tool (dont use py3.10.0 - it has a bug)
```bash
uv run auto-py-to-exe

```

There should also be a config.json file in the app folder. This is the config file for the auto-py-to-exe tool.
You can load it in the through the Settings menu in the tool.

### Installing using pyinstaller

You need the full path to the oeleo.ico file. This is located in the app directory.
You can run pyinstaller through auto-py-to-exe after all the settings are inserted (for example by loading config.json).

The pyinstaller command should be something like this:

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --icon "<full path to oeleo.ico>" --name "<name-of-the-app>" --hidden-import "pystray._win32 oa.pyw"  "<full path to the script oa.pyw>"
```

Here is how it looks on my computer:

```bash
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --icon "C:\scripting\oeleo\app\oeleo.ico" --name "oeleo_runner" --hidden-import "pystray._win32"  "C:\scripting\oeleo\app\oa.pyw"
```

Note! it will end up in the dist folder by default (so you need to manually move it to another place if you want it to be versioned).

### Checking installation

Move the "start.exe" file to the check folder. Make sure you have a valid ".env" file (use the "example.env" file as "template") in the same folder as "start.exe"

The ".env" must contain enough information so that it can succesfully connect to your server:

```r
OELEO_BASE_DIR_FROM=C:\scripting\oeleo\check\from
OELEO_BASE_DIR_TO=/somewher_in_myserver
OELEO_FILTER_EXTENSION=.xyz
OELEO_DB_NAME=test_app.db
OELEO_LOG_DIR=log
OELEO_EXTERNAL_HOST=A-IP-NUMBER
OELEO_USERNAME=coolkid
OELEO_PASSWORD=
OELEO_KEY_FILENAME=C:\Users\coolkid\.ssh\id_myserver
