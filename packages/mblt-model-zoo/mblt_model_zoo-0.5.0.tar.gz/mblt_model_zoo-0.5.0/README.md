**mblt-model-zoo** is a curated collection of AI models optimized by [Mobilint](https://www.mobilint.com/)’s Neural Processing Units (NPUs).

Designed to help developers accelerate deployment, Mobilint's Model Zoo offers access to public, pre-trained, and pre-quantized models for vision, language, and multimodal tasks. Along with performance results, we provide pre- and post-processing tools to help developers evaluate, fine-tune, and integrate the models with ease.

## Quick Start Guide

### Initializing Quantized Model Class

**mblt-model-zoo** provides a quantized model with associated pre- and post-processing tools. The following code snippet shows how to use the pre-trained model for inference.

```python
from mblt_model_zoo.vision import ResNet50

# Load the pre-trained model. 
# Automatically download the model if not found in the local cache.
resnet50 = ResNet50() 

# Load the model trained with a different recipe
# Currently, the default is "DEFAULT", or "IMAGENET1K_V1".
resnet50 = ResNet50(model_type = "IMAGENET1K_V2")

# Download the model to local directory and load it
resnet50 = ResNet50(local_path = "path/to/local/") # the file will be downloaded to "path/to/local/model.mxq"

# Load the model from a local path or download as filename and file path you want
resnet50 = ResNet50(local_path = "path/to/local/model.mxq")

# Set inference mode for better performance
# Aries supports "single", "multi", "global", "global4", and "global8" inference mode. Default is "global"
resnet50 = ResNet50(infer_mode = "global")

# (Beta) If you are holding a model compiled for Regulus, enable inference on the Regulus device.
resnet50 = ResNet50(product = "regulus")

# In summary, the model can be loaded with the following arguments. 
# You may customize those arguments to work with Mobilint's NPU.
resnet50 = ResNet50(
    local_path = None,
    model_type = "DEFAULT",
    infer_mode = "global",
    product = "aries",
)

```

### Working with Quantized Model

With the image given as a path, PIL image, numpy array, or torch tensor, you can perform inference with the quantized model. The following code snippet shows how to use the quantized model for inference:

```python
image_path = "path/to/image.jpg"

input_img = resnet50.preprocess(image_path) # Preprocess the input image
output = resnet50(input_img) # Perform inference with the quantized model
result = resnet50.postprocess(output) # Postprocess the output

result.plot(
    source_path=image_path,
    save_path="path/to/save/result.jpg",
)
```

### Listing Available Models

**mblt-model-zoo** offers a function to list all available models. You can use the following code snippet to list the models for a specific task (e.g., image classification, object detection, etc.):

```python
from mblt_model_zoo.vision import list_models
from pprint import pprint

available_models = list_models()
pprint(available_models)
```

## Model List

We provide the models that are quantized with our advanced quantization techniques. A list of available vision models is [here](mblt_model_zoo/vision/README.md).

## Optional Extras

When working with tasks other than vision, extra dependencies may be required. Those options can be installed via `pip install mblt-model-zoo[NAME]` or `pip install -e .[NAME]`.

Currently, these optional functions are only available on environment equipped with Mobilint's [Aries](https://www.mobilint.com/aries).

|Name|Use|Details|
|-------|------|------|
|transformers|For using HuggingFace transformers related models|[README.md](mblt_model_zoo/transformers/README.md) |

## Verbose Option

By default, model initialization stays quiet. To print the model file size and MD5 hash whenever an MXQ model loads, set the environment variable `MBLT_MODEL_ZOO_VERBOSE` to a truthy value before running your script:

```bash
export MBLT_MODEL_ZOO_VERBOSE=true  # accepted values: true/1/yes/on (case-insensitive)
python your_script.py
```

Unset or set the variable to any other value to suppress these messages.
