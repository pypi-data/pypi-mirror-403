# solidflow

Unified, structured LLM calls for OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Anthropic, and OpenRouter.

## API keys
Set environment variables:
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- GEMINI_API_KEY (or GOOGLE_API_KEY)
- MISTRAL_API_KEY
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY
If a `.env` file is present in the working directory, it is loaded automatically
without overriding existing environment variables.

## Call logging
- LLM call timing records are always captured; access in-process via `solidflow.get_llm_call_records()`.
- Persist records by setting `SOLIDFLOW_LLM_CALL_RECORDS_DIR` or calling `solidflow.set_llm_call_records_dir(...)`
  (records are appended to `llm_call_records.jsonl` in that folder).
- To visualize, run `python scripts/export_llm_calls.py` then open `scripts/llm_calls.html` in a browser.
