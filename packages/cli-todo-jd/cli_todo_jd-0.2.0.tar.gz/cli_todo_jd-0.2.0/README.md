# cli-todo-jd

A command line to do list with interactive menu

## What is`cli-todo-jd`?

This is a command line interface todo list. Once installed, there are two ways to interact 
with the list. 

### `todo_menu`

Once installed use `todo_menu` to launch into the interactive menu. From here you can add,
remove, list, or clear your todo list. Items in your list are stored (by default) as
`.todo_list.json`. The menu does also support optional filepaths using `-f` or `--filepath`.


### interacting with todo list without menu

Alternately you can interact directly using the following commands (`--filepath can be substituted for -f`)

- `todo_add text --filepath optional_path_to_json` used to add an item to your list
- `todo_remove index --filepath optional_path_to_json` used to remove item number `index`
- `todo_list --filepath optional_path_to_json` used to view list
- `todo_clear --filepath optional_path_to_json` used to clear list (prompts y/n to confirm)

## Getting started

## Installing the package

Whilst in the root folder, in a terminal, you can install the package and its
Python dependencies using:

### Install for contributors/developers

To install the contributing requirements, use:
