                               Version 3, 29 June 2007
        
         Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
                                    Preamble
        
          The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
        software and other kinds of works.
        
          The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
        to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
        the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
        share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
        software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
        GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
        any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
        your programs, too.
        
          When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
        them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
        want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
        free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
        
          To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
        you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
        
          For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
        gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
        freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
        or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
        know their rights.
        
          Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
        
          For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
        that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
        authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
        changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
        authors of previous versions.
        
          Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
        modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
        can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
        protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
        pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
        use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
        have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
        products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
        stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
        of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
        
          Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
        avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
        make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
        patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
        
          The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.
        
                               TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
          0. Definitions.
        
          "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
        
          "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
        works, such as semiconductor masks.
        
          "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
        License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
        "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
        
          To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
        in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
        exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
        earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
        
          A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
        on the Program.
        
          To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
        permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
        infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
        computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
        distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
        public, and in some countries other activities as well.
        
          To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
        parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
        a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
        
          An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
        to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
        feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
        tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
        extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
        work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
        the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
        menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
        
          1. Source Code.
        
          The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
        for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
        form of a work.
        
          A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
        standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
        interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
        is widely used among developers working in that language.
        
          The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
        than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
        packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
        Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
        Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
        implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
        "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
        (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
        (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
        produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
        
          The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
        the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
        work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
        control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
        System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
        programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
        which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
        includes interface definition files associated with source files for
        the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
        linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
        such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
        subprograms and other parts of the work.
        
          The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
        can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
        Source.
        
          The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
        same work.
        
          2. Basic Permissions.
        
          All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
        copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
        conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
        permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
        covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
        content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
        rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
        
          You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
        convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
        in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
        of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
        with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
        the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
        not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
        for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
        and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
        your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
        
          Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
        the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
        makes it unnecessary.
        
          3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
        
          No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
        measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
        11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
        similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
        measures.
        
          When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
        circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
        is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
        the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
        modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
        users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
        technological measures.
        
          4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
        
          You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
        receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
        appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
        keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
        non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
        keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
        recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
        
          You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
        and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
        
          5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
        
          You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
        produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
        terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
        
            a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
            it, and giving a relevant date.
        
            b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
            released under this License and any conditions added under section
            7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
            "keep intact all notices".
        
            c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
            License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
            License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
            additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
            regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
            permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
            invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
        
            d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
            Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
            interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
            work need not make them do so.
        
          A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
        works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
        and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
        in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
        "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
        used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
        beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
        in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
        parts of the aggregate.
        
          6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
        
          You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
        of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
        machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
        in one of these ways:
        
            a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
            Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
            customarily used for software interchange.
        
            b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
            written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
            long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
            model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
            copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
            product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
            medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
            more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
            conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
            Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
        
            c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
            written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
            alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
            only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
            with subsection 6b.
        
            d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
            place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
            Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
            further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
            Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
            copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
            may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
            that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
            clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
            Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
            Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
            available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
        
            e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
            you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
            Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
            charge under subsection 6d.
        
          A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
        from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
        included in conveying the object code work.
        
          A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
        tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
        or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
        into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
        doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
        product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
        typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
        of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
        actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
        is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
        commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
        the only significant mode of use of the product.
        
          "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
        procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
        and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
        a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
        suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
        code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
        modification has been made.
        
          If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
        specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
        part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
        User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
        fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
        Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
        by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
        if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
        modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
        been installed in ROM).
        
          The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
        requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
        for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
        the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
        network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
        adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
        protocols for communication across the network.
        
          Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
        in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
        documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
        source code form), and must require no special password or key for
        unpacking, reading or copying.
        
          7. Additional Terms.
        
          "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
        License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
        Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
        be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
        that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
        apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
        under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
        this License without regard to the additional permissions.
        
          When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
        remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
        it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
        removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
        additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
        for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
        
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
        add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
        that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
        
            a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
            terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
        
            b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
            author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
            Notices displayed by works containing it; or
        
            c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
            requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
            reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
        
            d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
            authors of the material; or
        
            e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
            trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
        
            f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
            material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
            it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
            any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
            those licensors and authors.
        
          All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
        restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
        received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
        governed by this License along with a term that is a further
        restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
        a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
        License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
        of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
        not survive such relicensing or conveying.
        
          If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
        must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
        additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
        where to find the applicable terms.
        
          Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
        form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
        the above requirements apply either way.
        
          8. Termination.
        
          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
        provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
        modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
        this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
        paragraph of section 11).
        
          However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
        license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
        provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
        finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
        holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
        prior to 60 days after the cessation.
        
          Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
        reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
        violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
        received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
        copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
        your receipt of the notice.
        
          Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
        licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
        this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
        reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
        material under section 10.
        
          9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
        
          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
        run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
        occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
        to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
        nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
        modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
        not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
        covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
        
          10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
        
          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
        receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
        propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
        for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
        
          An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
        organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
        organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
        work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
        transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
        licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
        give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
        Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
        the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
        
          You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
        rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
        not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
        rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
        any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
        sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
        
          11. Patents.
        
          A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
        License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
        work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
        
          A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
        owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
        hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
        by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
        but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
        consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
        purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
        patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
        this License.
        
          Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
        patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
        make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
        propagate the contents of its contributor version.
        
          In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
        agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
        (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
        sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
        party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
        patent against the party.
        
          If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
        and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
        to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
        publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
        then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
        available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
        patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
        consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
        license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
        actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
        covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
        in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
        country that you have reason to believe are valid.
        
          If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
        arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
        covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
        receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
        or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
        you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
        work and works based on it.
        
          A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
        the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
        conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
        specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
        work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
        in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
        to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
        the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
        parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
        patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
        conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
        for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
        contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
        or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
        
          Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
        any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
        otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
        
          12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
        
          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
        excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
        covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
        License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
        not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
        to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
        the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
        License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
        
          13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
        
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
        permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
        under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
        combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
        License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
        but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
        section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
        combination as such.
        
          14. Revised Versions of this License.
        
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
        the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
        be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
        address new problems or concerns.
        
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
        Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
        Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
        option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
        version or of any later version published by the Free Software
        Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
        GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
        by the Free Software Foundation.
        
          If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
        versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
        public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
        to choose that version for the Program.
        
          Later license versions may give you additional or different
        permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
        author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
        later version.
        
          15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
        
          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
        APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
        OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
        THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
        IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
        ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        
          16. Limitation of Liability.
        
          IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
        THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
        GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
        USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
        DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
        PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
        EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
        SUCH DAMAGES.
        
          17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
        
          If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
        above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
        reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
        an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
        Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
        copy of the Program in return for a fee.
        
                             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
        
          If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
        possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
        free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
        
          To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
        
            <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
            Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
        
            This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
            it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
            the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
            (at your option) any later version.
        
            This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
            but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
            MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
            GNU General Public License for more details.
        
            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
            along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
        
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
        
          If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
        notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
        
            <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
            This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
            This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
            under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
        
        The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
        parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
        might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
        
          You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
        if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
        For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
        <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
        
          The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
        into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
        may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
        the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
        Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
        <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

## Detailed Description

This library functions as the central hub for collecting and preprocessing the data for all current and future projects
in the Sun lab. To do so, it exposes the API to interface with all data acquisition systems in the lab. Primarily, this
relies on specializing various general-purpose libraries released as part of the 'Ataraxis' science-automation project
to work within the specific hardware implementations available in the lab.

This library is explicitly designed to work with the specific hardware and data handling strategies used in the Sun lab
and broadly consists of two parts: the shared assets and the acquisition-system-specific bindings. 
The shared assets are reused by all acquisition systems and are mostly inherited 
from the [sl-shared-assets](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-shared-assets) library.
The acquisition-system-specific code is tightly integrated with the hardware used in the lab and is generally not
designed to be reused in any other context. See the [data acquisition systems](#data-acquisition-systems) section for
more details on currently supported acquisition systems.

The rest of this ReadMe assumes familiarity with the procedures, experiments, and tools used in the Sun lab
to acquire scientific data. See the lab [publications](https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/publications) before reading
further for an introduction to the work done in the lab.

## Installation

### Source

Note, installation from source is ***highly discouraged*** for anyone who is not an active project developer.

1. Download this repository to the local machine using the preferred method, such as git-cloning. Use one of the
   [stable releases](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-experiment/releases).
2. If the downloaded distribution is stored as a compressed archive, unpack it using the appropriate decompression tool.
3. ```cd``` to the root directory of the prepared project distribution.
4. Run ```python -m pip install .``` to install the project. Alternatively, if using a distribution with precompiled
   binaries, use ```python -m pip install WHEEL_PATH```, replacing 'WHEEL_PATH' with the path to the wheel file.

### pip

Use the following command to install the library using pip: ```pip install sl-experiment```.

## Data Acquisition Systems

A data acquisition (and runtime control) system can be broadly defined as a collection of hardware and software tools
used to conduct training or experiment sessions that acquire scientific data. Each data acquisition system can use one
or more machines (PCs) to acquire the data, with this library (sl-experiment) typically running on the **main** data
acquisition machine. Additionally, each system typically uses a Network Attached Storage (NAS), a remote storage server,
or both to safely store the data after the acquisition (with redundancy and parity).

In the Sun lab, each data acquisition system is built around the main tool used to acquire the brain activity data. For
example, the main system in the Sun lab is the [Mesoscope-VR](#mesoscope-vr-data-acquisition-system) system, which uses
the [2-Photon Random Access Mesoscope (2P-RAM)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/14472). All other components of that
system are built around the Mesoscope to facilitate the acquisition of the brain activity data. Due to this inherent
specialization, each data acquisition system in the lab is treated as an independent unit that requires custom software
to acquire, preprocess, and process the resultant data.

***Note!*** Since each data acquisition system is unique, the section below is iteratively expanded to include
system-specific assembly instructions for **each supported acquisition system**. Commonly, updates to this section
coincide with major or minor library version updates.

___

## Mesoscope-VR Data Acquisition System

This is the main data acquisition system currently used in the Sun lab. The system broadly consists of four major
parts:
1. The [2-Photon Random Access Mesoscope (2P-RAM)](https://elifesciences.org/articles/14472), assembled by
   [Thor Labs](https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=10646) and controlled by
   [ScanImage](https://www.mbfbioscience.com/products/scanimage/) software. The Mesoscope control and data acquisition
   are performed by a dedicated computer referred to as the **'ScanImagePC'**. This PC is assembled and configured by
   [MBF Bioscience](https://www.mbfbioscience.com/). The only modification carried out by the Sun lab during assembly 
   was the configuration of a Server Message Block (SMB) protocol access to the root directory used by the ScanImage 
   software to save the Mesoscope data.
2. The [Unity game engine](https://unity.com/products/unity-engine) running the Virtual Reality game world used in all
   experiments to control the task environment and resolve the task logic. The virtual environment runs on the main data
   acquisition computer referred to as the **'VRPC'** and relies on the [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) communication protocol
   and the [Sun lab's implementation of the GIMBL package](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/Unity-tasks) to 
   bidirectionally interface with the virtual task environment.
3. The [microcontroller-powered hardware](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-micro-controllers) that allows the animal
   to bidirectionally interface with various physical components (modules) of the Mesoscope-VR system.
4. A set of visual and IR-range cameras, used to acquire behavior video data.

### Main Dependency
- ***Linux*** operating system. While the library *may* also work on Windows and (less likely) macOS, it has been
  explicitly written for and tested on the mainline [6.18 kernel](https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_6.18) and
  Ubuntu 24.04 LTS distribution of the GNU Linux operating system using [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) 
  window system architecture.

### Software Dependencies
***Note!*** This list only includes *external dependencies*, which are installed *in addition* to all
dependencies automatically installed from pip / conda as part of library installation. The dependencies below have to
be installed and configured on the **VRPC** before calling runtime commands via the command line interface (CLI) exposed
by this library.

- [MQTT broker](https://mosquitto.org/) version **2.0.22**. The broker should be running locally and can use
  the **default** IP (127.0.0.1) and Port (1883) configuration.
- [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html). As a minimum, the version of FFMPEG should support H265 and H264
  codecs with hardware acceleration (Nvidia GPU). This library was tested with the version **8.0.1**.
- [MvImpactAcquire](https://assets-2.balluff.com/mvIMPACT_Acquire/). This library is tested with version **2.9.2**,
  which is freely distributed. Higher GenTL producer versions likely work too, but they require purchasing a
  license.
- [Zaber Launcher](https://software.zaber.com/zaber-launcher/download) version **2025.12.30-1**.
- [Unity Game Engine](https://unity.com/products/unity-engine) version **6000.3.3f1 LTS**.

### Hardware Dependencies

**Note!** These dependencies only apply to the **VRPC**. Hardware dependencies for the **ScanImagePC** are determined
and controlled by MBF and ThorLabs. This library benefits from the **ScanImagePC** being outfitted with a 10-GB network
card, but this is not a strict requirement.

- [Nvidia GPU](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/). This library uses GPU hardware acceleration to encode acquired video
  data. Any Nvidia GPU with hardware encoding chip(s) should work as expected. The library was tested with **RTX 4090**.
- A CPU with at least 12, preferably 16, physical cores. This library has been tested with
  [AMD Ryzen 7950X CPU](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/7000-series/amd-ryzen-9-7950x.html).
  It is recommended to use CPUs with 'full' cores, instead of those using a mixture of 'efficiency' and 'performance' 
  cores for predictable performance of all library components.
- A 10-Gigabit capable motherboard or Ethernet adapter, such as [X550-T2](https://shorturl.at/fLLe9). Primarily, this is
  required for the high-quality machine vision cameras used to record videos of the animal's face and body. The 
  10-Gigabit lines are also used for transferring the data between the PCs used in the data acquisition process and 
  the destination machines used for long-term data storage 
  (see [acquired data management section](#acquired-data-structure-and-management) for more details).

### System Assembly

The Mesoscope-VR system consists of multiple interdependent components. We are constantly making minor changes to the
system to optimize its performance and facilitate novel experiments and projects carried out in the lab. Treat this
section as a general system composition guide, but consult lab publications over this section for instructions on
building specific system implementations used to acquire the data featured in different publications.

Physical assembly and mounting of ***all*** hardware components mentioned in the specific subsections below is discussed
in the [main Mesoscope-VR assembly section](#mesoscope-vr-assembly).

### Zaber Motors
All brain activity recordings with the Mesoscope require the animal to be head-fixed. To orient head-fixed animals on
the Virtual Reality treadmill (running wheel) and promote task performance, the system uses three groups of motors
controlled through Zaber motor controllers. The first group, the **HeadBar**, is used to position the animal's head in
Z, Pitch, and Roll axes. Together with the movement axes of the Mesoscope, this allows for a wide range of
motions necessary to align the Mesoscope objective with the brain imaging plane. The second group of
motors, the **LickPort**, controls the position of the water delivery port (tube) (and sensor) in X, Y, and Z axes. This
is used to ensure all animals have comfortable access to the water delivery tube, regardless of their head position.
This motor group also controls the position of the aversive air puff valve, which is mounted directly above the
LickPort. The third group of motors, the **Wheel**, controls the position of the running wheel in the X-axis relative 
to the head-fixed animal's body and is used to position the animal on the running wheel to promote good running 
behavior.

The current snapshot of Zaber motor configurations used in the lab, alongside the motor parts list, and electrical 
wiring instructions is available 
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SL75KE3S2vuR9TTkxe6N4wvrYdK-Zmxn?usp=drive_link).

**Warning!** Zaber motors have to be configured correctly to work with this library. To (re)configure the motors to work
with the library, apply the setting snapshots from the link above via the
[Zaber Launcher](https://software.zaber.com/zaber-launcher/download) software. Read the instructions in
the 'Applying Zaber Configuration' document for the correct application procedure.

**Although highly discouraged, it is also possible to edit the motor settings manually**. To configure the motors
to work with this library, overwrite the non-volatile User Data of each motor device (controller) with
the data expected by this library:
1. **User Data 0**: Device CRC Code. This variable should store the CRC32-XFER checksum of the device's name
   (user-defined name). During runtime, the library generates the CRC32-XFER checksum of each device's name and compares
   it against the value stored inside the User Data 0 variable to ensure that each device is configured appropriately to
   work with the sl-experiment library. **Hint!** Use the `sl-get checksum` console command to generate the CRC32-XFER
   checksum for each device during manual configuration, as it uses the same code as used during runtime and, therefore,
   guarantees that the checksums match.
2. **User Data 1**: Device ShutDown Flag. This variable tracks whether the device was properly shut down during
   previous runtimes. The library sets this variable to 0 at runtime startup and back to 1 during proper shutdown.
   This flag is only checked for devices marked as "unsafe" (see User Data 10 below). For unsafe devices that were
   not properly shut down, the system prompts for user confirmation before re-homing the motor at the beginning of the 
   next runtime.
3. **User Data 10**: Device Unsafe Flag. This variable should be set to **1** for motors that can be positioned in a
   way that is not safe to home after power cycling (e.g., motors that could collide with other components during
   homing). When a motor marked as unsafe is not properly shut down (User Data 1 = 0), the system prompts the
   user for confirmation before proceeding with the homing sequence.
4. **User Data 11**: Device Park Position. This variable should be set to the position, in native motor units, where
   the device should be moved as part of the 'park' command and the shut-down sequence. This is used to position all
   motors in a way that guarantees they can be safely 'homed' at the beginning of the next runtime. Therefore, each
   park position has to be selected so that each motor can move to their 'home' sensor without colliding with any other
   motor **simultaneously** moving towards their 'home' position. **Note!** The LickPort uses the 'park' position as
   the **default** imaging position. During runtime, it moves to the 'park' position if it has no animal-specific
   position to use during imaging. Therefore, the park position for the LickPort should always be set so that
   it cannot harm the animal mounted in the Mesoscope enclosure while moving to the park position from any other
   position.
5. **User Data 12** Device Maintenance Position. This variable should be set to the position, in native motor units,
   where the device should be moved as part of the 'maintain' command. Primarily, this position is used during water
   delivery system calibration and the running-wheel surface maintenance. Typically, this position is calibrated to
   provide easy access to all hardware components of the system by moving all motors as far away from each other as
   reasonable.
6. **User Data 13**: Device Mount Position. This variable should be set to the position, in native motor units, where
   the device should be moved as part of the 'mount' command. For the LickPort, this position is usually far away from
   the animal, which facilitates mounting and unmounting the animal from the rig. For the HeadBar and the Wheel motor
   groups, this position is used as the **default** imaging position. Therefore, the HeadBar and the Wheel 'mount'
   positions should be set so that any (new) animal can be comfortably and safely mounted in the Mesoscope enclosure.

### Behavior Cameras
To record the animal's behavior, the system uses two high-end machine-vision cameras with 2-MegaPixel resolution. The
**face_camera** records the animal's face, while the **body_camera** records the body of the animal. To interface with 
the cameras, the system leverages customized
[ataraxis-video-system](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-video-system) bindings.

Specific information about the cameras and related imaging hardware, as well as the snapshot of the configuration
parameters used by each camera, is available
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l9dLT2s1ysdA3lLpYfLT1gQlTXotq79l?usp=sharing).

### MicroControllers
To interface with all other hardware components **other** than cameras and Zaber motors, the Mesoscope-VR system uses
Teensy 4.1 microcontrollers with specialized
[ataraxis-micro-controller](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controller) code. Currently, The system
uses three isolated microcontroller subsystems: **Actor**, **Sensor**, and **Encoder**.

For instructions on assembling and wiring the electronic components used in each microcontroller system, as well as the
code running on each microcontroller, see the
[microcontroller repository](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-micro-controllers).

### Virtual Reality Task Environment (Unity)
The task environment used in all Mesoscope-VR experiments is rendered and controlled by the Unity game engine. To make
Unity work with this library, each project-specific Unity task must use the bindings and assets released as part of the
[Unity-tasks repository](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/Unity-tasks). Follow the instructions from that repository to
set up Unity Game engine to interface with this library and to create new virtual task environments.

**Note!** This library does not contain tools to initialize Unity Game engine. The desired Virtual Reality task
has to be started ('armed') ***manually*** before entering the main runtime (data acquisition session) cycle. The main
Unity repository contains more details about starting the virtual reality tasks when running experiments. During
CLI-driven experiment runtimes, the library instructs the user when to 'arm' the Unity game engine.

#### Configuration Sharing via MQTT
The sl-experiment library and Unity communicate bidirectionally using the MQTT protocol. This communication is used to:
- **Verify scene configuration**: At startup, sl-experiment requests the active Unity scene name and validates it
  against the expected scene from the experiment configuration file.
- **Exchange cue sequences**: Unity sends the VR environment's wall cue sequence to sl-experiment, which decomposes
  it into individual trials using the trial structures defined in the experiment configuration.
- **Synchronize runtime state**: sl-experiment sends encoder data (animal motion) to Unity and receives stimulus
  triggers (reward delivery, gas puffs) and task guidance state updates.
- **Control task guidance**: sl-experiment can adjust task guidance modes based on animal performance.

Experiment configurations are stored as YAML files in the project's configuration directory and are shared between
Unity and sl-experiment. A copy of the experiment configuration is preserved with each session's raw data for
reproducibility.

### Google Sheets API Integration

This library interacts with the shared Google Sheet files used in the Sun lab to track and communicate certain
information about the animals that participate in all projects. Currently, this includes two files: the **surgery log**
and the **water restriction log**. Primarily, this integration is used to ensure that all information about each
experiment subject (animal) is stored in the same location (on the long-term storage machine(s)). Additionally, it is
used in the lab to automate certain data logging tasks.

#### Setting up Google Sheets API Access

**Skip to the next section if a service Google Sheets API account already exists.** Most lab members can safely
ignore this section, as all service accounts are managed at the acquisition-system level, rather than individual lab
members.

1. Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome).
2. Create a new project.
3. Navigate to APIs & Services → Library and enable the Google Sheets API for the project.
4. Under IAM & Admin → Service Accounts, create a service account. This generates a service account ID in the format
   of `service-account@gserviceaccount.com`.
5. Use Actions → Manage Keys and, if a key does not already exist, create a new key and download it in JSON format.
   This key is then used to access the Google Sheets.

#### Adding Google Sheets Access to the Service Account
To access the **surgery log** and the **water restriction log** Google Sheets as part of this library runtime, create
and share these log files with the email of the service account created above. The service account requires **Editor**
access to both files.

**Note!** This feature requires that both log files are formatted according to the available Sun lab templates.
Otherwise, the parsing algorithm does not behave as expected, leading to runtime failures. Additionally, both log files
have to be pre-filled in advance, as the processing code is not allowed to automatically generate new table (log) rows.
**Hint!** Currently, it is advised to pre-fill the data a month in advance. Since most experiments last for at most a
month, this usually covers the entire experiment period for any animal.

### ScanImage PC Assets
As mentioned above, the ScanImagePC is largely assembled and configured by external contractors. However, the PC
requires additional assets and configuration post-assembly to make it compatible with sl-experiment-managed runtimes.

#### File System Access
To support the sl-experiment runtime, the ScanImagePC's filesystem must be accessible to the **VRPC** via the Server
Message Block version 3 (SMB3) or equivalent protocol. Since ScanImagePC uses Windows, it is advised to use the SMB3
protocol, as all Windows machines support it natively with minimal configuration. As a minimum, the ScanImagePC must be
configured to share the root Mesoscope output directory with the VRPC over the local network. This is required to both
fetch the data acquired by the Mesoscope during preprocessing and to control the Mesoscope during runtime.

#### Default Screenshot Directory
During runtime, the sl-experiment library prompts the user to generate a screenshot of the ScanImagePC desktop and
place it in the network-shared mesoscope data directory (see above). The screenshot is used to store the information 
about the red-dot alignment, the acquisition parameters, and the state of the imaging plane at the beginning of each 
session. The library is statically configured to fetch the screenshot from the shared directory and does not look in 
any other directories. Therefore, it is advised to reconfigure the default output directory used by the 'Win + PrntSc' 
command on the ScanImagePC to save the screenshots into the shared Mesoscope output directory.

#### MATLAB Assets
ScanImage software is written in MATLAB and controls all aspects of Mesoscope data acquisition. While each runtime
requires the experimenter to manually interface with the ScanImage GUI during Mesoscope preparation, all data
acquisition runtimes using the sl-experiment library require the user to call the **setupAcquisition** MATLAB function
available from [mesoscope assets repository](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-mesoscope-assets). This function carries
out multiple runtime-critical tasks, including setting up the acquisition, generating and applying the online motion
correction algorithm, and allowing the VRPC to control the Mesoscope via creating or removing binary marker files.

To configure MATLAB to access the mesoscope assets, git-clone the entire repository to the ScanImagePC. Then, follow the
tutorials [here](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_env/add-remove-or-reorder-folders-on-the-search-path.html)
and add the path to the root mesoscope assets directory to MATLAB's search path. MATLAB can then use all
functions from that repository, including the setupAcquisition function. The repository also contains the online
motion estimation and correction assets developed in the [Pachitariu and Stringer lab](https://mouseland.github.io/),
which are required for the setupAcquisition function to work as expected.

### Mesoscope-VR Assembly
***This section is currently a placeholder. Since the final Mesoscope-VR system design is still a work in progress, it
will be populated once the final design implementation is constructed and tested in the lab.***

The Mesoscope-VR assembly mostly consists of two types of components. First, it includes custom components manufactured
via 3D-printing or machining (for metalwork). Second, it consists of generic components available from vendors such as
ThorLabs, which are altered in workshops to fit the specific requirements of the Mesoscope-VR system. The blueprints and
CAD files for all components of the Mesoscope-VR systems, including CAD renders of the assembled system, are available
[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oz2qWAg3HkMqw6VXKlY_c3clcz-rDBgi?usp=sharing).

## Acquired Data Structure and Management

The library defines a fixed structure for storing all acquired data which uses a 4-level directory tree hierarchy:
**root** (volume), **project**, **animal**, and **session**. This structure is reused by all acquisition systems, and
it is maintained across all long-term storage destinations. After each data acquisition runtime (session), all
raw data is stored under the **root/project/animal/session/raw_data** directory stored on one or more machines mentioned
below.

Currently, each data acquisition system in the lab uses at least three machines:
1. The **main data acquisition PC** is used to acquire and preprocess the data. For example, the *VRPC* of the
   *Mesoscope-VR* system is the main data acquisition PC for that system. This PC is used to both **acquire** the data
   and, critically, to **preprocess** the data before it is moved to the long-term storage destinations.
2. The **BioHPC compute server** is the main long-term storage destination. This is a high-performance computing
   server owned by the lab that stores all raw data acquired by Sun lab acquisition systems.
3. The **Synology NAS** is the back-up 'cold' long-term storage destination. It only stores the raw data and is
   located in a different physical location from the main BioHPC compute server to provide data storage redundancy. It
   is only used to back up raw data and is generally not intended to be accessed unless the main data storage becomes
   compromised for any reason.

***Critical!*** Each data acquisition system is designed to **mount the BioHPC and the NAS to the main acquisition PC
filesystem using the Server Message Block 3 (SMB3) protocol**. Therefore, each data acquisition system operates on the
assumption that all storage component filesystems are used contiguously and can be freely accessed by the main
acquisition PC's Operating System.

***Note!*** The library tries to maintain at least two copies of data for long-term storage: one on the NAS and the
other on the BioHPC server. It is configured to purge redundant data from the data acquisition system machines if
the data has been moved to the long-term storage destinations.

### Root Directory (Volume)
All data acquisition systems, the Synology NAS, and the BioHPC server keep **ALL** Sun lab projects in the same **root**
directory. The exact location and name of the root directory on each machine is arbitrary but should generally remain
fixed (unchanging) over the entire lifetime of that specific machine.

### Project Directory
When a new project is created, a **project** directory **named after the project** is created under the **root**
directory of the main data acquisition machine. Whe the data is moved to the Synology NAS and the BioHPC server 
as part of preprocessing, the project directory is also created on these destinations, if it does ot already exist.

All data acquisition systems also create a **configuration** subdirectory under the root project directory. This
directory stores all supported experiment configurations for the project. The `sl-run session` command searches the
configuration directory for the .yaml file with the name of the target experiment to load the experiment data.

### Animal Directory
When the library is used to acquire data for a new animal, it generates a new **animal** directory under the **root**
and **project** directory combination. The directory uses the ID of the animal as its name.

All data acquisition systems also create a **persistent_data** subdirectory under the root animal directory, which is
used to store data that is reused between data acquisition sessions.

***Critical!*** The current Sun lab convention stipulates that all animal IDs should be numeric. While some library
components do accept strings as inputs, it is expected that all animal IDs only consist of positive integers. Failure to
adhere to this naming convention can lead to runtime errors and unexpected behavior of all library components!

### Session Directory
Each time the library is used to acquire data, a new session directory is created under the **root**, **project** and
**animal** directory combination. The session name is derived from the current ***UTC*** timestamp at the time of the
session directory creation, accurate to ***microseconds***. Primarily, this naming format was chosen to make all
sessions acquired by the same acquisition system have unique and chronologically sortable names. The session name format
follows the order of **YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-US**.

### Raw Data
All data acquired by this library is stored under the **raw_data** subdirectory, generated for each session. Overall,
an example path to the acquired (raw) data can therefore look like this:
`/media/Data/Experiments/Template/666/2025-11-11-05-03-234123/raw_data/`.

***Note!*** This library treats **both** newly acquired and preprocessed data as **raw**. This is because preprocessing
**does not change the content of the data**. Instead, preprocessing uses lossless compression to more efficiently
package the data for transmission and can at any time be converted back to the original format.

### Shared Raw Data

The section below briefly lists the data acquired by **all** Sun lab data acquisition systems. Note, each acquisition
system also generates **system-specific** data, which is listed under acquisition-system-specific sections available
after this section.

**Note!** For information about the **processed** data, see the
[main data processing library](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-forgery).

After acquisition and preprocessing, the **raw_data** directory of each acquisition system contains, as a minimum, the
following files and subdirectories:
1. **ax_checksum.txt**: Stores the xxHash-128 checksum used to verify data integrity when it is transferred to the
   long-term storage destination. The checksum is generated before the data leaves the main data acquisition system PC
   and, therefore, accurately captures the final state of the raw data before it enters storage.
2. **hardware_state.yaml**: Stores the snapshot of the dynamically calculated parameters used by the data acquisition
   system modules during runtime. These parameters are recalculated at the beginning of each data acquisition
   session and are rounded and stored using the appropriate floating point type (usually fp64) to minimize floating
   point rounding errors. This file is also used to determine which modules were used during runtime and, consequently,
   which data can be parsed from the .npz log files generated at runtime (see below).
3. **session_data.yaml**: Stores information necessary to maintain the same session data structure across all machines
   used during data acquisition and long-term storage. This file is used by all Sun lab libraries as an entry point for
   working with session's data. The file also includes all available information about the identity and purpose of the
   session and can be used by human experimenters to identify the session. Since version 3.0.0, the file also stores
   the version of the sl-experiment and Python that were used to acquire the data.
4. **session_descriptor.yaml**: Stores session-type-specific information, such as the task parameters and experimenter
   notes. The contents of the file are different for each session type, although some fields are reused by all
   sessions. The contents for this file are partially written by the library (automatically) and, partially, by the
   experimenter (manually, at the end of each session). At the end of each runtime, a copy of the descriptor file is
   cached inside the *persistent_data* directory of the animal, replacing any already existing copy. This is used to
   optionally restore certain runtime configuration parameters between session types that support this functionality.
5. **surgery_metadata.yaml**: Stores the data on the surgical intervention(s) performed on the animal that participated
   in the session. This data is extracted from the **surgery log** Google Sheet and, for most animals, should be the
   same across all sessions.
6. **system_configuration.yaml**: Stores the configuration parameters of the data acquisition system that generated the
   session data. This is a snapshot of **all** dynamically addressable configuration parameters used by the system.
   When combined with the assembly instructions and the appropriate sl-experiment library version, it allows completely
   replicating the data acquisition system used to acquire the session's data.
7. **behavior_data**: Stores compressed .npz log files that contain all non-video behavior data acquired by the system.
   This includes all messages sent or received by each microcontroller, the timestamps for the frames acquired by
   each camera, and (if applicable) the main brain activity recording device (e.g.: Mesoscope). These logs also include
   session metadata, such as trials, task conditions, and system and runtime state transitions. Although the exact
   content of the behavior data directory can differ between acquisition systems, all systems used in the lab generate 
   some form of non-video behavior data.
8. **camera_data**: Stores the behavior videos recorded by video cameras used by the acquisition system. Videos are
   named using the session name and camera identifier (e.g., `{session_name}_face_camera.mp4`,
   `{session_name}_body_camera.mp4`).
9. **experiment_configuration.yaml**: This file is only created for **experiment** sessions. It stores the
   configuration of the experiment task performed by the animal during runtime. The contents of the file differ for each
   data acquisition system, but each system generates a version of this file. The file contains enough information to
   fully replicate the experiment runtime on the same acquisition system and to process and analyze the acquired data.
   Since version 4.0.0, the experiment configuration include the necessary data to fully replace the Virtual Reality 
   environment used during the experiments using Unity game engine and the assets available from the 
   [sl-unity-tasks](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-unity-tasks) library.

### Shared Temporary Data
The sl-experiment library additionally uses the following temporary marker files and directories which are cleared
before the raw data is transmitted to the long-term storage destinations:
1. **nk.bin**: This marker is automatically cached to disk as part of creating a new session data hierarchy. Each
   runtime removes this marker file when it successfully completes its runtime preparation. If this marker exists when 
   the runtime enters the shutdown cycle, this indicates that the runtime encountered a fatal error during startup and 
   had to be terminated early. In this case, the session's data is silently deleted, as uninitialized sessions 
   necessarily do not contain any valid data.
2. **behavior_data_log**: All behavior log entries are initially saved as individual .npy files. Each .npy file stores
   a serialized log message in the form of an uint8 (byte) NumPy array. Since messages are cached to disk as soon as
   they are received by the DataLogger to minimize data loss in case of emergency shutdowns, the temporary
   behavior_data_log directory is used to store these messages during runtime. Frequently, the directory accumulates
   millions of .npy files at runtime, making it challenging for human operators to work with the data. During
   preprocessing, individual .npy files are grouped by their source (what made the log entry, e.g.: VideoSystem,
   MicroController, Data Acquisition System, etc.) and are compressed into .npz archives, one for each source. The
   .npz archives are then moved to the *behavior_data* directory, and the *behavior_data_log* with the individual
   .npy files is deleted to conserve disk space.

### Mesoscope-VR System Data

The Mesoscope-VR system instantiates a directory hierarchy both on the VRPC and the ScanImagePC. Below is the list of
files and directories found on each of these machines.

#### Raw Data

The Mesoscope-VR system generates the following files and directories, in addition to those discussed in the shared
raw data section on the VRPC:
1. **mesoscope_data**: Stores all Mesoscope-acquired data. Since Mesoscope data is only acquired for **experiment**
   and **window checking** sessions, this directory is kept empty for training session types. During preprocessing,
   the directory contents are organized to automatically work with
   [sl-suite2p](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-suite2p) processing library. The directory contains:
   - **mesoscope_XXXXXX_XXXXXX.tiff**: Recompressed Mesoscope frame stacks using LERC lossless compression.
   - **frame_invariant_metadata.json**: ScanImage metadata constant across all frames (frame rate, plane/channel
     count, and ROI information).
   - **frame_variant_metadata.npz**: Per-frame metadata (frame numbers, timestamps, acquisition triggers).
   - **suite2p_parameters.json**: sl-suite2p-compatible configuration used for further data processing.
   - **MotionEstimator.me**: Reference motion estimator file.
   - **fov.roi**: Region-of-interest file defining the imaging field.
   - **zstack.tiff**: A high-resolution z-stack reference image for future alignment with histology data.
2. **zaber_positions.yaml**: Stores the snapshot of the positions used by the HeadBar, LickPort, and Wheel Zaber motor
   groups, taken at the end of the session's data acquisition. All positions are stored in native motor units. This
   file is created for all session types supported by the Mesoscope-VR system. As a backup, a copy of this file is also
   generated at the beginning of each session's runtime. This allows recovering from critical runtime failures, where 
   the runtime may not be able to generate this snapshot. During both snapshot generation timepoints, a copy of the
   generated snapshot file is also cached inside the *persistent_data* directory of the animal to support restoring the
   motors to the same position during the next session.
3. **mesoscope_positions.yaml**: Stores the snapshot of the Mesoscope objective position in the physical axes (X, Y, Z, 
   and Roll), the virtual ScanImage axes (Fast Z, Tip, and Tilt), and the laser power at the sample, taken at the end of
   the session's data acquisition. **Note!** This file relies on the experimenter updating the stored positions. It is 
   only created for window checking and experiment sessions. A copy of this snapshot file is also saved to the 
   *persistent_data* directory of the animal to support restoring the Mesoscope to the same imaging field during the 
   next session.
4. **window_screenshot.png**: Stores the screenshot of the ScanImagePC screen. The screenshot should contain the image
   of the red-dot alignment, the view of the target cell layer, the Mesoscope position information, and the data
   acquisition parameters. Primarily, the screenshot is used by experimenters to quickly reference the imaging quality
   from each experiment session. This file is only created for window checking and experiment sessions. A copy of this
   file is saved to the *persistent_data* directory of the animal to help the user to realign the red-dot to a similar
   position during the next session.

### ScanImagePC

All Mesoscope-VR system data on the ScanImagePC is stored under the user-defined ScanImagePC root directory, which is
expected to be mounted to the VRPC via the SMB or similar protocol. Under that root directory, the system creates the
following directories and files:
1. **mesoscope_data**: This directory stores all Mesoscope-acquired data for the currently running session. The
   *setupAcquisition* MATLAB function configures ScanImage software to output all data to the mesoscope_data directory,
   which is shared by all sessions, animals, and projects. This allows using the same static output path for all
   ScanImage acquisitions.
2. **session-specific mesoscope_data**: At the end of each runtime, the Mesoscope-VR system ***renames*** the
   mesoscope_data directory to instead use the session name (id). Then, it generates an empty mesoscope_data directory 
   for the next runtime. This way, all data of each completed session is stored under a unique directory named after 
   that session. This step is crucial for data preprocessing, which identifies the session data directory and pulls it 
   over to the VRPC based on the session name (id).
3. **persistent_data**. This directory is created for each unique **project** and **animal** combination,
   similar to the data structure created by sl-experiment on the main acquisition system PC. This directory contains
   the **first experiment day's** MotionEstimator.me and fov.roi files. These files are typically reused by all 
   following data acquisition sessions to restore the imaging field to the same location as used on the first day. The 
   full path to the persistent_data directory would typically look like **root/project/animal/persistent_data**.

#### Mesoscope-VR Temporary Data

The Mesoscope-VR system also generates the following temporary files and directories during runtime:
1. **raw_mesoscope_frames**: Stores uncompressed .TIFF stacks fetched by the VRPC from the ScanImagePC. This is done
   as part of data preprocessing to collect all data on the VRPC before executing individual preprocessing subroutines.
   The .TIFF stacks are then re-compressed using the Limited Error Raster Compression (LERC) scheme and are saved to the
   *mesoscope_data* directory. Once this process completes successfully, the *raw_mesoscope_frames* directory with all
   raw files is deleted to conserve disk space.
2. **kinase.bin**: This marker is created in the *mesoscope_data* ScanImagePC directory. During runtime, the
   *setupAcquisition* MATLAB function monitors the *mesoscope_data* directory for the presence of this marker file. If
   the file is present, the function triggers the Mesoscope data acquisition. If the file is absent, the function stops
   the Mesoscope data acquisition until the file is re-created. As such, the VRPC uses this marker file to start
   and stop the Mesoscope data acquisition during normal operation.
3. **phosphatase.bin**: This marker works similar to the *kinase.bin* marker, but is used by the VRPC to abort the
   ScanImagePC runtime at any point. When ScanImagePC is waiting for the *kinase.bin* marker to be created for the first
   time, stopping the Mesoscope acquisition necessarily requires the kinase marker to be first created and then removed,
   triggering a brief Mesoscope frame acquisition. Creating the *phosphatase.bin* marker instead triggers the
   ScanImagePC to end the runtime without waiting for the *kinase.bin* marker, effectively aborting the runtime without
   acquiring any frames.

## Acquiring Data in the Sun Lab

All user-facing library functionality is realized through a set of Command Line Interface (CLI) commands automatically
exposed when the library is pip-installed into a python environment. The library exposes three main CLI command groups:
`sl-get`, `sl-manage`, and `sl-run`. Each group contains subcommands that allow further configuring their runtime.
Use `--help` argument when calling any of the commands described below to see the list of supported arguments together
with their descriptions and default values.

To use any of the commands described below, activate the python environment where the library is installed, e.g., with
`conda activate MYENV` and type one of the commands described below.

***Warning!*** Most commands described below use the terminal to communicate important runtime information to the user
or request user feedback. **Carefully read every message printed to the terminal during runtime**.
Failure to do so may damage the equipment or harm the animal!

### CLI Command Overview

The sl-experiment library exposes three main CLI command groups:

| Command Group | Purpose                                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `sl-get`      | Discover and evaluate data acquisition system components |
| `sl-manage`   | Manage session data (preprocessing, deletion, migration) |
| `sl-run`      | Execute data acquisition and maintenance sessions        |

### Step 0: Configuring the Data Acquisition System

Before acquiring data, each acquisition system has to be configured. This step is done in addition to assembling
the system and installing the required hardware components. Typically, this only needs to be done when the acquisition
system configuration or hardware changes, so most lab members can safely skip this step.

Use `sl-configure system` command (from the
[sl-shared-assets](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-shared-assets) library) to generate the system configuration file.
As part of its runtime, the command configures the host machine to remember the path to the generated configuration
file, so all future sl-experiment runtimes on that machine automatically load and use the appropriate
acquisition-system configuration parameters.

***Note!*** Each acquisition system uses unique configuration parameters. Additionally, the sl-experiment library always
assumes that any machine (PC) can only be used by a single data-acquisition system (is permanently a part of that
acquisition system). Only the **main** PC of the data acquisition system (e.g.: the VRPC of the Mesoscope-VR system)
that runs the sl-experiment library should be configured via this command.

For information about the available system configuration parameters, read the *API documentation* of the appropriate
data-acquisition system available from the [sl-shared-assets](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-shared-assets) library.
Specifically, all data acquisition system configuration parameters are defined in the *SystemConfiguration* class named
after that system.

### Step 1: Creating a Project

All data acquisition sessions require a valid project to run. To create a new project, use the `sl-configure project`
command (from the [sl-shared-assets](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-shared-assets) library). This command can only
be called on the main PC of a properly configured data-acquisition system (see Step 0 above). As part of its runtime,
this command generates the root project directory on all machines that make up the data acquisition system.

### Step 2: Creating an Experiment

All projects that involve scientific experiments also need to define at least one **experiment configuration**.
Experiment configurations are unique for each data acquisition system and are stored inside .yaml files named after the
experiment. To generate a new experiment configuration file, use the `sl-configure experiment` command (from the
[sl-shared-assets](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-shared-assets) library). This command generates a **precursor**
experiment configuration file inside the **configuration** subdirectory, stored under the root project directory on the
main PC of the data acquisition system.

For information about the available experiment configuration parameters in the precursor file, read the
*API documentation* of the appropriate data-acquisition system available from the
[sl-shared-assets](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-shared-assets) library.

**Mesoscope-VR Note:** Mesoscope-VR experiments also require a valid Virtual Reality environment generated through the
[sl-unity-tasks](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-unity-tasks) package. The same experiment configuration file is used
by both sl-experiment and Unity to define the VR environment (cues, segments, and trials). After creating the
experiment configuration, use the Unity package to generate the corresponding VR scene before running experiment
sessions.

### Step 3: Discovering System Components

Before running sessions, use `sl-get` subcommands to discover and verify the components accessible to the data
acquisition system:

| Command                         | Description                                                                   |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sl-get zaber`                  | Discovers Zaber motor devices connected to the system                         |
| `sl-get projects`               | Lists projects configured for the data acquisition system                     |
| `sl-get experiments -p PROJECT` | Lists experiment configurations for the specified project                     |
| `sl-get cameras`                | Discovers cameras accessible to the system (OpenCV and Harvesters interfaces) |
| `sl-get controllers`            | Discovers microcontrollers accessible to the system                           |
| `sl-get ports`                  | Lists available serial communication ports                                    |
| `sl-get checksum -i STRING`     | Calculates the CRC32-XFER checksum for the input string                       |

### Step 4: Maintaining the Acquisition System

All acquisition systems contain modules that require frequent maintenance. Most of these modules are unique to each
acquisition system. Therefore, this section is further broken into acquisition-system-specific subsections.

#### Mesoscope-VR

The Mesoscope-VR system contains two modules that require frequent maintenance: the **water delivery system** and the
**running wheel**. To facilitate the maintenance of these modules, the sl-experiment library exposes the
`sl-run maintenance` command.

This command is typically called at least twice during each day the system is used to acquire data. First, it is used
at the beginning of the day to prepare the Mesoscope-VR system for runtime by filling the water delivery system. Second,
it is used at the end of each day to empty the water delivery system.

Less frequently, this command is used to re-calibrate the water delivery system, typically, as a result of replacing
system components, such as tubing or the valve itself. The command is also occasionally used to replace the
surface material of the running wheel, which slowly deteriorates as the wheel is used.

This command can also facilitate cleaning the wheel, which is typically done before and after each runtime to remove
any biological contaminants left by each animal participating in experiment or training runtimes.

***Note!*** This runtime uses a GUI-based interface for issuing commands and monitoring the system state.

### Step 5: Acquiring Data

Each acquisition system supports one or more distinct types of data-acquisition sessions (runtimes). As a minimum, this
includes an 'experiment' session type, which is the primary use case for all acquisition systems in the lab. Some
systems may also support one or more training session types, which often do not acquire any brain activity data, but
otherwise behave similar to experiment sessions.

All session commands require common parameters: user ID, project name, animal ID, and animal weight. These are provided
to the parent `sl-run session` command before specifying the session type.

#### Mesoscope-VR Session Commands

The Mesoscope-VR system supports four types of runtime sessions:

**1. Window Checking Session**
```bash
sl-run session -u USER -p PROJECT -a ANIMAL -w WEIGHT check-window
```

This session guides the user through finding the imaging plane and generating the reference MotionEstimator.me and
zstack.tiff files for the checked animal. This session is typically used ~2–3 weeks after the surgical intervention and
before any training or experiment sessions to assess the quality of the intervention and the suitability of including
the animal in experiment cohorts.

**2. Lick Training Session**
```bash
sl-run session -u USER -p PROJECT -a ANIMAL -w WEIGHT lick-training [OPTIONS]
```

All animals that participate in Mesoscope-VR experiments undergo a two-stage training protocol, with lick training
being the first stage. During this runtime, the animals are head fixed in the Mesoscope enclosure for ~20 minutes. The
primary goal of the runtime is to teach the animals to lick at the water tube to consume water rewards and associate
the sound tone emitted at reward delivery with water coming out of the tube. During runtime, the running wheel is
locked, so the animals cannot run.

Optional arguments include maximum training time, reward delay parameters, maximum water volume, and unconsumed reward
tracking threshold.

**3. Run Training Session**
```bash
sl-run session -u USER -p PROJECT -a ANIMAL -w WEIGHT run-training [OPTIONS]
```

This is the second stage of the mandatory two-stage Mesoscope-VR training protocol. During this runtime, the animals
are head fixed in the Mesoscope enclosure for ~40 minutes. The primary goal of the runtime is to teach the animals to
run on the wheel while head-fixed and to associate running with receiving water rewards. During runtime, the running
wheel is unlocked, but the Virtual Reality screens are kept off, ensuring that the animal is not exposed to any visual
cues until the first experiment day.

Optional arguments include maximum training time, speed and duration thresholds, threshold increase parameters, maximum
water volume, idle time allowance, and unconsumed reward tracking threshold.

**4. Experiment Session**
```bash
sl-run session -u USER -p PROJECT -a ANIMAL -w WEIGHT experiment -e EXPERIMENT [OPTIONS]
```

This session type is designed to execute the experiment specified in the target *experiment_configuration.yaml* file
(see above). The system supports varying experiment configurations and Virtual Reality environments, offering
experimenters the flexibility to run different projects using the same set of APIs and system hardware.

The `-e/--experiment` argument specifies the name of the experiment configuration to use.

### Step 6: Preprocessing and Managing Data

All acquisition systems support several ways of handling the session's data acquired at runtime. For most runtimes, the
choice of how to handle the data is made as part of the acquisition system shutdown sequence. However, in the case of
unexpected runtime terminations, all data preprocessing steps can also be executed manually by calling the appropriate
CLI command.

#### Preprocessing Data

The most commonly used operation is to **preprocess** the acquired data. This can be done manually by calling:

```bash
sl-manage preprocess -sp SESSION_PATH
```

Preprocessing consists of two major steps. The first step pulls all available data to the main data acquisition system
machine (PC) and re-packages (re-compresses) the data to reduce its size without loss. The second step distributes
(pushes) the data to **multiple** long-term storage destinations, such as the NAS and the BioHPC server.

**Critical!** It is imperative that **all** valid data acquired in the lab undergoes preprocessing
**as soon as possible**. Only preprocessed data is stored in a way that maximizes its safety by using both
redundancy and parity. Data that is not preprocessed may be **lost** in the case of emergency, which is considerably
less likely for the preprocessed data.

When preprocessed data is successfully and safely pushed to long-term storage destinations, the preprocessing runtime
removes the local copy of the session's data from the data acquisition system machine to conserve disk space.

#### Deleting Session Data

The second way of managing the data is primarily used during testing and when handling interrupted sessions that did
not generate any valid data. This involves removing all session data from **both** the data acquisition system and all
long-term storage destinations. This runtime is extremely dangerous and, if not used carefully, can
***permanently delete valid data***. This mode can be triggered using:

```bash
sl-manage delete -sp SESSION_PATH
```

**Warning!** This command is not recommended for most users.

#### Migrating Animal Data Between Projects

To transfer all sessions for an animal from one project to another, use:

```bash
sl-manage migrate -s SOURCE_PROJECT -d DESTINATION_PROJECT -a ANIMAL_ID
```

This moves the animal's data across all accessible storage destinations.

### MCP Servers

This library provides two MCP servers that expose CLI functionality for AI agent integration.

```bash
sl-get mcp      # Discovery and evaluation tools
sl-manage mcp   # Data management tools

## Recovering from Interruptions
While it is not typical for the data acquisition or preprocessing pipelines to fail during runtime, it is possible. The
library can recover or gracefully terminate the runtime for most code-generated errors, so this is usually not a
concern. However, if a major interruption (i.e., power outage) occurs or one of the hardware assets malfunctions during
runtime, manual intervention is typically required to recover the session's data and reset the acquisition system.

### Data acquisition interruption

Data acquisition can be interrupted in two main ways, the first being due to an external asset failure, for example, if
the ScanImagePC unexpectedly shuts down during Mesoscope-VR system runtime. In this case, the runtime pauses and
instructs the user to troubleshoot the issue and then resume the runtime. This type of *soft* interruption is handled
gracefully during runtime to exclude the data collected during the interruption from the output dataset. Generally,
soft interruptions are supported for most external assets, which includes anything not managed directly by the
sl-experiment library and the main data acquisition system PC. While inconvenient, these
interruptions do not typically require specialized handling other than recovering and restoring the failed asset.

**Note!** While most soft interruptions typically entail resuming the interrupted runtime, it is also possible to
instead terminate the runtime. To do so, execute the `terminate` command via the GUI instead of trying to resume
the runtime. In this case, the system attempts to execute a graceful shutdown procedure, saving all valid data in the
process.

The second way involves interruption due to sl-experiment runtime failures or unexpected shut-downs of the main
acquisition system PC. In these cases, manual user intervention is typically required to recover the useful data and
reset the system before the acquisition can be restarted. The handling of such cases often consists of specific steps
for each supported acquisition system. Typically, these *hard* interruptions are related to major issues, such as
global facility power loss or severe malfunction of sensitive acquisition system components, such as microcontrollers
and communication cables.

#### Mesoscope-VR
If the VRPC runtime unexpectedly interrupts at any point without executing the graceful shutdown, follow these
instructions:
1. If the session involved Mesoscope imaging, shut down the Mesoscope acquisition process and make sure all required
   files (frame stacks, motion estimator data, and cranial window screenshot) have been generated and saved to the
   **mesoscope_data** directory.
2. If necessary, **manually** edit the session_descriptor.yaml, the mesoscope_positions.yaml, and the
   zaber_positions.yaml files to include actual runtime information. Estimate the volume of water delivered at runtime
   by manually reading the water tank level gauge.
3. Remove the animal from the Mesoscope enclosure. If necessary, use the *Zaber Launcher* app to directly interface with
   Zaber motors and move them in a way that allows the animal to be recovered from the enclosure.
4. Use Zaber Launcher to **manually move the HeadBar group's Roll axis to have a positive angle** (> 0 degrees). This is
   critical! If this is not done, the motor cannot home during the next session and instead collides
   with the movement guard, at best damaging the motor and, at worst, the Mesoscope.
5. If the session involved Mesoscope imaging, **rename the mesoscope_data directory to use the session name**.
   For example, from mesoscope_data → 2025-11-11-05-03-234123. **Critical!** if this is not done, the library may
   **delete** any leftover Mesoscope files during the next runtime and cannot properly preprocess the frames for the
   interrupted session during the next step.
6. Call `sl-manage preprocess -sp SESSION_PATH` and provide the path to the session directory of the interrupted
   session. This preprocesses and transfers all collected data to the long-term storage destinations. This preserves
   any data acquired before the interruption and prepares the system for running the next session.

### Data preprocessing interruption
To recover from an error encountered during preprocessing, call `sl-manage preprocess -sp SESSION_PATH` and provide
the path to the session directory of the interrupted session. The preprocessing pipeline automatically resumes an
interrupted runtime from the nearest checkpoint.
