Welcome to sl-experiment API documentation page
===============================================

sl-experiment is a Python library that provides the assets for acquiring and preprocessing scientific data in the
Sun (NeuroAI) lab.

This library uses the tools released as part of the 'Ataraxis' science-automation project, developed in the
`Sun lab <https://neuroai.github.io/sunlab/>`_ at Cornell University. The main purpose of this library is to specialize
the context-agnostic Ataraxis tools to work for the specific runtime context(s) in the Sun lab.

This website only contains the API documentation for the assets offered by this library. See the project
GitHub repository for the installation instructions and additional library usage details:
