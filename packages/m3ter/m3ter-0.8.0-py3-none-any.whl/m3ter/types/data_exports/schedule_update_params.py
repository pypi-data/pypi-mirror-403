    Define a time period to control the range of usage data you want the data export
    to contain when it runs:

    - **TODAY**. Data collected for the current day up until the time the export is
      scheduled to run.
    - **YESTERDAY**. Data collected for the day before the export runs under the
      schedule - that is, the 24 hour period from midnight to midnight of the day
      before.
    - **PREVIOUS_WEEK**, **PREVIOUS_MONTH**, **PREVIOUS_QUARTER**,
      **PREVIOUS_YEAR**. Data collected for the previous full week, month, quarter,
      or year period. For example if **PREVIOUS_WEEK**, weeks run Monday to Monday -
      if the export is scheduled to run on June 12th 2024, which is a Wednesday, the
      export will contain data for the period running from Monday, June 3rd 2024 to
      midnight on Sunday, June 9th 2024.
    - **WEEK_TO_DATE**, **MONTH_TO_DATE**, or **YEAR_TO_DATE**. Data collected for
      the period covering the current week, month, or year period. For example if
      **WEEK_TO_DATE**, weeks run Monday to Monday - if the Export is scheduled to
      run at 10 a.m. UTC on October 16th 2024, which is a Wednesday, it will contain
      all usage data collected starting Monday October 14th 2024 through to the
      Wednesday at 10 a.m. UTC of the current week.
    - **LAST_12_HOURS**. Data collected for the twelve hour period up to the start
      of the hour in which the export is scheduled to run.
    - **LAST_7_DAYS**, **LAST_30_DAYS**, **LAST_35_DAYS**, **LAST_90_DAYS**,
      **LAST_120_DAYS** **LAST_YEAR**. Data collected for the selected period prior
      to the date the export is scheduled to run. For example if **LAST_30_DAYS**
      and the export is scheduled to run for any time on June 15th 2024, it will
      contain usage data collected for the previous 30 days - starting May 16th 2024
      through to midnight on June 14th 2024
