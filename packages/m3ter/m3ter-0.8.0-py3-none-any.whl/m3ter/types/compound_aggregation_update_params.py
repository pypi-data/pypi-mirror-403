    This formula determines how the CompoundAggregation value is calculated. The

    required when creating or updating a CompoundAggregation.

    **NOTE:** If a simple Aggregation referenced by a Compound Aggregation has a
    **Quantity per unit** defined or a **Rounding** defined, these will not be
    factored into the value used by the calculation. For example, if the simple
    Aggregation referenced has a base value of 100 and has **Quantity per unit** set
    at 10, the Compound Aggregation calculation _will use the base value of 100 not
    10_.

    Specifies how you want to deal with non-integer, fractional number Aggregation

    **NOTES:**

    - **NEAREST** rounds to the nearest half: 5.1 is rounded to 5, and 3.5 is
      rounded to 4.
    - Also used in combination with `quantityPerUnit`. Rounds the number of units
      after `quantityPerUnit` is applied. If you set `quantityPerUnit` to a value
      other than one, you would typically set Rounding to **UP**. For example,
      suppose you charge by kilobytes per second (KiBy/s), set `quantityPerUnit` =
      500, and set charge rate at $0.25 per unit used. If your customer used 48,900
      KiBy/s in a billing period, the charge would be 48,900 / 500 = 97.8 rounded up
