    Specifies the computation method applied to usage data collected in

    the selected `targetField`.

    Enum:

    - **SUM**. Adds the values. Can be applied to a **Measure**, **Income**, or
      **Cost** `targetField`.

    - **MIN**. Uses the minimum value. Can be applied to a **Measure**, **Income**,
      or **Cost** `targetField`.

    - **MAX**. Uses the maximum value. Can be applied to a **Measure**, **Income**,
      or **Cost** `targetField`.

    - **COUNT**. Counts the number of values. Can be applied to a **Measure**,
      **Income**, or **Cost** `targetField`.

    - **LATEST**. Uses the most recent value. Can be applied to a **Measure**,
      **Income**, or **Cost** `targetField`. Note: Based on the timestamp (`ts`)
      value of usage data measurement submissions. If using this method, please
      ensure _distinct_ `ts` values are used for usage data measurment submissions.

    - **MEAN**. Uses the arithmetic mean of the values. Can be applied to a
      **Measure**, **Income**, or **Cost** `targetField`.

    - **UNIQUE**. Uses unique values and returns a count of the number of unique
      values. Can be applied to a **Metadata** `targetField`.

    - **CUSTOM_SQL**. Uses an SQL query expression. If you select this Aggregation
      type, use the `customSQL` request parameter to enter an SQL query.

    - **NEAREST** rounds to the nearest half: 5.1 is rounded to 5, and 3.5 is
      rounded to 4.
    - Also used in combination with `quantityPerUnit`. Rounds the number of units
      after `quantityPerUnit` is applied. If you set `quantityPerUnit` to a value
      other than one, you would typically set Rounding to **UP**. For example,
      suppose you charge by kilobytes per second (KiBy/s), set `quantityPerUnit` =
      500, and set charge rate at $0.25 per unit used. If your customer used 48,900
