        """Creates a new Contract for the specified Account.

        The Contract includes
        information such as the associated Account along with start and end dates.

        If you intend to bill an Account on a Contract basis, you can use the
        `billGroupingKeyId`, `applyContractPeriodLimits`, and `usageFilters` request
        parameters to control Contract billing.

        Args:
          account_id: The unique identifier (UUID) of the Account associated with this Contract.

          end_date: The exclusive end date of the Contract _(in ISO-8601 format)_. This means the
              Contract is active until midnight on the day **_before_** this date.

          name: The name of the Contract.

          start_date: The start date for the Contract _(in ISO-8601 format)_. This date is inclusive,
              meaning the Contract is active from this date onward.

          apply_contract_period_limits: For Contract billing, a boolean setting for restricting the charges billed to
              the period defined for the Contract:

              - **TRUE** - Contract billing for the Account will be restricted to charge
                amounts that fall within the defined Contract period.
              - **FALSE** - The period for amounts billed under the Contract will be
                determined by the Account Plan attached to the Account and linked to the
                Contract.(_Default_)

          bill_grouping_key_id: The ID of the Bill Grouping Key assigned to the Contract.

              If you are implementing Contract Billing for an Account, use `billGroupingKey`
              to control how charges linked to Contracts on the Account will be billed:

              - **Independent Contract billing**. Assign an _exclusive_ Bill Grouping Key to
                the Contract - only charges due against the Account and linked to the single
                Contract will appear on a separate Bill.
              - **Collective Contract billing**. Assign the same _non-exclusive_ Bill Grouping
                Key to multiple Contracts - all charges due against the Account and linked to
                the multiple Contracts will appear together on a single Bill.

          code: The short code of the Contract.

          custom_fields: User defined fields enabling you to attach custom data. The value for a custom
              field can be either a string or a number.

              If `customFields` can also be defined for this entity at the Organizational
              level, `customField` values defined at individual level override values of
              `customFields` with the same name defined at Organization level.

              See
              [Working with Custom Fields](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/creating-and-managing-products/working-with-custom-fields)
              in the m3ter documentation for more information.

          description: The description of the Contract, which provides context and information.

          purchase_order_number: The Purchase Order Number associated with the Contract.

          usage_filters: Use `usageFilters` to control Contract billing and charge at billing only for
              usage where Product Meter dimensions equal specific defined values:

              - Define Usage filters to either _include_ or _exclude_ charges for usage
                associated with specific Meter dimensions.
              - The Meter dimensions must be present in the data field schema of the Meter
                used to submit usage data measurements.

          version:
              The version number of the entity:

              - **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - _do not use
                for Create_. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the
                response.
              - **Update Entity:** On Update, version is required and must match the existing
                version because a check is performed to ensure sequential versioning is
                preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request

        parameters to control Contract billing.

        Args:
          account_id: The unique identifier (UUID) of the Account associated with this Contract.

          end_date: The exclusive end date of the Contract _(in ISO-8601 format)_. This means the
              Contract is active until midnight on the day **_before_** this date.

          name: The name of the Contract.

          start_date: The start date for the Contract _(in ISO-8601 format)_. This date is inclusive,
              meaning the Contract is active from this date onward.

          apply_contract_period_limits: For Contract billing, a boolean setting for restricting the charges billed to
              the period defined for the Contract:

              - **TRUE** - Contract billing for the Account will be restricted to charge
                amounts that fall within the defined Contract period.

                determined by the Account Plan attached to the Account and linked to the
                Contract.(_Default_)

          bill_grouping_key_id: The ID of the Bill Grouping Key assigned to the Contract.

              If you are implementing Contract Billing for an Account, use `billGroupingKey`
              to control how charges linked to Contracts on the Account will be billed:

              - **Independent Contract billing**. Assign an _exclusive_ Bill Grouping Key to
                the Contract - only charges due against the Account and linked to the single
                Contract will appear on a separate Bill.
              - **Collective Contract billing**. Assign the same _non-exclusive_ Bill Grouping
                Key to multiple Contracts - all charges due against the Account and linked to
                the multiple Contracts will appear together on a single Bill.

          code: The short code of the Contract.

          custom_fields: User defined fields enabling you to attach custom data. The value for a custom
              field can be either a string or a number.

              If `customFields` can also be defined for this entity at the Organizational
              level, `customField` values defined at individual level override values of
              `customFields` with the same name defined at Organization level.

              in the m3ter documentation for more information.

          description: The description of the Contract, which provides context and information.

          purchase_order_number: The Purchase Order Number associated with the Contract.

          usage_filters: Use `usageFilters` to control Contract billing and charge at billing only for
              usage where Product Meter dimensions equal specific defined values:

              - Define Usage filters to either _include_ or _exclude_ charges for usage
                associated with specific Meter dimensions.
              - The Meter dimensions must be present in the data field schema of the Meter
                used to submit usage data measurements.

          version:
              The version number of the entity:

              - **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - _do not use
                for Create_. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the
