        Create a new CompoundAggregation.

        This endpoint allows you to create a new CompoundAggregation for a specific
        Organization. The request body must include all the necessary details such as
        the Calculation formula.

        Args:
          calculation: String that represents the formula for the calculation. This formula determines
              how the CompoundAggregation value is calculated. The calculation can reference
              simple Aggregations or Custom Fields. This field is required when creating or
              updating a CompoundAggregation.

              **NOTE:** If a simple Aggregation referenced by a Compound Aggregation has a
              **Quantity per unit** defined or a **Rounding** defined, these will not be
              factored into the value used by the calculation. For example, if the simple
              Aggregation referenced has a base value of 100 and has **Quantity per unit** set
              at 10, the Compound Aggregation calculation _will use the base value of 100 not
              10_.

          name: Descriptive name for the Aggregation.

          quantity_per_unit: Defines how much of a quantity equates to 1 unit. Used when setting the price
              per unit for billing purposes - if charging for kilobytes per second (KiBy/s) at
              rate of $0.25 per 500 KiBy/s, then set quantityPerUnit to 500 and price Plan at
              $0.25 per unit.

              **Note:** If `quantityPerUnit` is set to a value other than one, `rounding` is
              typically set to `"UP"`.

          rounding: Specifies how you want to deal with non-integer, fractional number Aggregation
              values.

              **NOTES:**

              - **NEAREST** rounds to the nearest half: 5.1 is rounded to 5, and 3.5 is
                rounded to 4.
              - Also used in combination with `quantityPerUnit`. Rounds the number of units
                after `quantityPerUnit` is applied. If you set `quantityPerUnit` to a value
                other than one, you would typically set Rounding to **UP**. For example,
                suppose you charge by kilobytes per second (KiBy/s), set `quantityPerUnit` =
                500, and set charge rate at $0.25 per unit used. If your customer used 48,900
                KiBy/s in a billing period, the charge would be 48,900 / 500 = 97.8 rounded up
                to 98 \\** 0.25 = $2.45.

              Enum: ???UP??? ???DOWN??? ???NEAREST??? ???NONE???

          unit: User defined label for units shown for Bill line items, indicating to your
              customers what they are being charged for.

          accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Aggregation should be attributed to for accounting
              purposes.

          code: Code of the new Aggregation. A unique short code to identify the Aggregation.

          evaluate_null_aggregations:
              Boolean True / False flag:

              - **TRUE** - set to TRUE if you want to allow null values from the simple
                Aggregations referenced in the Compound Aggregation to be passed in. Simple
                Aggregations based on Meter Target Fields where no usage data is available
                will have null values.
              - **FALSE** Default.

              **Note:** If any of the simple Aggregations you reference in a Compound
              Aggregation calculation might have null values, you must set their Default Value
              to 0. This ensures that any null values passed into the Compound Aggregation are
              passed in correctly with value = 0.

          product_id: Unique identifier (UUID) of the Product the CompoundAggregation belongs to.

              **Note:** Omit this parameter if you want to create a _Global_
              CompoundAggregation.

                response.
              - **Update Entity:** On Update, version is required and must match the existing

                preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.

        Create a new CompoundAggregation.

        This endpoint allows you to create a new CompoundAggregation for a specific
        Organization. The request body must include all the necessary details such as
        the Calculation formula.

        Args:
          calculation: String that represents the formula for the calculation. This formula determines
              how the CompoundAggregation value is calculated. The calculation can reference
              simple Aggregations or Custom Fields. This field is required when creating or
              updating a CompoundAggregation.

              **NOTE:** If a simple Aggregation referenced by a Compound Aggregation has a
              **Quantity per unit** defined or a **Rounding** defined, these will not be
              factored into the value used by the calculation. For example, if the simple
              Aggregation referenced has a base value of 100 and has **Quantity per unit** set
              at 10, the Compound Aggregation calculation _will use the base value of 100 not
              10_.

          name: Descriptive name for the Aggregation.

          quantity_per_unit: Defines how much of a quantity equates to 1 unit. Used when setting the price
              per unit for billing purposes - if charging for kilobytes per second (KiBy/s) at
              rate of $0.25 per 500 KiBy/s, then set quantityPerUnit to 500 and price Plan at
              $0.25 per unit.

              **Note:** If `quantityPerUnit` is set to a value other than one, `rounding` is
              typically set to `"UP"`.

          rounding: Specifies how you want to deal with non-integer, fractional number Aggregation
              values.

              **NOTES:**

              - **NEAREST** rounds to the nearest half: 5.1 is rounded to 5, and 3.5 is
                rounded to 4.
              - Also used in combination with `quantityPerUnit`. Rounds the number of units
                after `quantityPerUnit` is applied. If you set `quantityPerUnit` to a value
                other than one, you would typically set Rounding to **UP**. For example,
                suppose you charge by kilobytes per second (KiBy/s), set `quantityPerUnit` =
                500, and set charge rate at $0.25 per unit used. If your customer used 48,900
                KiBy/s in a billing period, the charge would be 48,900 / 500 = 97.8 rounded up
                to 98 \\** 0.25 = $2.45.

              Enum: ???UP??? ???DOWN??? ???NEAREST??? ???NONE???

          unit: User defined label for units shown for Bill line items, indicating to your
              customers what they are being charged for.

          accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Aggregation should be attributed to for accounting
              purposes.

          code: Code of the new Aggregation. A unique short code to identify the Aggregation.

          evaluate_null_aggregations:
              Boolean True / False flag:

              - **TRUE** - set to TRUE if you want to allow null values from the simple
                Aggregations referenced in the Compound Aggregation to be passed in. Simple
                Aggregations based on Meter Target Fields where no usage data is available
                will have null values.
              - **FALSE** Default.

              **Note:** If any of the simple Aggregations you reference in a Compound
              Aggregation calculation might have null values, you must set their Default Value
              to 0. This ensures that any null values passed into the Compound Aggregation are
              passed in correctly with value = 0.

          product_id: Unique identifier (UUID) of the Product the CompoundAggregation belongs to.

              **Note:** Omit this parameter if you want to create a _Global_
              CompoundAggregation.

        Retrieve a list of all CompoundAggregations.

        This endpoint retrieves a list of CompoundAggregations associated with a
        specific organization. CompoundAggregations enable you to define numerical
        measures based on simple Aggregations of usage data. It supports pagination, and
        includes various query parameters to filter the CompoundAggregations based on
        Product, CompoundAggregation IDs or short codes.

        Args:
          codes: An optional parameter to retrieve specific CompoundAggregations based on their
              short codes.

          ids: An optional parameter to retrieve specific CompoundAggregations based on their
              unique identifiers (UUIDs).

          next_token: The `nextToken` for multi-page retrievals. It is used to fetch the next page of
              CompoundAggregations in a paginated list.

          page_size: Specifies the maximum number of CompoundAggregations to retrieve per page.

          product_id: An optional parameter to filter the CompoundAggregations based on specific
              Product unique identifiers (UUIDs).
