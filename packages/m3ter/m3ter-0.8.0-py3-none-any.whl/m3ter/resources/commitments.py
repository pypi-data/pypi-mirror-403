        """Create a new Commitment.

        Creates a new Commitment for an Organization.

        The request body must include all
        the necessary details such as the agreed amount, overage surcharge percentage,
        and the associated account and product details.

        **Note:** If some of the agreed Commitment amount remains unpaid at the start of
        an end-customer contract period, when you create a Commitment for an Account you
        can set up billing for the outstanding amount in one of two ways:

        - Select a Product _Plan to bill with_. Use the `billingPlanId` request
          parameter to select the Plan used for billing.
        - Define a _schedule of billing dates_. Omit a `billingPlanId` and use the
          `feeDates` request parameter to define a precise schedule of bill dates and
          amounts.

        Args:
          account_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for the end customer Account the Commitment is
              added to.

          amount: The total amount that the customer has committed to pay.

          currency: The currency used for the Commitment. For example: USD.

          end_date: The end date of the Commitment period in ISO-8601 format.

              **Note:** End date is exclusive - if you set an end date of June 1st 2022, then
              the Commitment ceases to be active for the Account at midnight on May 31st 2022,
              and any Prepayment fees due are calculated up to that point in time, NOT up to
              midnight on June 1st

          start_date: The start date of the Commitment period in ISO-8601 format.

          accounting_product_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for the Product linked to the Commitment for
              accounting purposes. _(Optional)_

              **NOTE:** If you're planning to set up an integration for sending Bills to an
              external accounts receivable system, please check requirements for your chosen
              system. Some systems, such as NetSuite, require a Product to be linked with any
              Bill line items associated with Account Commitments, and the integration will
              fail if this is not present

          amount_first_bill: The amount to be billed in the first invoice.

          amount_pre_paid: The amount that the customer has already paid upfront at the start of the
              Commitment service period.

          bill_epoch: The starting date _(in ISO-8601 date format)_ from which the billing cycles are
              calculated.

          billing_interval: How often the Commitment fees are applied to bills. For example, if the plan
              being used to bill for Commitment fees is set to issue bills every three months
              and the `billingInterval` is set to 2, then the Commitment fees are applied
              every six months.

          billing_offset: Defines an offset for when the Commitment fees are first applied to bills on the
              Account. For example, if bills are issued every three months and the
              `billingOffset` is 0, then the charge is applied to the first bill (at three
              months); if set to 1, it's applied to the next bill (at six months), and so on.

          billing_plan_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for the Product Plan used for billing Commitment
              fees due.

          child_billing_mode: If the Account is either a Parent or a Child Account, this specifies the Account
              hierarchy billing mode. The mode determines how billing will be handled and
              shown on bills for charges due on the Parent Account, and charges due on Child
              Accounts:

              - **Parent Breakdown** - a separate bill line item per Account. Default setting.

              - **Parent Summary** - single bill line item for all Accounts.

              - **Child** - the Child Account is billed.

          commitment_fee_bill_in_advance: A boolean value indicating whether the Commitment fee is billed in advance
              _(start of each billing period)_ or arrears _(end of each billing period)_.

              If no value is supplied, then the Organization Configuration value is used.

              - **TRUE** - bill in advance _(start of each billing period)_.
              - **FALSE** - bill in arrears _(end of each billing period)_.

          commitment_fee_description: A textual description of the Commitment fee.

          commitment_usage_description: A textual description of the Commitment usage.

          contract_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for a Contract you've created for the Account -
              used to add the Commitment to this Contract.

              **Note:** If you associate the Commitment with a Contract you must ensure the
              Account Plan attached to the Account has the same Contract associated with it.
              If the Account Plan Contract and Commitment Contract do not match, then at
              billing the Commitment amount will not be drawn-down against.

          drawdowns_accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Commitment's consumptions should be attributed to for
              accounting purposes.

          fee_dates: Used for billing any outstanding Commitment fees _on a schedule_.

              Create an array to define a series of bill dates and amounts covering specified
              service periods:

              - `date` - the billing date _(in ISO-8601 format)_.
              - `amount` - the billed amount.
              - `servicePeriodStartDate` and `servicePeriodEndDate` - defines the service
                period the bill covers _(in ISO-8601 format)_.

              **Notes:**

              - If you try to set `servicePeriodStartDate` _after_ `servicePeriodEndDate`,
                you'll receive an error.
              - You can set `servicePeriodStartDate` and `servicePeriodEndDate` to the _same
                date_ without receiving an error, but _please be sure_ your Commitment billing
                use case requires this.

          fees_accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Commitment's fees should be attributed to for
              accounting purposes.

          line_item_types: Specify the line item charge types that can draw-down at billing against the
              Commitment amount. Options are:

              - `MINIMUM_SPEND`
              - `STANDING_CHARGE`
              - `USAGE`
              - `"COUNTER_RUNNING_TOTAL_CHARGE"`
              - `"COUNTER_ADJUSTMENT_DEBIT"`

              **NOTE:** If no charge types are specified, by default _all types_ can draw-down
              against the Commitment amount at billing.

          overage_description: A textual description of the overage charges.

          overage_surcharge_percent: The percentage surcharge applied to usage charges that exceed the Commitment
              amount.

              **Note:** You can enter a _negative percentage_ if you want to give a discount
              rate for usage to end customers who exceed their Commitment amount

          product_ids: A list of unique identifiers (UUIDs) for Products the Account consumes. Charges
              due for these Products will be made available for draw-down against the
              Commitment.

              **Note:** If not used, then charges due for all Products the Account consumes
              will be made available for draw-down against the Commitment.

          separate_overage_usage: A boolean value indicating whether the overage usage is billed separately or
              together. If overage usage is separated and a Commitment amount has been
              consumed by an Account, any subsequent line items on Bills against the Account
              for usage will show as separate "overage usage" charges, not simply as "usage"
              charges:

              - **TRUE** - billed separately.
              - **FALSE** - billed together.

              **Notes:**

              - Can be used only if no value or 0 has been defined for the
                `overageSurchargePercent` parameter. If you try to separate overage usage when
                a value other than 0 has been defined for `overageSurchargePercent`, you'll
                receive an error.
              - If a priced Plan is used to bill any outstanding Commitment fees due and the
                Plan is set up with overage pricing on a _tiered pricing structure_ and you
                enable separate bill line items for overage usage, then overage usage charges
                will be rated according to the overage pricing defined for the tiered pricing
                on the Plan.

          version:
              The version number of the entity:

              - **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - _do not use
                for Create_. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the
                response.
              - **Update Entity:** On Update, version is required and must match the existing
                version because a check is performed to ensure sequential versioning is
                preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.

          accounting_product_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for the Product linked to the Commitment for
              accounting purposes. _(Optional)_

              **NOTE:** If you're planning to set up an integration for sending Bills to an
              external accounts receivable system, please check requirements for your chosen
              system. Some systems, such as NetSuite, require a Product to be linked with any
              Bill line items associated with Account Commitments, and the integration will
              fail if this is not present

          amount_first_bill: The amount to be billed in the first invoice.

          amount_pre_paid: The amount that the customer has already paid upfront at the start of the
              Commitment service period.

          bill_epoch: The starting date _(in ISO-8601 date format)_ from which the billing cycles are
              calculated.

          billing_interval: How often the Commitment fees are applied to bills. For example, if the plan
              being used to bill for Commitment fees is set to issue bills every three months
              and the `billingInterval` is set to 2, then the Commitment fees are applied
              every six months.

          billing_offset: Defines an offset for when the Commitment fees are first applied to bills on the
              Account. For example, if bills are issued every three months and the
              `billingOffset` is 0, then the charge is applied to the first bill (at three
              months); if set to 1, it's applied to the next bill (at six months), and so on.

          billing_plan_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for the Product Plan used for billing Commitment
              fees due.

          child_billing_mode: If the Account is either a Parent or a Child Account, this specifies the Account
              hierarchy billing mode. The mode determines how billing will be handled and
              shown on bills for charges due on the Parent Account, and charges due on Child
              Accounts:

              - **Parent Breakdown** - a separate bill line item per Account. Default setting.

              - **Parent Summary** - single bill line item for all Accounts.

              - **Child** - the Child Account is billed.

          commitment_fee_bill_in_advance: A boolean value indicating whether the Commitment fee is billed in advance
              _(start of each billing period)_ or arrears _(end of each billing period)_.

              If no value is supplied, then the Organization Configuration value is used.

              - **TRUE** - bill in advance _(start of each billing period)_.
              - **FALSE** - bill in arrears _(end of each billing period)_.

          commitment_fee_description: A textual description of the Commitment fee.

          commitment_usage_description: A textual description of the Commitment usage.

          contract_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for a Contract you've created for the Account -
              used to add the Commitment to this Contract.

              **Note:** If you associate the Commitment with a Contract you must ensure the
              Account Plan attached to the Account has the same Contract associated with it.
              If the Account Plan Contract and Commitment Contract do not match, then at
              billing the Commitment amount will not be drawn-down against.

          drawdowns_accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Commitment's consumptions should be attributed to for
              accounting purposes.

          fee_dates: Used for billing any outstanding Commitment fees _on a schedule_.

              Create an array to define a series of bill dates and amounts covering specified
              service periods:

              - `date` - the billing date _(in ISO-8601 format)_.
              - `amount` - the billed amount.
              - `servicePeriodStartDate` and `servicePeriodEndDate` - defines the service
                period the bill covers _(in ISO-8601 format)_.

              **Notes:**

              - If you try to set `servicePeriodStartDate` _after_ `servicePeriodEndDate`,
                you'll receive an error.
              - You can set `servicePeriodStartDate` and `servicePeriodEndDate` to the _same
                date_ without receiving an error, but _please be sure_ your Commitment billing
                use case requires this.

          fees_accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Commitment's fees should be attributed to for
              accounting purposes.

          line_item_types: Specify the line item charge types that can draw-down at billing against the
              Commitment amount. Options are:

              - `MINIMUM_SPEND`
              - `STANDING_CHARGE`
              - `USAGE`
              - `"COUNTER_RUNNING_TOTAL_CHARGE"`
              - `"COUNTER_ADJUSTMENT_DEBIT"`

              **NOTE:** If no charge types are specified, by default _all types_ can draw-down
              against the Commitment amount at billing.

          overage_description: A textual description of the overage charges.

          overage_surcharge_percent: The percentage surcharge applied to usage charges that exceed the Commitment
              amount.

              **Note:** You can enter a _negative percentage_ if you want to give a discount
              rate for usage to end customers who exceed their Commitment amount

          product_ids: A list of unique identifiers (UUIDs) for Products the Account consumes. Charges
              due for these Products will be made available for draw-down against the
              Commitment.

              **Note:** If not used, then charges due for all Products the Account consumes
              will be made available for draw-down against the Commitment.

          separate_overage_usage: A boolean value indicating whether the overage usage is billed separately or
              together. If overage usage is separated and a Commitment amount has been
              consumed by an Account, any subsequent line items on Bills against the Account
              for usage will show as separate "overage usage" charges, not simply as "usage"
              charges:

              - **TRUE** - billed separately.
              - **FALSE** - billed together.

              **Notes:**

              - Can be used only if no value or 0 has been defined for the
                `overageSurchargePercent` parameter. If you try to separate overage usage when
                a value other than 0 has been defined for `overageSurchargePercent`, you'll
                receive an error.
              - If a priced Plan is used to bill any outstanding Commitment fees due and the
                Plan is set up with overage pricing on a _tiered pricing structure_ and you
                enable separate bill line items for overage usage, then overage usage charges
                will be rated according to the overage pricing defined for the tiered pricing
                on the Plan.

          version:
              The version number of the entity:

              - **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - _do not use
                for Create_. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the
                response.
              - **Update Entity:** On Update, version is required and must match the existing
                version because a check is performed to ensure sequential versioning is
                preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.

                productIds, id, createdBy, dtCreated, lastModifiedBy, ids.
              - Query example:
                - searchQuery=startDate>2023-01-01$accountId:062085ab-a301-4f21-a081-411020864452.

                  062085ab-a301-4f21-a081-411020864452.

              **Note:** Using the ~ match phrase/prefix comparator. For best results, we
              recommend treating this as a "starts with" comparator for your search query.

          sort_by: Name of the parameter on which sorting is performed. Use any field available on

        Creates a new Commitment for an Organization.

        The request body must include all
        the necessary details such as the agreed amount, overage surcharge percentage,
        and the associated account and product details.

        **Note:** If some of the agreed Commitment amount remains unpaid at the start of
        an end-customer contract period, when you create a Commitment for an Account you
        can set up billing for the outstanding amount in one of two ways:

        - Select a Product _Plan to bill with_. Use the `billingPlanId` request
          parameter to select the Plan used for billing.
        - Define a _schedule of billing dates_. Omit a `billingPlanId` and use the
          `feeDates` request parameter to define a precise schedule of bill dates and
          amounts.

        Args:
          account_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for the end customer Account the Commitment is
              added to.

          amount: The total amount that the customer has committed to pay.

          currency: The currency used for the Commitment. For example: USD.

          end_date: The end date of the Commitment period in ISO-8601 format.

              **Note:** End date is exclusive - if you set an end date of June 1st 2022, then
              the Commitment ceases to be active for the Account at midnight on May 31st 2022,
              and any Prepayment fees due are calculated up to that point in time, NOT up to
              midnight on June 1st

          start_date: The start date of the Commitment period in ISO-8601 format.

          accounting_product_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for the Product linked to the Commitment for
              accounting purposes. _(Optional)_

              **NOTE:** If you're planning to set up an integration for sending Bills to an
              external accounts receivable system, please check requirements for your chosen
              system. Some systems, such as NetSuite, require a Product to be linked with any
              Bill line items associated with Account Commitments, and the integration will
              fail if this is not present

          amount_first_bill: The amount to be billed in the first invoice.

          amount_pre_paid: The amount that the customer has already paid upfront at the start of the
              Commitment service period.

          bill_epoch: The starting date _(in ISO-8601 date format)_ from which the billing cycles are
              calculated.

          billing_interval: How often the Commitment fees are applied to bills. For example, if the plan
              being used to bill for Commitment fees is set to issue bills every three months
              and the `billingInterval` is set to 2, then the Commitment fees are applied
              every six months.

          billing_offset: Defines an offset for when the Commitment fees are first applied to bills on the
              Account. For example, if bills are issued every three months and the
              `billingOffset` is 0, then the charge is applied to the first bill (at three
              months); if set to 1, it's applied to the next bill (at six months), and so on.

          billing_plan_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for the Product Plan used for billing Commitment
              fees due.

          child_billing_mode: If the Account is either a Parent or a Child Account, this specifies the Account
              hierarchy billing mode. The mode determines how billing will be handled and
              shown on bills for charges due on the Parent Account, and charges due on Child
              Accounts:

              - **Parent Breakdown** - a separate bill line item per Account. Default setting.

              - **Parent Summary** - single bill line item for all Accounts.

              - **Child** - the Child Account is billed.

          commitment_fee_bill_in_advance: A boolean value indicating whether the Commitment fee is billed in advance
              _(start of each billing period)_ or arrears _(end of each billing period)_.

              If no value is supplied, then the Organization Configuration value is used.

              - **TRUE** - bill in advance _(start of each billing period)_.
              - **FALSE** - bill in arrears _(end of each billing period)_.

          commitment_fee_description: A textual description of the Commitment fee.

          commitment_usage_description: A textual description of the Commitment usage.

          contract_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for a Contract you've created for the Account -
              used to add the Commitment to this Contract.

              **Note:** If you associate the Commitment with a Contract you must ensure the
              Account Plan attached to the Account has the same Contract associated with it.
              If the Account Plan Contract and Commitment Contract do not match, then at
              billing the Commitment amount will not be drawn-down against.

          drawdowns_accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Commitment's consumptions should be attributed to for
              accounting purposes.

          fee_dates: Used for billing any outstanding Commitment fees _on a schedule_.

              Create an array to define a series of bill dates and amounts covering specified
              service periods:

              - `date` - the billing date _(in ISO-8601 format)_.
              - `amount` - the billed amount.
              - `servicePeriodStartDate` and `servicePeriodEndDate` - defines the service
                period the bill covers _(in ISO-8601 format)_.

              **Notes:**

              - If you try to set `servicePeriodStartDate` _after_ `servicePeriodEndDate`,
                you'll receive an error.
              - You can set `servicePeriodStartDate` and `servicePeriodEndDate` to the _same
                date_ without receiving an error, but _please be sure_ your Commitment billing
                use case requires this.

          fees_accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Commitment's fees should be attributed to for
              accounting purposes.

          line_item_types: Specify the line item charge types that can draw-down at billing against the
              Commitment amount. Options are:

              - `MINIMUM_SPEND`
              - `STANDING_CHARGE`
              - `USAGE`
              - `"COUNTER_RUNNING_TOTAL_CHARGE"`
              - `"COUNTER_ADJUSTMENT_DEBIT"`

              **NOTE:** If no charge types are specified, by default _all types_ can draw-down
              against the Commitment amount at billing.

          overage_description: A textual description of the overage charges.

          overage_surcharge_percent: The percentage surcharge applied to usage charges that exceed the Commitment
              amount.

              **Note:** You can enter a _negative percentage_ if you want to give a discount
              rate for usage to end customers who exceed their Commitment amount

          product_ids: A list of unique identifiers (UUIDs) for Products the Account consumes. Charges
              due for these Products will be made available for draw-down against the
              Commitment.

              **Note:** If not used, then charges due for all Products the Account consumes
              will be made available for draw-down against the Commitment.

          separate_overage_usage: A boolean value indicating whether the overage usage is billed separately or
              together. If overage usage is separated and a Commitment amount has been
              consumed by an Account, any subsequent line items on Bills against the Account
              for usage will show as separate "overage usage" charges, not simply as "usage"
              charges:

              - **TRUE** - billed separately.
              - **FALSE** - billed together.

              **Notes:**

              - Can be used only if no value or 0 has been defined for the
                `overageSurchargePercent` parameter. If you try to separate overage usage when
                a value other than 0 has been defined for `overageSurchargePercent`, you'll
                receive an error.
              - If a priced Plan is used to bill any outstanding Commitment fees due and the
                Plan is set up with overage pricing on a _tiered pricing structure_ and you
                enable separate bill line items for overage usage, then overage usage charges
                will be rated according to the overage pricing defined for the tiered pricing
                on the Plan.

          version:
              The version number of the entity:

              - **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - _do not use
                for Create_. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the
                response.
              - **Update Entity:** On Update, version is required and must match the existing
                version because a check is performed to ensure sequential versioning is
                preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.

              **Note:** End date is exclusive - if you set an end date of June 1st 2022, then
              the Commitment ceases to be active for the Account at midnight on May 31st 2022,
              and any Prepayment fees due are calculated up to that point in time, NOT up to
              midnight on June 1st

          start_date: The start date of the Commitment period in ISO-8601 format.

          accounting_product_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for the Product linked to the Commitment for
              accounting purposes. _(Optional)_

              **NOTE:** If you're planning to set up an integration for sending Bills to an
              external accounts receivable system, please check requirements for your chosen
              system. Some systems, such as NetSuite, require a Product to be linked with any
              Bill line items associated with Account Commitments, and the integration will
              fail if this is not present

          amount_first_bill: The amount to be billed in the first invoice.

          amount_pre_paid: The amount that the customer has already paid upfront at the start of the
              Commitment service period.

          bill_epoch: The starting date _(in ISO-8601 date format)_ from which the billing cycles are
              calculated.

          billing_interval: How often the Commitment fees are applied to bills. For example, if the plan
              being used to bill for Commitment fees is set to issue bills every three months
              and the `billingInterval` is set to 2, then the Commitment fees are applied
              every six months.

          billing_offset: Defines an offset for when the Commitment fees are first applied to bills on the
              Account. For example, if bills are issued every three months and the
              `billingOffset` is 0, then the charge is applied to the first bill (at three
              months); if set to 1, it's applied to the next bill (at six months), and so on.

          billing_plan_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for the Product Plan used for billing Commitment
              fees due.

          child_billing_mode: If the Account is either a Parent or a Child Account, this specifies the Account
              hierarchy billing mode. The mode determines how billing will be handled and
              shown on bills for charges due on the Parent Account, and charges due on Child
              Accounts:

              - **Parent Breakdown** - a separate bill line item per Account. Default setting.

              - **Parent Summary** - single bill line item for all Accounts.

              - **Child** - the Child Account is billed.

          commitment_fee_bill_in_advance: A boolean value indicating whether the Commitment fee is billed in advance
              _(start of each billing period)_ or arrears _(end of each billing period)_.

              If no value is supplied, then the Organization Configuration value is used.

              - **TRUE** - bill in advance _(start of each billing period)_.
              - **FALSE** - bill in arrears _(end of each billing period)_.

          commitment_fee_description: A textual description of the Commitment fee.

          commitment_usage_description: A textual description of the Commitment usage.

          contract_id: The unique identifier (UUID) for a Contract you've created for the Account -
              used to add the Commitment to this Contract.

              **Note:** If you associate the Commitment with a Contract you must ensure the
              Account Plan attached to the Account has the same Contract associated with it.
              If the Account Plan Contract and Commitment Contract do not match, then at
              billing the Commitment amount will not be drawn-down against.

          drawdowns_accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Commitment's consumptions should be attributed to for
              accounting purposes.

          fee_dates: Used for billing any outstanding Commitment fees _on a schedule_.

              Create an array to define a series of bill dates and amounts covering specified
              service periods:

              - `date` - the billing date _(in ISO-8601 format)_.
              - `amount` - the billed amount.
              - `servicePeriodStartDate` and `servicePeriodEndDate` - defines the service
                period the bill covers _(in ISO-8601 format)_.

              **Notes:**

              - If you try to set `servicePeriodStartDate` _after_ `servicePeriodEndDate`,
                you'll receive an error.
              - You can set `servicePeriodStartDate` and `servicePeriodEndDate` to the _same
                date_ without receiving an error, but _please be sure_ your Commitment billing
                use case requires this.

          fees_accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Commitment's fees should be attributed to for
              accounting purposes.

          line_item_types: Specify the line item charge types that can draw-down at billing against the
              Commitment amount. Options are:

              - `MINIMUM_SPEND`
              - `STANDING_CHARGE`
              - `USAGE`
              - `"COUNTER_RUNNING_TOTAL_CHARGE"`
              - `"COUNTER_ADJUSTMENT_DEBIT"`

              **NOTE:** If no charge types are specified, by default _all types_ can draw-down
              against the Commitment amount at billing.

          overage_description: A textual description of the overage charges.

          overage_surcharge_percent: The percentage surcharge applied to usage charges that exceed the Commitment
              amount.

              **Note:** You can enter a _negative percentage_ if you want to give a discount
              rate for usage to end customers who exceed their Commitment amount

          product_ids: A list of unique identifiers (UUIDs) for Products the Account consumes. Charges
              due for these Products will be made available for draw-down against the
              Commitment.

              **Note:** If not used, then charges due for all Products the Account consumes
              will be made available for draw-down against the Commitment.

          separate_overage_usage: A boolean value indicating whether the overage usage is billed separately or
              together. If overage usage is separated and a Commitment amount has been
              consumed by an Account, any subsequent line items on Bills against the Account
              for usage will show as separate "overage usage" charges, not simply as "usage"
              charges:

              - **TRUE** - billed separately.
              - **FALSE** - billed together.

              **Notes:**

              - Can be used only if no value or 0 has been defined for the
                `overageSurchargePercent` parameter. If you try to separate overage usage when
                a value other than 0 has been defined for `overageSurchargePercent`, you'll
                receive an error.
              - If a priced Plan is used to bill any outstanding Commitment fees due and the
                Plan is set up with overage pricing on a _tiered pricing structure_ and you
                enable separate bill line items for overage usage, then overage usage charges
                will be rated according to the overage pricing defined for the tiered pricing
                on the Plan.

          version:
              The version number of the entity:

              - **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - _do not use
                for Create_. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the
                response.
              - **Update Entity:** On Update, version is required and must match the existing
                version because a check is performed to ensure sequential versioning is
                preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.

                  062085ab-a301-4f21-a081-411020864452.

              **Note:** Using the ~ match phrase/prefix comparator. For best results, we
              recommend treating this as a "starts with" comparator for your search query.

          sort_by: Name of the parameter on which sorting is performed. Use any field available on
