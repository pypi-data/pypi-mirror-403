              - **None**. Statements will not be auto-generated.
              - **JSON**. Statements are auto-generated in JSON format.
              - **JSON and CSV**. Statements are auto-generated in both JSON and CSV formats.

          bill_epoch: Optional setting to define a _billing cycle date_, which sets the date of the
              first Bill and acts as a reference for when in the applied billing frequency
              period subsequent bills are created:

              - For example, if you attach a Plan to an Account where the Plan is configured
                for monthly billing frequency and you've defined the period the Plan will
                apply to the Account to be from January 1st, 2022 until January 1st, 2023. You
                then set a `billEpoch` date of February 15th, 2022. The first Bill will be
                created for the Account on February 15th, and subsequent Bills created on the
                15th of the months following for the remainder of the billing period - March
                15th, April 15th, and so on.
              - If not defined, then the relevant Epoch date set for the billing frequency
                period at Organization level will be used instead.
              - The date is in ISO-8601 format.

          credit_application_order: Define the order in which any Prepayment or Balance amounts on the Account are
              to be drawn-down against for billing. Four options:

              - `"PREPAYMENT","BALANCE"`. Draw-down against Prepayment credit before Balance
                credit.
              - `"BALANCE","PREPAYMENT"`. Draw-down against Balance credit before Prepayment
                credit.
              - `"PREPAYMENT"`. Only draw-down against Prepayment credit.
              - `"BALANCE"`. Only draw-down against Balance credit.

              **NOTES:**

              - Any setting you define here overrides the setting for credit application order
                at Organization level.
              - If the Account belongs to a Parent/Child Account hierarchy, then the
                `creditApplicationOrder` settings are not available, and the draw-down order
                defaults always to Prepayment then Balance order.

          currency:
              Account level billing currency, such as USD or GBP. Optional attribute:

              - If you define an Account currency, this will be used for bills.
              - If you do not define a currency, the billing currency defined at
                Organizational level will be used.

              **Note:** If you've attached a Plan to the Account that uses a different
              currency to the billing currency, then you must add the relevant currency
              conversion rate at Organization level to ensure the billing process can convert
              line items calculated using the Plan currency into the selected billing
              currency. If you don't add these conversion rates, then bills will fail for the
              Account.

          custom_fields: User defined fields enabling you to attach custom data. The value for a custom
              field can be either a string or a number.

              If `customFields` can also be defined for this entity at the Organizational
              level, `customField` values defined at individual level override values of
              `customFields` with the same name defined at Organization level.

              See
              [Working with Custom Fields](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/creating-and-managing-products/working-with-custom-fields)
              in the m3ter documentation for more information.

          days_before_bill_due: Enter the number of days after the Bill generation date that you want to show on
              Bills as the due date.

              **Note:** If you define `daysBeforeBillDue` at individual Account level, this
              will take precedence over any `daysBeforeBillDue` setting defined at
              Organization level.

          parent_account_id: Parent Account ID, or null if this Account does not have a parent.

          purchase_order_number: Purchase Order Number of the Account.

              Optional attribute - allows you to set a purchase order number that comes
              through into invoicing. For example, your financial systems might require this
              as a reference for clearing payments.

          statement_definition_id: The UUID of the statement definition used when Bill statements are generated for
              the Account. If no statement definition is specified for the Account, the
              statement definition specified at Organizational level is used.

              Bill statements can be used as informative backing sheets to invoices. Based on
              the usage breakdown defined in the statement definition, generated statements
              give a breakdown of usage charges on Account Bills, which helps customers better
              understand usage charges incurred over the billing period.

              See

                parentAccountId, codes, id, createdBy, dtCreated, lastModifiedBy, ids.
              - Query example:
                - searchQuery=name~Premium On$currency:USD.
                - This query is translated into: find accounts whose name contains the
                  phrase/prefix 'Premium On' AND the account currency is USD.

              **Note:** Using the ~ match phrase/prefix comparator. For best results, we
              recommend treating this as a "starts with" comparator for your search query.

          sort_by: Name of the parameter on which sorting is performed. Use any field available on
              the Account entity to sort by, such as `name`, `code`, and so on.

              - `"BALANCE","PREPAYMENT"`. Draw-down against Balance credit before Prepayment
                credit.
              - `"PREPAYMENT"`. Only draw-down against Prepayment credit.
              - `"BALANCE"`. Only draw-down against Balance credit.

              **NOTES:**

              - Any setting you define here overrides the setting for credit application order
                at Organization level.
              - If the Account belongs to a Parent/Child Account hierarchy, then the
                `creditApplicationOrder` settings are not available, and the draw-down order
                defaults always to Prepayment then Balance order.

          currency:
              Account level billing currency, such as USD or GBP. Optional attribute:

              - If you define an Account currency, this will be used for bills.
              - If you do not define a currency, the billing currency defined at
                Organizational level will be used.

              **Note:** If you've attached a Plan to the Account that uses a different
              currency to the billing currency, then you must add the relevant currency
              conversion rate at Organization level to ensure the billing process can convert
              line items calculated using the Plan currency into the selected billing
              currency. If you don't add these conversion rates, then bills will fail for the
              Account.

          custom_fields: User defined fields enabling you to attach custom data. The value for a custom
              field can be either a string or a number.

              If `customFields` can also be defined for this entity at the Organizational
              level, `customField` values defined at individual level override values of
              `customFields` with the same name defined at Organization level.

              See
              [Working with Custom Fields](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/creating-and-managing-products/working-with-custom-fields)
              in the m3ter documentation for more information.

          days_before_bill_due: Enter the number of days after the Bill generation date that you want to show on
              Bills as the due date.

              **Note:** If you define `daysBeforeBillDue` at individual Account level, this
              will take precedence over any `daysBeforeBillDue` setting defined at
              Organization level.

          parent_account_id: Parent Account ID, or null if this Account does not have a parent.

          purchase_order_number: Purchase Order Number of the Account.

              Optional attribute - allows you to set a purchase order number that comes
              through into invoicing. For example, your financial systems might require this
              as a reference for clearing payments.

          statement_definition_id: The UUID of the statement definition used when Bill statements are generated for
              the Account. If no statement definition is specified for the Account, the
              statement definition specified at Organizational level is used.

              Bill statements can be used as informative backing sheets to invoices. Based on
              the usage breakdown defined in the statement definition, generated statements
              give a breakdown of usage charges on Account Bills, which helps customers better
              understand usage charges incurred over the billing period.

              See
              [Working with Bill Statements](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/running-viewing-and-managing-bills/working-with-bill-statements)

              - **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - _do not use

                response.
              - **Update Entity:** On Update, version is required and must match the existing

                preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.

        Args:
          code: Code of the Account. This is a unique short code used for the Account.

          email_address: Contact email for the Account.

          name: Name of the Account.

          address: Contact address.

          auto_generate_statement_mode: Specify whether to auto-generate statements once Bills are approved or locked.

              - **None**. Statements will not be auto-generated.
              - **JSON**. Statements are auto-generated in JSON format.
              - **JSON and CSV**. Statements are auto-generated in both JSON and CSV formats.

          bill_epoch: Optional setting to define a _billing cycle date_, which sets the date of the
              first Bill and acts as a reference for when in the applied billing frequency
              period subsequent bills are created:

              - For example, if you attach a Plan to an Account where the Plan is configured
                for monthly billing frequency and you've defined the period the Plan will
                apply to the Account to be from January 1st, 2022 until January 1st, 2023. You
                then set a `billEpoch` date of February 15th, 2022. The first Bill will be
                created for the Account on February 15th, and subsequent Bills created on the
                15th of the months following for the remainder of the billing period - March
                15th, April 15th, and so on.
              - If not defined, then the relevant Epoch date set for the billing frequency
                period at Organization level will be used instead.
              - The date is in ISO-8601 format.

          credit_application_order: Define the order in which any Prepayment or Balance amounts on the Account are
              to be drawn-down against for billing. Four options:

              - `"PREPAYMENT","BALANCE"`. Draw-down against Prepayment credit before Balance
                credit.
              - `"BALANCE","PREPAYMENT"`. Draw-down against Balance credit before Prepayment
                credit.
              - `"PREPAYMENT"`. Only draw-down against Prepayment credit.
              - `"BALANCE"`. Only draw-down against Balance credit.

              **NOTES:**

              - Any setting you define here overrides the setting for credit application order
                at Organization level.
              - If the Account belongs to a Parent/Child Account hierarchy, then the
                `creditApplicationOrder` settings are not available, and the draw-down order
                defaults always to Prepayment then Balance order.

          currency:
              Account level billing currency, such as USD or GBP. Optional attribute:

              - If you define an Account currency, this will be used for bills.
              - If you do not define a currency, the billing currency defined at
                Organizational level will be used.

              **Note:** If you've attached a Plan to the Account that uses a different
              currency to the billing currency, then you must add the relevant currency
              conversion rate at Organization level to ensure the billing process can convert
              line items calculated using the Plan currency into the selected billing
              currency. If you don't add these conversion rates, then bills will fail for the
              Account.

          custom_fields: User defined fields enabling you to attach custom data. The value for a custom
              field can be either a string or a number.

              If `customFields` can also be defined for this entity at the Organizational
              level, `customField` values defined at individual level override values of
              `customFields` with the same name defined at Organization level.

              See
              [Working with Custom Fields](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/creating-and-managing-products/working-with-custom-fields)
              in the m3ter documentation for more information.

          days_before_bill_due: Enter the number of days after the Bill generation date that you want to show on
              Bills as the due date.

              **Note:** If you define `daysBeforeBillDue` at individual Account level, this
              will take precedence over any `daysBeforeBillDue` setting defined at
              Organization level.

          parent_account_id: Parent Account ID, or null if this Account does not have a parent.

          purchase_order_number: Purchase Order Number of the Account.

              Optional attribute - allows you to set a purchase order number that comes
              through into invoicing. For example, your financial systems might require this
              as a reference for clearing payments.

          statement_definition_id: The UUID of the statement definition used when Bill statements are generated for
              the Account. If no statement definition is specified for the Account, the
              statement definition specified at Organizational level is used.

              Bill statements can be used as informative backing sheets to invoices. Based on
              the usage breakdown defined in the statement definition, generated statements
              give a breakdown of usage charges on Account Bills, which helps customers better

        Search for Account entities.

        This endpoint executes a search query for Accounts based on the user specified
        search criteria. The search query is customizable, allowing for complex nested
        conditions and sorting. The returned list of Accounts can be paginated for
        easier management.

        Args:
          from_document: `fromDocument` for multi page retrievals.

          operator: Search Operator to be used while querying search.

          page_size: Number of Accounts to retrieve per page.

              **NOTE:** If not defined, default is 10.

          search_query:
              Query for data using special syntax:

              - Query parameters should be delimited using the $ (dollar sign).
              - Allowed comparators are:
                - (greater than) >
                - (greater than or equal to) >=
                - (equal to) :
                - (less than) <
                - (less than or equal to) <=
                - (match phrase/prefix) ~
              - Allowed parameters are: name, code, currency, purchaseOrderNumber,
                parentAccountId, codes, id, createdBy, dtCreated, lastModifiedBy, ids.
              - Query example:
                - searchQuery=name~Premium On$currency:USD.
                - This query is translated into: find accounts whose name contains the
                  phrase/prefix 'Premium On' AND the account currency is USD.

              **Note:** Using the ~ match phrase/prefix comparator. For best results, we
              recommend treating this as a "starts with" comparator for your search query.

          sort_by: Name of the parameter on which sorting is performed. Use any field available on
              the Account entity to sort by, such as `name`, `code`, and so on.

          sort_order: Sorting order.
