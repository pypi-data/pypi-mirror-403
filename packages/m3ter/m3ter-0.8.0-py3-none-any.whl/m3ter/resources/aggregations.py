        Create a new Aggregation.

        Args:
          aggregation: Specifies the computation method applied to usage data collected in
              `targetField`. Aggregation unit value depends on the **Category** configured for
              the selected `targetField`.

              Enum:

              - **SUM**. Adds the values. Can be applied to a **Measure**, **Income**, or
                **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **MIN**. Uses the minimum value. Can be applied to a **Measure**, **Income**,
                or **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **MAX**. Uses the maximum value. Can be applied to a **Measure**, **Income**,
                or **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **COUNT**. Counts the number of values. Can be applied to a **Measure**,
                **Income**, or **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **LATEST**. Uses the most recent value. Can be applied to a **Measure**,
                **Income**, or **Cost** `targetField`. Note: Based on the timestamp (`ts`)
                value of usage data measurement submissions. If using this method, please
                ensure _distinct_ `ts` values are used for usage data measurment submissions.

              - **MEAN**. Uses the arithmetic mean of the values. Can be applied to a
                **Measure**, **Income**, or **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **UNIQUE**. Uses unique values and returns a count of the number of unique
                values. Can be applied to a **Metadata** `targetField`.

              - **CUSTOM_SQL**. Uses an SQL query expression. If you select this Aggregation
                type, use the `customSQL` request parameter to enter an SQL query.

          meter_id: The UUID of the Meter used as the source of usage data for the Aggregation.

              Each Aggregation is a child of a Meter, so the Meter must be selected.

          name: Descriptive name for the Aggregation.

          quantity_per_unit: Defines how much of a quantity equates to 1 unit. Used when setting the price
              per unit for billing purposes - if charging for kilobytes per second (KiBy/s) at
              rate of $0.25 per 500 KiBy/s, then set quantityPerUnit to 500 and price Plan at
              $0.25 per unit.

              **Note:** If `quantityPerUnit` is set to a value other than one, `rounding` is
              typically set to `"UP"`.

          rounding: Specifies how you want to deal with non-integer, fractional number Aggregation
              values.

              **NOTES:**

              - **NEAREST** rounds to the nearest half: 5.1 is rounded to 5, and 3.5 is
                rounded to 4.
              - Also used in combination with `quantityPerUnit`. Rounds the number of units
                after `quantityPerUnit` is applied. If you set `quantityPerUnit` to a value
                other than one, you would typically set Rounding to **UP**. For example,
                suppose you charge by kilobytes per second (KiBy/s), set `quantityPerUnit` =
                500, and set charge rate at $0.25 per unit used. If your customer used 48,900
                KiBy/s in a billing period, the charge would be 48,900 / 500 = 97.8 rounded up
                to 98 \\** 0.25 = $2.45.

              Enum: ???UP??? ???DOWN??? ???NEAREST??? ???NONE???

          target_field: `Code` of the target `dataField` or `derivedField` on the Meter used as the
              basis for the Aggregation.

          unit: User defined label for units shown for Bill line items, indicating to your
              customers what they are being charged for.

          accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Aggregation should be attributed to for accounting
              purposes.

          code: Code of the new Aggregation. A unique short code to identify the Aggregation.

          custom_sql: Enter the SQL query expression to be used for a Custom SQL Aggregation. Custom
              SQL queries should be run against the Measurements table - for more details see
              [Custom SQL Aggregations](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/usage-data-aggregations/custom-sql-aggregations)
              in your main User documentation.

              **NOTE:** The `customSql` Aggregation type is currently available in Preview
              release. If you are interested in using this feature, please get in touch with
              m3ter Support or your m3ter contact.

          default_value: Aggregation value used when no usage data is available to be aggregated.
              _(Optional)_.

              **Note:** Set to 0, if you expect to reference the Aggregation in a Compound
              Aggregation. This ensures that any null values are passed in correctly to the
              Compound Aggregation calculation with a value = 0.

          segmented_fields: _(Optional)_. Used when creating a segmented Aggregation, which segments the
              usage data collected by a single Meter. Works together with `segments`.

              Enter the `Codes` of the fields in the target Meter to use for segmentation
              purposes.

              String `dataFields` on the target Meter can be segmented. Any string
              `derivedFields` on the target Meter, such as one that concatenates two string
              `dataFields`, can also be segmented.

          segments: _(Optional)_. Used when creating a segmented Aggregation, which segments the
              usage data collected by a single Meter. Works together with `segmentedFields`.

              Enter the values that are to be used as the segments, read from the fields in
              the meter pointed at by `segmentedFields`.

              Note that you can use _wildcards_ or _defaults_ when setting up segment values.
              For more details on how to do this with an example, see
              [Using Wildcards - API Calls](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/setting-up-usage-data-meters-and-aggregations/segmented-aggregations#using-wildcards---api-calls)

          version:
              The version number of the entity:

              - **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - _do not use
                for Create_. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the
                response.
              - **Update Entity:** On Update, version is required and must match the existing
                version because a check is performed to ensure sequential versioning is
                preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.

        Create a new Aggregation.

        Args:
          aggregation: Specifies the computation method applied to usage data collected in
              `targetField`. Aggregation unit value depends on the **Category** configured for
              the selected `targetField`.

              Enum:

              - **SUM**. Adds the values. Can be applied to a **Measure**, **Income**, or
                **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **MIN**. Uses the minimum value. Can be applied to a **Measure**, **Income**,
                or **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **MAX**. Uses the maximum value. Can be applied to a **Measure**, **Income**,
                or **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **COUNT**. Counts the number of values. Can be applied to a **Measure**,
                **Income**, or **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **LATEST**. Uses the most recent value. Can be applied to a **Measure**,
                **Income**, or **Cost** `targetField`. Note: Based on the timestamp (`ts`)
                value of usage data measurement submissions. If using this method, please
                ensure _distinct_ `ts` values are used for usage data measurment submissions.

              - **MEAN**. Uses the arithmetic mean of the values. Can be applied to a
                **Measure**, **Income**, or **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **UNIQUE**. Uses unique values and returns a count of the number of unique
                values. Can be applied to a **Metadata** `targetField`.

              - **CUSTOM_SQL**. Uses an SQL query expression. If you select this Aggregation
                type, use the `customSQL` request parameter to enter an SQL query.

          meter_id: The UUID of the Meter used as the source of usage data for the Aggregation.

              Each Aggregation is a child of a Meter, so the Meter must be selected.

          name: Descriptive name for the Aggregation.

          quantity_per_unit: Defines how much of a quantity equates to 1 unit. Used when setting the price
              per unit for billing purposes - if charging for kilobytes per second (KiBy/s) at
              rate of $0.25 per 500 KiBy/s, then set quantityPerUnit to 500 and price Plan at
              $0.25 per unit.

              **Note:** If `quantityPerUnit` is set to a value other than one, `rounding` is
              typically set to `"UP"`.

          rounding: Specifies how you want to deal with non-integer, fractional number Aggregation
              values.

              **NOTES:**

              - **NEAREST** rounds to the nearest half: 5.1 is rounded to 5, and 3.5 is
                rounded to 4.
              - Also used in combination with `quantityPerUnit`. Rounds the number of units
                after `quantityPerUnit` is applied. If you set `quantityPerUnit` to a value
                other than one, you would typically set Rounding to **UP**. For example,
                suppose you charge by kilobytes per second (KiBy/s), set `quantityPerUnit` =
                500, and set charge rate at $0.25 per unit used. If your customer used 48,900
                KiBy/s in a billing period, the charge would be 48,900 / 500 = 97.8 rounded up
                to 98 \\** 0.25 = $2.45.

              Enum: ???UP??? ???DOWN??? ???NEAREST??? ???NONE???

          target_field: `Code` of the target `dataField` or `derivedField` on the Meter used as the
              basis for the Aggregation.

          unit: User defined label for units shown for Bill line items, indicating to your
              customers what they are being charged for.

          accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Aggregation should be attributed to for accounting
              purposes.

          code: Code of the new Aggregation. A unique short code to identify the Aggregation.

          custom_sql: Enter the SQL query expression to be used for a Custom SQL Aggregation. Custom
              SQL queries should be run against the Measurements table - for more details see
              [Custom SQL Aggregations](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/usage-data-aggregations/custom-sql-aggregations)
              in your main User documentation.

              **NOTE:** The `customSql` Aggregation type is currently available in Preview
              release. If you are interested in using this feature, please get in touch with
              m3ter Support or your m3ter contact.

          default_value: Aggregation value used when no usage data is available to be aggregated.
              _(Optional)_.

              **Note:** Set to 0, if you expect to reference the Aggregation in a Compound
              Aggregation. This ensures that any null values are passed in correctly to the
              Compound Aggregation calculation with a value = 0.

          segmented_fields: _(Optional)_. Used when creating a segmented Aggregation, which segments the
              usage data collected by a single Meter. Works together with `segments`.

              Enter the `Codes` of the fields in the target Meter to use for segmentation
              purposes.

              String `dataFields` on the target Meter can be segmented. Any string
              `derivedFields` on the target Meter, such as one that concatenates two string
              `dataFields`, can also be segmented.

          segments: _(Optional)_. Used when creating a segmented Aggregation, which segments the
              usage data collected by a single Meter. Works together with `segmentedFields`.

              Enter the values that are to be used as the segments, read from the fields in
              the meter pointed at by `segmentedFields`.

              Note that you can use _wildcards_ or _defaults_ when setting up segment values.
              For more details on how to do this with an example, see
              [Using Wildcards - API Calls](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/setting-up-usage-data-meters-and-aggregations/segmented-aggregations#using-wildcards---api-calls)

        Update the Aggregation with the given UUID.

        **Note:** If you have created Custom Fields for an Aggregation, when you use
        this endpoint to update the Aggregation use the `customFields` parameter to
        preserve those Custom Fields. If you omit them from the update request, they
        will be lost.

        Args:
          aggregation: Specifies the computation method applied to usage data collected in
              `targetField`. Aggregation unit value depends on the **Category** configured for
              the selected `targetField`.

              Enum:

              - **SUM**. Adds the values. Can be applied to a **Measure**, **Income**, or
                **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **MIN**. Uses the minimum value. Can be applied to a **Measure**, **Income**,
                or **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **MAX**. Uses the maximum value. Can be applied to a **Measure**, **Income**,
                or **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **COUNT**. Counts the number of values. Can be applied to a **Measure**,
                **Income**, or **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **LATEST**. Uses the most recent value. Can be applied to a **Measure**,
                **Income**, or **Cost** `targetField`. Note: Based on the timestamp (`ts`)
                value of usage data measurement submissions. If using this method, please
                ensure _distinct_ `ts` values are used for usage data measurment submissions.

              - **MEAN**. Uses the arithmetic mean of the values. Can be applied to a
                **Measure**, **Income**, or **Cost** `targetField`.

              - **UNIQUE**. Uses unique values and returns a count of the number of unique
                values. Can be applied to a **Metadata** `targetField`.

              - **CUSTOM_SQL**. Uses an SQL query expression. If you select this Aggregation
                type, use the `customSQL` request parameter to enter an SQL query.

          meter_id: The UUID of the Meter used as the source of usage data for the Aggregation.

              Each Aggregation is a child of a Meter, so the Meter must be selected.

          name: Descriptive name for the Aggregation.

          quantity_per_unit: Defines how much of a quantity equates to 1 unit. Used when setting the price
              per unit for billing purposes - if charging for kilobytes per second (KiBy/s) at
              rate of $0.25 per 500 KiBy/s, then set quantityPerUnit to 500 and price Plan at
              $0.25 per unit.

              **Note:** If `quantityPerUnit` is set to a value other than one, `rounding` is
              typically set to `"UP"`.

          rounding: Specifies how you want to deal with non-integer, fractional number Aggregation
              values.

              **NOTES:**

              - **NEAREST** rounds to the nearest half: 5.1 is rounded to 5, and 3.5 is
                rounded to 4.
              - Also used in combination with `quantityPerUnit`. Rounds the number of units
                after `quantityPerUnit` is applied. If you set `quantityPerUnit` to a value
                other than one, you would typically set Rounding to **UP**. For example,
                suppose you charge by kilobytes per second (KiBy/s), set `quantityPerUnit` =
                500, and set charge rate at $0.25 per unit used. If your customer used 48,900
                KiBy/s in a billing period, the charge would be 48,900 / 500 = 97.8 rounded up
                to 98 \\** 0.25 = $2.45.

              Enum: ???UP??? ???DOWN??? ???NEAREST??? ???NONE???

          target_field: `Code` of the target `dataField` or `derivedField` on the Meter used as the
              basis for the Aggregation.

          unit: User defined label for units shown for Bill line items, indicating to your
              customers what they are being charged for.

          accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Aggregation should be attributed to for accounting
              purposes.

          code: Code of the new Aggregation. A unique short code to identify the Aggregation.

          custom_sql: Enter the SQL query expression to be used for a Custom SQL Aggregation. Custom
              SQL queries should be run against the Measurements table - for more details see
              [Custom SQL Aggregations](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/usage-data-aggregations/custom-sql-aggregations)
              in your main User documentation.

              **NOTE:** The `customSql` Aggregation type is currently available in Preview
              release. If you are interested in using this feature, please get in touch with
              m3ter Support or your m3ter contact.

          default_value: Aggregation value used when no usage data is available to be aggregated.
              _(Optional)_.

              **Note:** Set to 0, if you expect to reference the Aggregation in a Compound
              Aggregation. This ensures that any null values are passed in correctly to the
              Compound Aggregation calculation with a value = 0.

          segmented_fields: _(Optional)_. Used when creating a segmented Aggregation, which segments the
              usage data collected by a single Meter. Works together with `segments`.

              Enter the `Codes` of the fields in the target Meter to use for segmentation
              purposes.

              String `dataFields` on the target Meter can be segmented. Any string
              `derivedFields` on the target Meter, such as one that concatenates two string
              `dataFields`, can also be segmented.

          segments: _(Optional)_. Used when creating a segmented Aggregation, which segments the
              usage data collected by a single Meter. Works together with `segmentedFields`.

              Enter the values that are to be used as the segments, read from the fields in
              the meter pointed at by `segmentedFields`.

              Note that you can use _wildcards_ or _defaults_ when setting up segment values.
              For more details on how to do this with an example, see
              [Using Wildcards - API Calls](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/setting-up-usage-data-meters-and-aggregations/segmented-aggregations#using-wildcards---api-calls)
              in our main User Docs.

          version:
              The version number of the entity:

              - **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - _do not use
                for Create_. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the
                response.
              - **Update Entity:** On Update, version is required and must match the existing
                version because a check is performed to ensure sequential versioning is
                preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.
