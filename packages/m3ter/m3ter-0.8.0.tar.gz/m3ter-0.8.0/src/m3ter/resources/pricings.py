        **Notes:**

        - Exactly one of `planId` or `planTemplateId` request parameters are required
          for this call to be valid. If you omit both, then you will receive a
          validation error.
        - Exactly one of `aggregationId` or `compoundAggregationId` request parameters
          are required for this call to be valid. If you omit both, then you will
          receive a validation error.

        Args:
          pricing_bands

          start_date: The start date _(in ISO-8601 format)_ for when the Pricing starts to be active
              for the Plan of Plan Template._(Required)_

          accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Pricing should be attributed to for accounting purposes

          aggregation_id: UUID of the Aggregation used to create the Pricing. Use this when creating a
              Pricing for a segmented aggregation.

          code: Unique short code for the Pricing.

          compound_aggregation_id: UUID of the Compound Aggregation used to create the Pricing.

          cumulative: Controls whether or not charge rates under a set of pricing bands configured for
              a Pricing are applied according to each separate band or at the highest band
              reached.

              _(Optional)_. The default value is **FALSE**.

              - When TRUE, at billing charge rates are applied according to each separate
                band.

              - When FALSE, at billing charge rates are applied according to highest band
                reached.

              **NOTE:** Use the `cumulative` parameter to create the type of Pricing you
              require. For example, for Tiered Pricing set to **TRUE**; for Volume Pricing,
              set to **FALSE**.

          description: Displayed on Bill line items.

          end_date: The end date _(in ISO-8601 format)_ for when the Pricing ceases to be active for
              the Plan or Plan Template.

              _(Optional)_ If not specified, the Pricing remains active indefinitely.

          minimum_spend: The minimum spend amount per billing cycle for end customer Accounts on a Plan
              to which the Pricing is applied.

          minimum_spend_bill_in_advance: The default value is **FALSE**.

              - When **TRUE**, minimum spend is billed at the start of each billing period.

              - When **FALSE**, minimum spend is billed at the end of each billing period.

              _(Optional)_. Overrides the setting at Organization level for minimum spend
              billing in arrears/in advance.

          minimum_spend_description: Minimum spend description _(displayed on the bill line item)_.

          overage_pricing_bands: Specify Prepayment/Balance overage pricing in pricing bands for the case of a
              **Tiered** pricing structure. The overage pricing rates will be used to charge
              for usage if the Account has a Commitment/Prepayment or Balance applied to it
              and the entire Commitment/Prepayment or Balance amount has been consumed.

              **Constraints:**

              - Can only be used for a **Tiered** pricing structure. If cumulative is
                **FALSE** and you defined `overagePricingBands`, then you'll receive an error.
              - If `tiersSpanPlan` is set to **TRUE** for usage accumulates over entire
                contract period, then cannot be used.
              - If the Commitment/Prepayement or Balance has an `overageSurchargePercent`
                defined, then this will override any `overagePricingBands` you've defined for
                the pricing.

          plan_id: UUID of the Plan the Pricing is created for.

          plan_template_id: UUID of the Plan Template the Pricing is created for.

          segment: Specifies the segment value which you are defining a Pricing for using this
              call:

              - For each segment value defined on a Segmented Aggregation you must create a
                separate Pricing and use the appropriate `aggregationId` parameter for the
                call.
              - If you specify a segment value that has not been defined for the Aggregation,
                you'll receive an error.
              - If you've defined segment values for the Aggregation using a single wildcard
                or multiple wildcards, you can create Pricing for these wildcard segment
                values also.

              For more details on creating Pricings for segment values on a Segmented
              Aggregation using this call, together with some examples, see the
              [Using API Call to Create Segmented Pricings](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/plans-and-pricing/pricing-plans/pricing-plans-using-segmented-aggregations#using-api-call-to-create-a-segmented-pricing)
              in our User Documentation.

          tiers_span_plan: The default value is **FALSE**.

              - If **TRUE**, usage accumulates over the entire period the priced Plan is
                active for the account, and is not reset for pricing band rates at the start
                of each billing period.

              - If **FALSE**, usage does not accumulate, and is reset for pricing bands at the
                start of each billing period.

          type: - **DEBIT**. Default setting. The amount calculated using the Pricing is added
                to the bill as a debit.

              - **PRODUCT_CREDIT**. The amount calculated using the Pricing is added to the
                bill as a credit _(negative amount)_. To prevent negative billing, the bill
                will be capped at the total of other line items for the same Product.

              - **GLOBAL_CREDIT**. The amount calculated using the Pricing is added to the
                bill as a credit _(negative amount)_. To prevent negative billing, the bill
                will be capped at the total of other line items for the entire bill, which
                might include other Products the Account consumes.

          version:
              The version number of the entity:

              - **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - _do not use
                for Create_. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the
                response.
              - **Update Entity:** On Update, version is required and must match the existing
                version because a check is performed to ensure sequential versioning is
                preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.

          cumulative: Controls whether or not charge rates under a set of pricing bands configured for
              a Pricing are applied according to each separate band or at the highest band
              reached.

              _(Optional)_. The default value is **FALSE**.

              - When TRUE, at billing charge rates are applied according to each separate
                band.

              - When FALSE, at billing charge rates are applied according to highest band
                reached.

              **NOTE:** Use the `cumulative` parameter to create the type of Pricing you
              require. For example, for Tiered Pricing set to **TRUE**; for Volume Pricing,
              set to **FALSE**.

          description: Displayed on Bill line items.

          end_date: The end date _(in ISO-8601 format)_ for when the Pricing ceases to be active for

          minimum_spend: The minimum spend amount per billing cycle for end customer Accounts on a Plan
              to which the Pricing is applied.

          minimum_spend_bill_in_advance: The default value is **FALSE**.

              - When **TRUE**, minimum spend is billed at the start of each billing period.

              - When **FALSE**, minimum spend is billed at the end of each billing period.

              _(Optional)_. Overrides the setting at Organization level for minimum spend

          minimum_spend_description: Minimum spend description _(displayed on the bill line item)_.

          overage_pricing_bands: Specify Prepayment/Balance overage pricing in pricing bands for the case of a
              **Tiered** pricing structure. The overage pricing rates will be used to charge
              for usage if the Account has a Commitment/Prepayment or Balance applied to it
              and the entire Commitment/Prepayment or Balance amount has been consumed.

              **Constraints:**

              - Can only be used for a **Tiered** pricing structure. If cumulative is
                **FALSE** and you defined `overagePricingBands`, then you'll receive an error.
              - If `tiersSpanPlan` is set to **TRUE** for usage accumulates over entire
                contract period, then cannot be used.
              - If the Commitment/Prepayement or Balance has an `overageSurchargePercent`
                defined, then this will override any `overagePricingBands` you've defined for

          plan_id: UUID of the Plan the Pricing is created for.

          plan_template_id: UUID of the Plan Template the Pricing is created for.

          segment: Specifies the segment value which you are defining a Pricing for using this
              call:

              - For each segment value defined on a Segmented Aggregation you must create a
                separate Pricing and use the appropriate `aggregationId` parameter for the
                call.

              in our User Documentation.

          tiers_span_plan: The default value is **FALSE**.

              - If **TRUE**, usage accumulates over the entire period the priced Plan is
                active for the account, and is not reset for pricing band rates at the start
                of each billing period.

              - If **FALSE**, usage does not accumulate, and is reset for pricing bands at the
                start of each billing period.

          type: - **DEBIT**. Default setting. The amount calculated using the Pricing is added
                to the bill as a debit.

              - **PRODUCT_CREDIT**. The amount calculated using the Pricing is added to the
                bill as a credit _(negative amount)_. To prevent negative billing, the bill

        **Notes:**

        - Exactly one of `planId` or `planTemplateId` request parameters are required
          for this call to be valid. If you omit both, then you will receive a
          validation error.
        - Exactly one of `aggregationId` or `compoundAggregationId` request parameters
          are required for this call to be valid. If you omit both, then you will
          receive a validation error.

        Args:
          pricing_bands

          start_date: The start date _(in ISO-8601 format)_ for when the Pricing starts to be active
              for the Plan of Plan Template._(Required)_

          accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Pricing should be attributed to for accounting purposes

          aggregation_id: UUID of the Aggregation used to create the Pricing. Use this when creating a
              Pricing for a segmented aggregation.

          code: Unique short code for the Pricing.

          compound_aggregation_id: UUID of the Compound Aggregation used to create the Pricing.

          cumulative: Controls whether or not charge rates under a set of pricing bands configured for
              a Pricing are applied according to each separate band or at the highest band
              reached.

              _(Optional)_. The default value is **FALSE**.

              - When TRUE, at billing charge rates are applied according to each separate
                band.

              - When FALSE, at billing charge rates are applied according to highest band
                reached.

              **NOTE:** Use the `cumulative` parameter to create the type of Pricing you
              require. For example, for Tiered Pricing set to **TRUE**; for Volume Pricing,
              set to **FALSE**.

          description: Displayed on Bill line items.

          end_date: The end date _(in ISO-8601 format)_ for when the Pricing ceases to be active for
              the Plan or Plan Template.

              _(Optional)_ If not specified, the Pricing remains active indefinitely.

          minimum_spend: The minimum spend amount per billing cycle for end customer Accounts on a Plan
              to which the Pricing is applied.

          minimum_spend_bill_in_advance: The default value is **FALSE**.

              - When **TRUE**, minimum spend is billed at the start of each billing period.

              - When **FALSE**, minimum spend is billed at the end of each billing period.

              _(Optional)_. Overrides the setting at Organization level for minimum spend
              billing in arrears/in advance.

          minimum_spend_description: Minimum spend description _(displayed on the bill line item)_.

          overage_pricing_bands: Specify Prepayment/Balance overage pricing in pricing bands for the case of a
              **Tiered** pricing structure. The overage pricing rates will be used to charge
              for usage if the Account has a Commitment/Prepayment or Balance applied to it
              and the entire Commitment/Prepayment or Balance amount has been consumed.

              **Constraints:**

              - Can only be used for a **Tiered** pricing structure. If cumulative is
                **FALSE** and you defined `overagePricingBands`, then you'll receive an error.
              - If `tiersSpanPlan` is set to **TRUE** for usage accumulates over entire
                contract period, then cannot be used.
              - If the Commitment/Prepayement or Balance has an `overageSurchargePercent`
                defined, then this will override any `overagePricingBands` you've defined for
                the pricing.

          plan_id: UUID of the Plan the Pricing is created for.

          plan_template_id: UUID of the Plan Template the Pricing is created for.

          segment: Specifies the segment value which you are defining a Pricing for using this
              call:

              - For each segment value defined on a Segmented Aggregation you must create a
                separate Pricing and use the appropriate `aggregationId` parameter for the
                call.
              - If you specify a segment value that has not been defined for the Aggregation,
                you'll receive an error.
              - If you've defined segment values for the Aggregation using a single wildcard
                or multiple wildcards, you can create Pricing for these wildcard segment
                values also.

              For more details on creating Pricings for segment values on a Segmented
              Aggregation using this call, together with some examples, see the
              [Using API Call to Create Segmented Pricings](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/plans-and-pricing/pricing-plans/pricing-plans-using-segmented-aggregations#using-api-call-to-create-a-segmented-pricing)
              in our User Documentation.

          tiers_span_plan: The default value is **FALSE**.

              - If **TRUE**, usage accumulates over the entire period the priced Plan is
                active for the account, and is not reset for pricing band rates at the start
                of each billing period.

              - If **FALSE**, usage does not accumulate, and is reset for pricing bands at the
                start of each billing period.

          type: - **DEBIT**. Default setting. The amount calculated using the Pricing is added
                to the bill as a debit.

              - **PRODUCT_CREDIT**. The amount calculated using the Pricing is added to the
                bill as a credit _(negative amount)_. To prevent negative billing, the bill
                will be capped at the total of other line items for the same Product.

              - **GLOBAL_CREDIT**. The amount calculated using the Pricing is added to the
                bill as a credit _(negative amount)_. To prevent negative billing, the bill
                will be capped at the total of other line items for the entire bill, which

        **Notes:**

        - Exactly one of `planId` or `planTemplateId` request parameters are required
          for this call to be valid. If you omit both, then you will receive a
          validation error.
        - Exactly one of `aggregationId` or `compoundAggregationId` request parameters
          are required for this call to be valid. If you omit both, then you will
          receive a validation error.

        Args:
          pricing_bands

          start_date: The start date _(in ISO-8601 format)_ for when the Pricing starts to be active
              for the Plan of Plan Template._(Required)_

          accounting_product_id: Optional Product ID this Pricing should be attributed to for accounting purposes

          aggregation_id: UUID of the Aggregation used to create the Pricing. Use this when creating a
              Pricing for a segmented aggregation.

          code: Unique short code for the Pricing.

          compound_aggregation_id: UUID of the Compound Aggregation used to create the Pricing.

          cumulative: Controls whether or not charge rates under a set of pricing bands configured for
              a Pricing are applied according to each separate band or at the highest band
              reached.

              _(Optional)_. The default value is **FALSE**.

              - When TRUE, at billing charge rates are applied according to each separate
                band.

              - When FALSE, at billing charge rates are applied according to highest band
                reached.

              **NOTE:** Use the `cumulative` parameter to create the type of Pricing you
              require. For example, for Tiered Pricing set to **TRUE**; for Volume Pricing,
              set to **FALSE**.

          description: Displayed on Bill line items.

          end_date: The end date _(in ISO-8601 format)_ for when the Pricing ceases to be active for
              the Plan or Plan Template.

              _(Optional)_ If not specified, the Pricing remains active indefinitely.

          minimum_spend: The minimum spend amount per billing cycle for end customer Accounts on a Plan
              to which the Pricing is applied.

          minimum_spend_bill_in_advance: The default value is **FALSE**.

              - When **TRUE**, minimum spend is billed at the start of each billing period.

              - When **FALSE**, minimum spend is billed at the end of each billing period.

              _(Optional)_. Overrides the setting at Organization level for minimum spend
              billing in arrears/in advance.

          minimum_spend_description: Minimum spend description _(displayed on the bill line item)_.

          overage_pricing_bands: Specify Prepayment/Balance overage pricing in pricing bands for the case of a
              **Tiered** pricing structure. The overage pricing rates will be used to charge
              for usage if the Account has a Commitment/Prepayment or Balance applied to it
              and the entire Commitment/Prepayment or Balance amount has been consumed.

              **Constraints:**

              - Can only be used for a **Tiered** pricing structure. If cumulative is
                **FALSE** and you defined `overagePricingBands`, then you'll receive an error.
              - If `tiersSpanPlan` is set to **TRUE** for usage accumulates over entire
                contract period, then cannot be used.
              - If the Commitment/Prepayement or Balance has an `overageSurchargePercent`
                defined, then this will override any `overagePricingBands` you've defined for
                the pricing.

          plan_id: UUID of the Plan the Pricing is created for.

          plan_template_id: UUID of the Plan Template the Pricing is created for.

          segment: Specifies the segment value which you are defining a Pricing for using this
              call:

              - For each segment value defined on a Segmented Aggregation you must create a
                separate Pricing and use the appropriate `aggregationId` parameter for the
                call.
              - If you specify a segment value that has not been defined for the Aggregation,
                you'll receive an error.
              - If you've defined segment values for the Aggregation using a single wildcard
                or multiple wildcards, you can create Pricing for these wildcard segment
                values also.

              For more details on creating Pricings for segment values on a Segmented
              Aggregation using this call, together with some examples, see the
              [Using API Call to Create Segmented Pricings](https://www.m3ter.com/docs/guides/plans-and-pricing/pricing-plans/pricing-plans-using-segmented-aggregations#using-api-call-to-create-a-segmented-pricing)
              in our User Documentation.

          tiers_span_plan: The default value is **FALSE**.

              - If **TRUE**, usage accumulates over the entire period the priced Plan is
                active for the account, and is not reset for pricing band rates at the start
                of each billing period.

              - If **FALSE**, usage does not accumulate, and is reset for pricing bands at the
                start of each billing period.

          type: - **DEBIT**. Default setting. The amount calculated using the Pricing is added
                to the bill as a debit.

              - **PRODUCT_CREDIT**. The amount calculated using the Pricing is added to the
                bill as a credit _(negative amount)_. To prevent negative billing, the bill
                will be capped at the total of other line items for the same Product.

              - **GLOBAL_CREDIT**. The amount calculated using the Pricing is added to the
                bill as a credit _(negative amount)_. To prevent negative billing, the bill
                will be capped at the total of other line items for the entire bill, which
                might include other Products the Account consumes.

          version:
              The version number of the entity:

              - **Create entity:** Not valid for initial insertion of new entity - _do not use
                for Create_. On initial Create, version is set at 1 and listed in the
                response.
              - **Update Entity:** On Update, version is required and must match the existing
                version because a check is performed to ensure sequential versioning is
                preserved. Version is incremented by 1 and listed in the response.
