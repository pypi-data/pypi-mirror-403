    Optional setting to define a _billing cycle date_, which sets the date of the
    first Bill and acts as a reference for when in the applied billing frequency
    period subsequent bills are created:

    - For example, if you attach a Plan to an Account where the Plan is configured
      for monthly billing frequency and you've defined the period the Plan will
      apply to the Account to be from January 1st, 2022 until January 1st, 2023. You
      then set a `billEpoch` date of February 15th, 2022. The first Bill will be
      created for the Account on February 15th, and subsequent Bills created on the
      15th of the months following for the remainder of the billing period - March
      15th, April 15th, and so on.
    - If not defined, then the relevant Epoch date set for the billing frequency
      period at Organization level will be used instead.

    Define the order in which any Prepayment or Balance amounts on the Account are

    - `"PREPAYMENT","BALANCE"`. Draw-down against Prepayment credit before Balance

    - `"BALANCE","PREPAYMENT"`. Draw-down against Balance credit before Prepayment
      credit.
    - `"PREPAYMENT"`. Only draw-down against Prepayment credit.
    - `"BALANCE"`. Only draw-down against Balance credit.

    **NOTES:**

    - Any setting you define here overrides the setting for credit application order
      at Organization level.
    - If the Account belongs to a Parent/Child Account hierarchy, then the
      `creditApplicationOrder` settings are not available, and the draw-down order
      defaults always to Prepayment then Balance order.

    - If you define an Account currency, this will be used for bills.
    - If you do not define a currency, the billing currency defined at
      Organizational level will be used.

    **Note:** If you've attached a Plan to the Account that uses a different
    currency to the billing currency, then you must add the relevant currency
    conversion rate at Organization level to ensure the billing process can convert
    line items calculated using the Plan currency into the selected billing
    currency. If you don't add these conversion rates, then bills will fail for the

    statement definition specified at Organizational level is used.

    Bill statements can be used as informative backing sheets to invoices. Based on
    the usage breakdown defined in the statement definition, generated statements
    give a breakdown of usage charges on Account Bills, which helps customers better
    understand usage charges incurred over the billing period.
