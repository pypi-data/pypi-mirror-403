      value of usage data measurement submissions. If using this method, please

    - **MEAN**. Uses the arithmetic mean of the values. Can be applied to a

    - **UNIQUE**. Uses unique values and returns a count of the number of unique
      values. Can be applied to a **Metadata** `targetField`.

    - **CUSTOM_SQL**. Uses an SQL query expression. The `customSQL` parameter is
      used for the SQL query.
