An open-source Python toolkit for power system automation, providing a high-performance "syntax-sugar" fork of Easy SimAuto (ESA). This library streamlines interaction with PowerWorld's Simulator Automation Server (SimAuto), transforming complex COM calls into intuitive, Pythonic operations.

Key Features
------------

- **Intuitive Indexing Syntax**: Access and modify grid components using a unique indexing system (e.g., ``wb[Bus, "BusPUVolt"]``) that feels like native Python.
- **Comprehensive SimAuto Wrapper**: Full coverage of PowerWorld's API through the ``SAW`` class, organized into modular mixins for power flow, contingencies, transients, and more.
- **High-Level Adapter Interface**: A collection of simplified "one-liner" functions for common tasks like GIC calculation, fault analysis, and voltage violation detection.
- **Native Pandas Integration**: Every data retrieval operation returns a Pandas DataFrame or Series, enabling immediate analysis, filtering, and visualization.
- **Advanced Analysis Apps**: Built-in specialized modules for Network topology analysis, Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GIC), and Forced Oscillation detection.

Installation
------------

The ESA++ package is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/esapp/>`_

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install esapp


Documentation
-------------

For a comprehensive tutorial, usage guides, and the full API reference, please visit our `documentation website <https://esapp.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Usage Example
-------------

Here is a quick example of how ESA++ simplifies data access and power flow analysis.

.. code-block:: python

    from esapp import GridWorkBench
    from esapp.grid import *

    # Open Case
    wb = GridWorkBench("path/to/case.pwb")

    # Retrieve data 
    bus_data = wb[Bus, ["BusName", "BusPUVolt"]]

    # Solve power flow
    V = wb.pflow()

    # Do some action, write to PW
    violations = wb.find_violations(v_min=0.95)
    wb[Gen, "GenMW"] = 100.0

    # Save case
    wb.save()

Why ESA++?
----------

Traditional automation of PowerWorld Simulator often involves verbose COM calls and manual data parsing. ESA++ abstracts these complexities:

*   **Speed**: Optimized data transfer between Python and SimAuto.
*   **Clarity**: Code that reads like the engineering operations it performs.
*   **Ecosystem**: Built on top of the proven ESA library, adding modern Python features and better integration with the SciPy stack.


More Examples
-------------

The `docs/examples/ <https://github.com/lukelowry/ESApp/tree/main/docs/examples>`_ directory contains a gallery of demonstrations, including:

- **Object Field Access**: Reduce the time you spend searching for field names with ESA++ IDE typehints for objects and fields.
- **Matrix Extraction**: Retrieving Y-Bus, Jacobian, and GIC conductance matrices for external mathematical modeling.

Testing
-------

ESA++ includes an extensive test suite covering both offline mocks and live PowerWorld connections. To run the tests, install the test dependencies and execute pytest:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install .[test]
    pytest tests/test_saw.py
