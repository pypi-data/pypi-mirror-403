# cbinterface

`cbinterface` is a command line tool and library for interfacing with one or more Carbon Black environments. 

As of now, `cbinterface` primarily supports Carbon Black Enterprise EDR and Carbon Black Response. However, a lot of functionality should also work with other CBC products, like Enterprise Standard. If you're using Enterprise Standard and something doesn't work, open an issue and I can likely swap out an underlying object and have it working quickly.

# Install & Setup

## Install Via pip

```bash
pip install cbinterface
```

## Install Direct from Github

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ace-ecosystem/cbinterface2
```

## Setup & Configure

[Look here](https://github.com/ace-ecosystem/cbinterface2/wiki/Configuration) for help setting up and configuring `cbinterface`	 to work with your Carbon Black enviroments and according to your preferences.
