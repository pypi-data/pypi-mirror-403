Configuration
=============

Like any Celery application, GWCelery's configuration options are stored at run
time in a global configuration object, :obj:`gwcelery.app.conf`. There are
options for Celery itself such as options that affect the task and result
backends; these options are documented in the :ref:`celery:configuration`
section of the Celery manual.

The configuration object also holds all of the options that are specific to
GWCelery and affect the behavior of individual GWCelery tasks; examples include
the GraceDB service URLs, IGWN Alert groups, GCN hostnames, and frame file types and
channel names. For a list of all GWCelery-specific options, see the
API documentation for the :mod:`gwcelery.conf` module.

GWCelery provides five preset configurations, one for each GraceDB server
instance (production, deployment, testing, minikube or playground). The default
configuration preset is for the playground server,
``gracedb-playground.ligo.org``. The recommended way to select a different
preset is to set the :meth:`CELERY_CONFIG_MODULE
<celery.Celery.config_from_envvar>` environment variable before starting the
workers. For example, to configure GWCelery for production::

    $ export CELERY_CONFIG_MODULE=gwcelery.conf.production

Authentication
--------------

There are a few files that must be present in order to provide authentication
tokens for GraceDB and :doc:`IGWN Alert <igwn-alert:index>`.

.. rubric:: IGWN Alert

You must provide a valid username and password for :doc:`IGWN Alert <igwn-alert:index>`. You can request an
account using the `SCiMMA Auth portal`_. To get started, see :doc:`IGWN Alert Userguide <igwn-alert:guide>`.
The IGWN Alert username and password should be stored in your `auth.toml`_ file.

.. rubric:: Kafka

You must provide a file named ``kafka_credential_map.json`` that maps
deployment specific usernames for Kafka credentials to the logical names given
in the configuration files. This file should be saved in the GWCelery XDG
config directory (``${HOME}/.config/gwcelery/`` by default on many Linux and
UNIX-like operating systems). An example file can be seen below::

    {
        "consumer": {
            "fermi": "user_one",
            "swift": "user_two"
        },
        "producer": {
            "gcn": "user_one",
            "scimma": "user_three"
        }
    }

Note that one user can be specified multiple times. ``hop auth`` must have
information about each user specified in this file. Every Kafka producer and
consumer configuration key must have an entry in this file.

.. rubric:: GraceDB and CVMFS token

You must provide a valid credential for communicating with GracedB and for
reading frames from CVMFS for :mod:`detchar <gwcelery.tasks.detchar>` checks.
You can `obtain a robot keytab`_ for `SciToken`_ authentication with the scopes
``read:/virgo gracedb.read``. The keytab should be stored in the ``${HOME}``
directory, and named ``krb5.keytab``.

For production deployments using HTCondor, you must configure the bearer token
file location. Set the ``BEARER_TOKEN_FILE`` environment variable to specify
the location of the bearer token file. This is typically done in your
``.bashrc`` or deployment configuration::

    export BEARER_TOKEN_FILE=/run/user/$(id -u)/bt_u$(id -u)

This environment variable should be set both in your shell environment and
passed through to HTCondor jobs. GWCelery's HTCondor integration automatically
includes ``BEARER_TOKEN_FILE`` in the list of environment variables passed to
worker processes.

Redis
-----

We recommend that you make the following settings in your Redis server
configuration file (which is located at :file:`/etc/redis.conf` on most
systems)::

    # Some GWCelery tasks transfer large payloads through Redis.
    # The default Redis client bandwidth limits are too small.
    client-output-buffer-limit normal 0 0 0
    client-output-buffer-limit slave 256mb 64mb 60
    client-output-buffer-limit pubsub 256mb 64mb 60

    # If worker nodes are only reachable on a specific network interface,
    # then make sure to bind any additional IP addresses here.
    bind 127.0.0.1 10.0.0.1  # replace 10.0.0.1 with address on cluster network

    # Disable RDB snapshots.
    save ""

    # Enable appendonly snapshots.
    appendonly yes

If you have to make any changes to your Redis configuration, be sure to restart
the Redis daemon.

Cron
----

For deployments of GWCelery at
`LIGO Data Grid computing sites <https://computing.docs.ligo.org/guide/computing-centres/ldg/>`_,
it is recommended that you configure :manpage:`cron <cron(8)>` to call the
script ``cron.sh`` once per hour by adding the following to your
:manpage:`crontab <crontab(1)>`::

    @hourly $HOME/cron.sh

This script automatically renews credentials, rotates log files, and cleans up
old HTCondor log files.
