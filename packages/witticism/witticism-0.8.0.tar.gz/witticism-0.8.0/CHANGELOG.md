## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-23

### 🚀 Feature Release: Transcription Resilience & Compatibility

This release focuses on transcription pipeline reliability, PyTorch compatibility, and improved push-to-talk support for non-keyboard input devices.

### ✨ New Features

#### Push-to-Talk Debounce Support
- **Configurable PTT debounce delay** - Mouse buttons and other input devices that send rapid key events now work reliably as push-to-talk triggers ([#114](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/114), closes [#95](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/issues/95))
- Default 30ms debounce coalesces rapid key up/down events into a single recording session
- Configurable via `hotkeys.ptt_debounce_ms` in configuration file
- Set to 0 to disable debounce for immediate response

### 🔧 Fixed

#### PyTorch 2.6+ Compatibility
- **Fixed startup failures with PyTorch 2.6+** - Added omegaconf types to torch safe globals to support the new `weights_only=True` default in `torch.load()` ([#113](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/113), closes [#105](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/issues/105))
- **Fixed crash on suspend with missing method** - Added `is_loaded()` method to WhisperXEngine to prevent `AttributeError` when system suspend is detected ([#113](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/113), closes [#102](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/issues/102))

#### Transcription Pipeline Resilience
- **Transcription timeout protection** - Wrapped transcription in ThreadPoolExecutor with 60-second timeout to prevent indefinite hangs ([#110](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/110), closes [#106](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/issues/106))
- **Improved no-speech detection** - After 3 consecutive no-speech transcriptions, displays warning notification with troubleshooting suggestions ([#110](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/110), closes [#109](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/issues/109))
- **VAD warning logging** - Captures third-party library warnings from pyannote, whisperx, and faster_whisper for better diagnostics ([#110](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/110), closes [#107](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/issues/107))
- **Audio device name logging** - Logs human-readable device names at startup instead of opaque indices for easier troubleshooting ([#110](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/110), closes [#108](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/issues/108))

## [0.7.2] - 2025-11-20

### 🔧 Fixed

#### Pascal GPU Compatibility (GTX 10-series)
- **Fixed PyTorch 2.8+ incompatibility with Pascal GPUs** - Pinned PyTorch to <2.8.0 to maintain compatibility with GTX 10-series GPUs ([#100](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/100))
- PyTorch 2.8.0+ dropped support for Pascal architecture (compute capability 6.x), affecting GTX 1050/1060/1070/1080/1080 Ti
- Users with these GPUs were experiencing silent fallback to CPU mode with 10x+ performance degradation (14s vs <2s for large model inference)
- Install script now automatically detects Pascal GPUs and pins PyTorch <2.8.0 during installation
- Future GPUs (Volta+, compute capability 7.0+) remain unaffected and can use newer PyTorch versions when ready to upgrade

#### cuDNN Library Loading
- **Fixed cuDNN library loading crashes in pipx environments** - Added preloading of cuDNN libraries to prevent runtime crashes ([#100](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/100))
- PyTorch bundles cuDNN libraries but doesn't add them to dynamic linker search path, causing "Unable to load libcudnn_cnn.so" errors
- Application would crash during transcription when cuDNN libraries couldn't be located
- Solution preloads all cuDNN libraries using ctypes.CDLL with RTLD_GLOBAL before PyTorch imports them
- Particularly critical for pipx installations where libraries are in isolated virtual environments

### 📊 Impact
This patch release addresses critical GPU compatibility issues that prevented Pascal GPU users from benefiting from GPU acceleration. Key fixes include:
- Restored GPU acceleration for all GTX 10-series users (previously falling back to CPU)
- Eliminated transcription crashes caused by missing cuDNN libraries in pipx environments
- Automatic detection and configuration during installation ensures users get optimal performance
- 10x+ performance improvement for affected users by maintaining GPU acceleration

- Torchaudio 2.9.0+ removed the `AudioMetaData` attribute that WhisperX depends on, causing model loading to fail
- Users upgrading to latest PyTorch packages would experience zero text output despite microphone input being detected
- References upstream WhisperX issue: https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX/issues/1270

#### Logging System
- **Fixed logging path expansion** - Logging now works correctly with tilde (~) paths in configuration ([#98](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/98))
- **Enabled default file logging** - Changed default log file from `None` to platformdirs-based path (`~/.local/share/witticism/debug.log`)
- Debug logs are now written by default, making troubleshooting significantly easier
- Path expansion uses `.expanduser()` to properly handle Unix home directory shortcuts

#### Error Handling & Diagnostics
- **Fixed silent model loading failures** - Thread exceptions during model loading are now properly propagated to caller ([#98](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/98))
- Application now fails fast with clear error messages instead of appearing to start successfully when models fail to load
- Added `loading_error` instance variable to track failures from daemon threads
- Prevents confusing situations where app appears to work but produces no transcription output

#### User Interface
- **Fixed duplicate system tray icons** - Resolved issue where CUDA fallback retry created second tray icon ([#98](https://github.com/Aaronontheweb/witticism/pull/98))
- System tray instance is now reused when CUDA initialization requires CPU fallback
- Users with older GPUs or CUDA compatibility issues no longer see duplicate tray icons

### 📊 Impact
This patch release addresses critical bugs discovered during user troubleshooting that prevented the application from functioning correctly. Key fixes include:
- Text output now works reliably with latest PyTorch/torchaudio versions
- Debugging is significantly easier with working default logging
- Clear error messages replace silent failures during model loading
- Cleaner UI experience for users requiring CUDA fallback to CPU mode
