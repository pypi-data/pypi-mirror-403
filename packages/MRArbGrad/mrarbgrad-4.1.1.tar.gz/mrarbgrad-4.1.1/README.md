# Magnetic Resonance Arbitrary Gradient Toolbox (MRArbGrad, MAG)

## Introduction
This toolbox is a pip package with C++ backend. The pip package can be called via Python interface to generate **non-Cartesian** gradient waveforms for built-in and external trajectories. The C++ source code (in `mrarbgrad_src/ext/`) can be ported to other pulse sequence project like UIH's Adept project for gradient waveform calculation.

## Install
**Optionally**, to create a new conda environment (in case the dependencies in this package break your current environment), please run:
```bash
$ conda create -n magtest -y
$ conda activate magtest
$ conda install python==3.12 -y
```

This package is **NOT** restricted to use `Python 3.12`. Feel free to adjust at your convenience, just if the package works.

To install this package from PyPI:
```bash
$ pip install mrarbgrad
```
To install this package from a local repository:
```bash
$ bash install.bash
```

You can also install via `pip install .` but remember to delete `*.egg-info` or pip will run into bug when uninstalling this package in current folder (see comments in `install.bash`).

## Examples & Usages
Examples for generating gradient waveforms for either built-in trajectory (trajectory library) or external trajectory (expressed by trajectory function or trajectory samples) can be found in the `example` folder.
