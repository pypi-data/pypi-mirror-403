    """
    You are generating a theme description for interactive data visualization widgets. These widgets appear in computational notebooks, dashboards, and documents.

    Given the user's request, write a detailed theme description that another AI can use to style widgets consistently. Your output should be a rich, specific prompt -- not code or JSON, but precise natural language that leaves no ambiguity about the visual intent.

    Cover each of these dimensions. High contrast is required for all themes; ensure text and data marks meet WCAG AA contrast against their backgrounds.

    ## Environment & Ground

    Describe the backdrop. Is this a dark interface or light? Warm or cool? What's the overall feeling -- technical, editorial, playful, corporate, minimal? Describe the background color in evocative but specific terms (not just "dark" but "deep charcoal with a subtle blue undertone" or "warm off-white like aged paper").

    Describe secondary surfaces -- cards, containers, nested elements. How do they differentiate from the ground?

    ## Typography

    Describe the typographic personality. Is it sharp and technical? Warm and humanist? Classic and editorial?

    Specify a Google Font (or web-safe fallback) for body text and one for monospace/data. Describe the weight, the size feeling (compact? airy?), the overall texture of text on the page.

    ## Color System

    ### Accent & Interactive
    Describe the primary accent color -- what draws the eye, what signals interactivity. Be specific: not "blue" but "a saturated cobalt" or "muted teal that recedes slightly."

    ### Semantic Colors
    Describe how success, warning, error, and info states should feel. Do they pop aggressively or integrate subtly? What hues?

    ### Data Encoding
    This is critical. Describe:
    - **Categorical palette**: For unordered categories. How many colors? What's the hue range? Are they saturated or muted? Do they feel playful or serious? Should they be colorblind-safe?
    - **Sequential palette**: For ordered continuous data. What hue? How does it progress from low to high -- light to dark? Muted to saturated?
    - **Diverging palette**: For data with a meaningful center. What two hues diverge from the neutral middle?

    ## Chart Elements

    Describe axes and grids. Are axes prominent or receding? What color, what weight? Are there gridlines? If so, are they subtle dotted lines or more structural? Should the chart frame assert itself or disappear?

    ## Interaction Feel

    Describe how interactions should feel. Snappy and immediate? Smooth and relaxed? What happens on hover -- opacity shift? Subtle scale? Color change? How visible should focus rings be for keyboard navigation?

    ## Component Styling

    Describe tooltips: their background, their contrast with content, their border treatment, whether they feel like floating cards or integrated callouts.

    Describe default mark opacity for data points -- should overlapping points build up to show density, or should each point be fully opaque?

    ---

    Write the theme as a cohesive description, not a bulleted checklist. It should read like a design specification that captures both the concrete details and the overall gestalt. Someone reading it should be able to visualize the theme and apply it consistently. High contrast is mandatory.

    Begin with a one-sentence summary that captures the theme's essence, then elaborate on each dimension.

            The primary background is a soft bone or parchment (#f7f0e6). Secondary surfaces lift with off-white panels and subtle hard shadows,
            creating a physical, screen-printed feel. Borders are visible and intentional, often 2px in deep slate.

            Headlines are expressive and geometric (a display serif or bold grotesk), while labels, axes, and data annotations use a precise monospace.

            ## Chart Elements
            Axes and ticks are crisp and dark; gridlines are thin, soft slate with occasional dotted lines for texture.
            Marks are slightly chunky with confident strokes. Corners can be gently rounded to match the tactile UI.

            ## Component Styling
            Tooltips and legends look like small cards: bone background, slate border, hard drop shadow, and monospace details.

            The backdrop is the signature soft pink, creating a warm, paper-like reading environment.
            Secondary surfaces (tooltips, cards) use a deep slate or 'oxford blue' to create sharp, authoritative contrast.

            ## Typography
            The typographic personality is traditional yet urgent. Use a crisp, high-contrast Serif like 'Merriweather' or 'Playfair Display'
            for titles to evoke the 'Financier' typeface. For data labels and axes, switch to a clean, geometric Sans-Serif like 'Inter'
            to ensure legibility at small sizes.

            ## Color System
            - **Accent**: A sharp cyan or claret red used sparingly to highlight current values.
            - **Data Encoding**: Use a categorical palette that contrasts well with pink: slate blue, deep teal, and muted terracotta.
              Avoid yellows that get lost on the background.
            - **Semantic**: Positive/Negative values often use a specific 'financial' green and red, slightly desaturated to match the paper tone.

            ## Chart Elements
            Gridlines are horizontal only, thin, and styled in a dotted 'slate-400' tone. The chart frame is invisible;
            the data sits directly on the page. Axes are minimal.

            ## Typography
            Type is classic and authoritative. Use 'Franklin Gothic' or 'Libre Franklin' for headers--strong, condensed, and assertive.
            Body and data text should be a highly readable serif like 'Georgia' or 'Noto Serif' for that 'newspaper of record' feel.

            - **Data Encoding**: A distinctive, high-contrast categorical palette utilizing 'Upshot Red' (#aa1228), deep blues, and neutral grays.
            - **Sequential**: Monochromatic scales often use shades of purple or blue.
            - **Accent**: Black is used heavily for emphasis.

            ## Chart Elements
            Extremely thin, precise lines. Axis ticks are often removed in favor of direct labeling on the data points.
            Gridlines are extremely faint gray or removed entirely. The distinctive 'NYT pointer' style for annotations is essential.

            The personality is witty and concise. Use 'Officina Sans' or a close alternative like 'Fira Sans' or 'Roboto Slab'.
            Text is often slightly condensed to fit more data into small columns.

            ## Color System
            - **Accent**: The signature 'Economist Red' (#E3120B) is the primary interactive color.
            - **Data Encoding**: A recognizable palette of cyan, dark blue, and muted brown.
            - **Sequential**: Distinctive 'blue-to-red' diverging scales for political or economic sentiment.

            ## Chart Elements
            The defining feature is the 'Red Rectangle' signature often found in the top-left or accompanying the title.
            Charts often place the y-axis grid lines *on top* of the bars/area fills to aid precision reading.

            A very light cool gray or pure white background. It feels airy and open.

            ## Typography
            Headline typography is the star. Use 'Garnett' or a similar distinct, slightly quirky sans-serif (like 'Work Sans' or 'Libre Franklin')
            in a bold weight. It should feel opinionated and contemporary.

            ## Color System
            - **Data Encoding**: A vibrant, almost primary palette: Guardian Red, Egyptian Blue, and a sunny Yellow.
              These colors are saturated and pop against the white ground.
            - **Semantic**: Success/Fail states use these same saturated brand colors rather than standard green/red.

            Circular elements (bubbles, dots) are common. Lines are thick and confident.
            Layouts often use asymmetric balance.

            Neo-grotesque and Swiss. Use 'Inter' or 'Helvetica Now'. Titles are bold, black, and tightly kerned.
