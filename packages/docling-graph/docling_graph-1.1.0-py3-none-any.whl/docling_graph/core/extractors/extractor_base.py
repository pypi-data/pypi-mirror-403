        Extracts structured data from a source document based on a Pydantic template.

        Args:
            source (str): The file path to the document.
            template (Type[BaseModel]): The Pydantic model to extract into.

        Returns:
            Tuple[List[BaseModel], Optional[DoclingDocument]]: A tuple containing:
                - List of Pydantic model instances:
                    - For "One-to-One": Contains N models (one per page).
                    - For "Many-to-One":
                        * Success: Contains 1 consolidated model
                        * Partial failure: May contain multiple models (batch/page results)
                          when merge/consolidation fails (zero data loss strategy)
                        * Complete failure: Empty list
                - The DoclingDocument object used during extraction (or None if extraction failed).

        Note:
            The Many-to-One strategy implements a zero data loss policy. When consolidation
            or merging fails, it returns all successfully extracted partial models rather
            than discarding data. Consumers should handle cases where len(models) > 1 for
            Many-to-One extractions by either:
                1. Using the first model as the primary result
                2. Implementing custom merge logic
                3. Processing all partial models independently
