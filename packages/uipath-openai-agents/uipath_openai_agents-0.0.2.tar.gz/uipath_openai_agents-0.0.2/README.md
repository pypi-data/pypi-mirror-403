A Python SDK that enables developers to build and deploy OpenAI Agents to the UiPath Cloud Platform. It provides programmatic interaction with UiPath Cloud Platform services.

This package is an extension to the [UiPath Python SDK](https://github.com/UiPath/uipath-python) and implements the [UiPath Runtime Protocol](https://github.com/UiPath/uipath-runtime-python).

Check out these [sample projects](https://github.com/UiPath/uipath-integrations-python/tree/main/packages/uipath-openai-agents/samples) to see the SDK in action.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.11 or higher
-   UiPath Automation Cloud account

## Installation

```bash
pip install uipath-openai-agents
```

using `uv`:

```bash
uv add uipath-openai-agents
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```
UIPATH_URL=https://cloud.uipath.com/ACCOUNT_NAME/TENANT_NAME
UIPATH_ACCESS_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The SDK provides a command-line interface for creating, packaging, and deploying OpenAI Agents:

### Authentication

```bash
uipath auth
```

This command opens a browser for authentication and creates/updates your `.env` file with the proper credentials.

### Initialize a Project

```bash
uipath init
```

Running `uipath init` will process the agent definitions in the `openai_agents.json` file and create the corresponding `entry-points.json` file needed for deployment.

For more details on the configuration format, see the [UiPath configuration specifications](https://github.com/UiPath/uipath-python/blob/main/specs/README.md).

### Debug a Project

```bash
uipath run AGENT [INPUT]
```

Executes the agent with the provided JSON input arguments.

### Package a Project

```bash
uipath pack
```

Packages your project into a `.nupkg` file that can be deployed to UiPath.

**Note:** Your `pyproject.toml` must include:

-   A description field (avoid characters: &, <, >, ", ', ;)
-   Author information

Example:

```toml
description = "Your package description"
authors = [{name = "Your Name", email = "your.email@example.com"}]
```

### Publish a Package

```bash
uipath publish
```

Publishes the most recently created package to your UiPath Orchestrator.

## Project Structure

To properly use the CLI for packaging and publishing, your project should include:

-   A `pyproject.toml` file with project metadata
-   A `openai_agents.json` file with your agent definitions (e.g., `"agents": {"agent": "main.py:agent"}`)
-   A `entry-points.json` file (generated by `uipath init`)
-   A `bindings.json` file (generated by `uipath init`) to configure resource overrides
-   Any Python files needed for your automation

## Development

### Developer Tools

Check out [uipath-dev](https://github.com/uipath/uipath-dev-python) - an interactive terminal application for building, testing, and debugging UiPath Python runtimes, agents, and automation scripts.
