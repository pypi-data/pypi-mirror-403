"""Ensemble Refinement - multiple agents implement, see each other's work, refine iterativly with a judge.

Pattern:
  Round 1: Each agent writes independent implementation to file
  Round 2+: Each agent reads others' files, writes improved version
  Final: Judge picks winner → winner writes final.py

Workspace structure:
  ensemble-{timestamp}/
  ├── coder0/
  │   ├── round1.py
  │   ├── round2.py
  │   └── final.py  (if winner)

  └── coder2/
      ├── round1.py
      └── round2.py

This produces better code than a single agent because:
  - Multiple approaches explored in parallel
  - Agents learn from each other's edge cases, optimizations, patterns
  - Competition/collaboration drives quality up
  - Winner incorporates best ideas from all agents in final pass
  - Real files you can run, test, diff

Usage:
  hcom run ensemble "implement binary search"
  hcom run ensemble "write a rate limiter class" --rounds 3
  hcom run ensemble "implement LRU cache" --agents 4 --rounds 2

WORKSPACE: {workspace}
YOUR FOLDER: {my_folder}

RULES:
1. Write complete, working implementations (not pseudocode)
2. Include type hints and docstrings
3. Write your code to FILES, then notify via hcom with the file path
4. When you see others' code in later rounds, READ their files and learn from their approaches
5. In refinement rounds, you may:
   - Adopt better patterns you see
   - Fix bugs you notice in your approach
   - Combine ideas from multiple implementations
   - Keep your approach if you think it's best, but explain why

FILE STRUCTURE:
- Round 1: Write to {my_folder}/round1.py
- Round 2: Write to {my_folder}/round2.py
- etc.
- If you win: Write to {my_folder}/final.py

TO READ OTHERS' CODE:
- Read files like: {workspace}/coder0/round1.py, {workspace}/coder1/round1.py, etc.

IF YOU WIN:
The judge will announce you as the winner and ask you to write the FINAL implementation.
This is your chance to write the definitive version:
- Incorporate the best ideas the judge highlighted from other agents
- Keep what made your approach win
- Write to {my_folder}/final.py

COMMUNICATION:
After writing your file, notify everyone:
hcom send "@judge- [other coders] ROUND N done: {my_folder}/roundN.py" --thread {{thread}}

Keep messages short - the code is in the file."""

Your job:

2. Code Quality (25%) - Readable, maintainable, idiomatic?
3. Performance (20%) - Time/space complexity, efficiency?
4. Robustness (15%) - Error handling, defensive coding?

Each agent has a distinct coding style (simple, optimized, defensive, pythonic, tested).
They work in rounds: implement independently → see each other's code → refine.
A judge picks the winner who writes the final implementation.

WHAT HAPPENS:
  1. Creates workspace: ensemble-{timestamp}/ with subfolders per agent
  2. Round 1: Each agent writes independent implementation to coder{N}/round1.py
  3. Round 2+: Agents read each other's files, write improved versions
  4. Judge evaluates: correctness (40%), quality (25%), performance (20%), robustness (15%)
  5. Winner writes coder{N}/final.py incorporating best ideas from all

USE WHEN:

  - Need high-quality implementation through competition
  - Exploring different tradeoffs (speed vs readability vs robustness)
  - Generating code that benefits from cross-pollination of ideas
