"""Runtime utilities for environment building and TCP notifications.

This module provides shared infrastructure used by both hooks and CLI commands:

Environment Building
--------------------
build_claude_env() loads config.env as environment variable defaults that get
layered under shell environment (shell vars take precedence). This enables
configuration via both file and environment.

TCP Notifications
-----------------
notify_instance() and notify_all_instances() implement the instant message wake
system. When a message is sent, the sender pings all listening instances via TCP
so they don't have to wait for their polling interval.

Architecture:
1. Listeners register ports in the notify_endpoints table
2. Senders call notify_*() after logging messages
3. TCP ping wakes blocked listeners instantly
4. Polling provides fallback if TCP fails

NOTE: bootstrap/launch context text is re-exported from bootstrap.py for
backward compatibility. That content is injected into Claude's (any agent - claude specific info here is not helpful) context via
hooks - the human user never sees it directly.
