""" ResNet models implementation.

This module provides wrapper classes for the ResNet family of models from the Keras applications.
It includes both ResNetV2 models with pre-activation residual blocks and ResNetRS
(ResNet with Revisited Scaling) models that offer improved performance
through various scaling techniques.

Available models:

- ResNetV2 family: Improved ResNet architectures with pre-activation blocks
    - ResNet50V2
    - ResNet101V2
    - ResNet152V2

All models support transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained weights.
