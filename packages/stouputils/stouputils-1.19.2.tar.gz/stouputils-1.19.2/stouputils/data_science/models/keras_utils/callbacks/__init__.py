""" Custom callbacks for Keras models.

Features:

- Learning rate finder callback for finding the optimal learning rate
- Warmup scheduler callback for warmup training
- Progressive unfreezing callback for unfreezing layers during training (incompatible with model.fit(), need a custom training loop)
- Tqdm progress bar callback for better training visualization
- Model checkpoint callback that only starts checkpointing after a given number of epochs
