    This implementation supports optional Fifo ordering via a small ticket queue

        timeout            (float | None):  Seconds to wait for the lock. ``None`` means block indefinitely.
        blocking           (bool):          Whether to block until acquired (subject to ``timeout``).
        check_interval     (float):         Interval between lock attempts, in seconds.
        fifo               (bool):          Whether to enforce Fifo ordering (default: True).
