class RLockFifo(LockFifo):
    """ A re-entrant cross-process lock backed by a file.

    This lock is re-entrant for the same owner, where owner identity is the
    tuple ``(path, pid, thread_id)``. Repeated calls to :meth:`acquire` by the
    same owner increment an internal counter; only the final :meth:`release`
    will release the underlying file lock managed by :class:`LockFifo`.

    Key behaviour:
      - Owner identity: (path, pid, thread_id)
      - Reentrancy applies only within the same thread of the same process.
        Other threads or processes will block (or raise ``LockTimeoutError``)
        according to the lock's timeout and blocking parameters.
      - Implemented on top of :class:`LockFifo` and shares its constructor
        parameters and error semantics.

    Args:
        name               (str):           Lock filename or path. If a simple name is given,
            it is created in the system temporary directory.
        timeout            (float | None):  Seconds to wait for the lock. ``None`` means block indefinitely.
        blocking           (bool):          Whether to block until acquired (subject to ``timeout``).
        check_interval     (float):         Interval between lock attempts, in seconds.
        fifo               (bool):          Whether to enforce Fifo ordering (default: True).
        fifo_stale_timeout (float | None):  Seconds after which a ticket is considered stale; if ``None`` the lock's ``timeout`` value will be used.

    Raises:
        LockTimeoutError: If the lock could not be acquired within the timeout (LockError & TimeoutError subclass)
        LockError: On unexpected locking errors. (RunTimeError subclass)

    Examples:
        >>> with RLockFifo("my.lock", timeout=5):
        ...     # critical section
        ...     pass

        >>> lock = RLockFifo("my.lock")
        >>> lock.acquire()
        >>> lock.acquire()  # re-entrant acquire by same thread/process
        >>> lock.release()
        >>> lock.release()  # underlying lock released here

        >>> # Reentrancy with Fifo enabled should not create multiple tickets
        >>> lock = RLockFifo("my_r.lock", fifo=True, timeout=1)
        >>> lock.acquire()
        >>> lock.acquire()
        >>> lock.release()
        >>> lock.release()

        >>> # Cleanup behaviour: after closing a re-entrant lock the queue should be removed when empty
        >>> import tempfile, os
        >>> tmp = tempfile.mkdtemp()
        >>> p = tmp + "/rlock"
        >>> r = RLockFifo(p, fifo=True, timeout=1)
        >>> r.acquire(); r.acquire(); r.release(); r.release(); r.close()
        >>> os.path.exists(p + ".queue")
        False
