""" VGG models implementation.

This module provides wrapper classes for the VGG family of models from the Keras applications.
VGG models are characterized by their simplicity, using only 3x3 convolutional layers
stacked on top of each other with increasing depth.

Available models:
- VGG16: 16-layer model with 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers
- VGG19: 19-layer model with 16 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers

Both models support transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained weights.
