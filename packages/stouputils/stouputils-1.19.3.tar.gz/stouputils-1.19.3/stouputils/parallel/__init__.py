"""
This module provides utility functions for parallel processing, such as:

- multiprocessing(): Execute a function in parallel using multiprocessing
- multithreading(): Execute a function in parallel using multithreading
- run_in_subprocess(): Execute a function in a subprocess with args and kwargs

I highly encourage you to read the function docstrings to understand when to use each method.

Priority (nice) mapping for multiprocessing():

- Unix-style values from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority)
- Windows automatic mapping:
  * -20 to -10: HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS
  * -9 to -1: ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS
  * 0: NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS
  * 1 to 9: BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS
  * 10 to 19: IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS
