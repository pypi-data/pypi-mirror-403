- MRN: Movement Reference Number (MRN) is a unique identifier assigned to each customs declaration for goods being imported or exported within the European Union (EU).

    - containerNumber: Container Number consists of 4 capital letters followed by 7 digits (e.g., TEMU7972458, CAIU 7222892). It can be identified as container number, cntr. nos., containernummern, cont. nr.
    - goodsDescription: Extract only the description of the goods for the "goodsDescription" but not other information like packing, marks, etc.
    - packagingNumber:
        - Prioritize the "Pallets/PLTS/Cartons/CTNS/Package" over "PCS" count to extract the data for the "packagingNumber".
