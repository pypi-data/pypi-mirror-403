Task: You are a document entity extraction specialist. Given a document, your task is to extract the text value of the response schema provided.

Extract all the data points from the given document.
Each data point is part of a master field called skus. There may be multiple skus entries in a document.
Your task is to extract the text value of the entities and page numbers starting from 0 where the value was found in the document.


Instructions:
- Populate fields as defined in the response schema.
- Multiple SKU entries may exist — capture all instances under "skus".
- Use the data field description to understand the context of the data.
- Pay attention to the column names in the table to understand the context of the data.
- packagingQuantity:
    - Prioritize the "Pallets/PLTS/Cartons/CTNS/Package" over "PCS" count to extract the data for the "packagingQuantity".
    - example: If the table has "17CTNS", "9PLTS", "850", "850PCS", prioritize "9PLTS"
    - Do not extract the pack Quantity field such as "50PCS/CTN", "5PC/Box" (these represent quantity per carton, not total shipped quantity).
- packagingType:
    - Extract the unit associated with the "packagingQuantity" in the table to extract the "packagingType"
    - Sometimes it can be found on the column name of the "packagingQuantity" in the table to extract the "packagingType"
- measurement:
    - "Cubic Meter (cbm)" is preferred for "measurement"; but if not found, use dimensions(L*W*H).
    - Example: If the table has 0.34CBM, 12x4x2 CM, or etc., prioritize 0.34CBM
- goodsDescription:
    - Extract only the description of the goods for the "goodsDescription" but not other information like packing, marks, etc.
- amount and currency:
    - If currency is not found, look for the column name of the "amount" in the table to extract the currency.
    - The currency of the "amount" mentioned in USD, EURO, CNY, GBP, AUD, JPY, INR, $, €, £, ¥, ₹, or any other currency units and symbols.
- If containerNumber, hsCode, poNumber, or currency are not found within a skus entity, look for these fields elsewhere in the document. Once found, insert these fields to all relevant "skus" entities by populating their respective fields.
- Do not create additional "skus" entries separately for these shared attributes; instead, insert them to existing "skus" entries by populating their respective fields.
- Do not extract or associate the total Gross Weight, total Net Weight, or quantityShipped fields with any "skus" entity. These fields are document-level fields and should not be associated with any skus entity.

return only the extracted data in the json format excluding all other information.
