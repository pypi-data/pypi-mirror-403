# canvas-download
canvas-download downloads Canvas modules/files into a local directory for offline access. A file called 'login.json' under the '.config' directory will be created during the first run of the utility, which will require you to fill out the details of your Canvas login credentials. In the second run of the application, '.config/courses.json' will be created by the application and allows you to choose whether to download "files" or "modules" for each course. After those details are filled out, you can simply call 'canvas-download' in the terminal to start the process of downloading files from Canvas.

# How to install
