part of the camp so we are a little bit biased admittedly um because Nathan more so than I but we do know at least one of
25:10
the people affected personally so um it is what it is but Nathan knows more about it so why don't you explain the
25:17
Bion T Christy Hawkins Christy Hawkins powerlifting drama to so I'm GNA I'm GNA
25:24
cover this pretty I'm going to try and just hit the high points so there was a
25:29
post made I believe it was the ABS strength meet or or or whatever it was
25:35
it's going to be in Ireland and they featured briani Terry and Denise Herber
25:41
as going head-to-head Undisputed women's uh 165
25:46
class so when that came out Christy Hawkins posted on it talking about how
25:53
how is it Undisputed when I've beaten both of them which happened earlier this year at the American Pro um admittedly
26:01
and every literally everyone in the comments especially the the higher like level
26:07
lifters you know admittedly Christy Hawkins is the best pound for pound-for-pound lifter in the world
26:13
period man woman child doesn't matter Hawkins is the best by dots she has the best DOT score um but she came in there
26:22
and she said you know why wasn't I involved in this because I'd beat them
26:28
both right why wasn't my name in there well first of all she didn't enter into
26:34
this competition or at least has not so far registered and she also has not registered in a competition outside of
26:39
the United States since 2014 is what people were saying so there's already kind of this like
26:47
self-esteem like why are you bred ego because of an
26:52
advertisement right right right and it's an advertisement for a meat that you're not competing in so first of all that's
26:57
my that's my big thing why why did you even make the comment why why is your ego so fragile that you can't like
27:06
there's and there's nothing wrong with being competitive and being like if you were going to that meet and being like Oh I'm going to win so why are you you
27:12
know like why are they on the flyer right but you're not competing they're competing head-to head at this meet they
27:18
have already registered they are flying out there like so anyway uh briani
27:25
basically says everything that I just said in a in a reply um like you know we
27:31
all know you're the best female or powerlifter regardless best DOT score in
27:36
the world we already know this and the reason why they featured me is because
27:41
I'm in it and you're not um so this is where this is where kind of they started
27:46
Brewing the the drama here she said um if you want to be involved in it Go send
27:53
an email to them I'm sure they'd be happy to have you and you're really good at sending emails well that was a slight
28:00
because as Joe pointed out in the following comment she was the one who sent the email inquiring or rather um
28:10
well we for for the sake of not having read the email we'll say inquiring
28:15
about Brian's weigh in at the American Pro because she did it at a later time
28:21
um which was explained by everyone the rule book says you can if the meet dor
28:27
chooses to weigh in at a scheduled time as opposed to the time where
28:33
collectively everyone weighs in as long as it's the day before as long as as long is the day before and the uh but we
28:40
look at this if it says very clearly in the rule book do meet director's discretion but you can schedule your own
28:46
way in as long as the meet director signs off of it and as long as it's the day
28:52
before you compete the rule book says that in the wrpf and tamie if you're
28:57
still listening um by all means if we're wrong you're you're a judge correct us
29:02
on that but from what me and Nathan read at least until it was it may be different now that they edited it recently because the rules just changed
29:08
I did not see but I'm not sure but it was very clear that it's the meet
29:13
director's discretion like they can schedule you a private weighin uh as long as it's the day before the meet
29:19
that was the rule going into the American Pro yeah so just to be clear about that go ahead I'm
29:25
sorry uh that's fine uh kind of kind of lost where I was at with it but we were
29:30
talking about her having been the one that sent the email right Joe Joe replied and and um said that she was the
29:37
one who had sent the email accusing her of cheating so at this point and I'm not I haven't read the
29:44
email so I'm not going to say she was accusing bani of cheating but that's how it was interpreted a lot of intention is
29:52
interpretation right so that's the way they interpreted Christy Hawkins had every
29:57
every way of sending a personal DM not publicly commenting just sending a
30:03
personal D DM and saying hey I wasn't actually like accusing you of cheating
30:08
but I genuinely didn't see you there you know trying to do something instead she replied and you know basically said I'm
30:16
allowed to do this if I want to you can't stop me from doing this it you know basically justifying her actions in
30:24
regards to this then also making a pretty a comment that made a lot of people
30:31
upset in that she said we are all
30:37
acting like we are in the Special Olympics or commenting on this post is
30:43
like being in the Special Olympics and we're all [ __ ] o that that made a
30:48
lot of people mad myself included like that like I I know I have a Special
30:54
Olympics athlete by the way that's [ __ ] Co no because like and someone
31:00
plenty of comments were going on and a lot of people said you can't say that how dare you say that there that is
31:06
taking every bit of respect for special athletes out of like it's just it's just
31:12
hurting people right and it's not a good look for Power it's not a good look for Power especially someone who's at the
31:18
top of powerlifting the very top almost Untouchable at the top and it's just like why would you say that why would
31:24
you why would you go out of your way like I know a lot of people make
31:30
mistakes say things they don't mean especially In the Heat of the Moment this woman is is 45 if I'm not mistaken
31:38
she's old enough to know better well yeah me I think my my whole my whole thing from the beginning is again I said
31:45
this as a disclaimer before we start this conversation there's x amount of things and Tammy did confirm she she said she
31:52
wasn't sure if it's in the 2020 fourward revisions or not but she did confirm that that was the rule at the time going into the American Pro but I said this in
32:00
the beginning it is your due diligence as a lifter as a coach to know the rule
32:06
book MH those are things that affect us all MH if you're coaching or if you're lifting that is going to have a direct
32:13
effect on you what she should have done is read the rule book before she ever sent an email yeah that way she didn't
32:20
have egg on her face at all if she still felt some kind of way about it the email that should have got sent first
32:26
was clar should have been about a clarification of the rules for her and then if that still wasn't clear maybe
32:33
then proceed with whatever I wouldn't say an accusation but whatever you know
32:38
complaint she had right about the way those weigh-ins worked yeah right that's my biggest grip like you
32:45
have an opportunity to go about this accomplish what you need to accomplish but also do it in a way that it's
32:50
correct you know what I mean and I think that that uh I think that chats my ass about it more than anything to be honest
32:56
with you um I just personally think that we're
33:03
responsible for that side of that side of things like if you're up in arms about something you you definitely have
33:09
she's right you definitely have an you know an opinion that you can voice but at the same time make
33:16
sure that you know what the hell you're talking about before you go and like pull this over on somebody cuz I mean
33:23
all of this stuff one could have been avoided and two it's kind of embarrassing on every body's front even a little bit as much as I love them
33:31
like Joe kind of has a way of throwing some gas on the fire from time to time he does he does and I think you know
33:36
he's one of the greatest men in the sport I think he does more good for uh the sport than almost anybody on the planet but like at the same time you
33:43
kind of got to like I don't know maybe dial it back a little bit to you know prevent it
33:50
exploding right um I know you're looking up that that thread right now so I'll let you speak more on it but I guess my
33:56
grp is d diligence should have been practiced and you should have known the rule book before you made these
34:01
accusations right and really that's that's kind of like the long and short of it there's a lot of back and forth um
34:08
Joe talking with other commenters about the situation um nothing nothing really in
34:17
relation to the Christy Hawkins issue at that point it's more just another just like patently ridiculous thing about all
34:24
this is this girl has not register to compete in this meat that's in Ireland
34:29
and I understand that's an incredibly incredibly expensive trip for an American uh not just the flight but you
34:36
got to stay there you're going to deal with probably x amount of jet lag although I think Ireland's only like a six to eight hour flight it's not
34:42
probably depending on what part of the United States you're flying from uh but it's you know really pretty quick flight
34:47
but you're going to end end up with x amount of jet lag so there's a physical price you have to pay for it it's
34:54
expensive yep you got to pay for the meat you got got to pay for room and board and everything else she has an
35:00
opportunity to compete in this thing but she chooses not to and she and and she hasn't so I mean like but something we
35:06
talk about this good for powerlifting all the time is we want it to be more of a spectator sport M I think it's a good
35:12
spectator sport um I think it's a sport worth watching if you're whoever these
35:17
organizers are it's an ABS meet right y if you're whoever these organizers
35:22
are you're probably going to use the best lifters you have Reg registered mhm
35:28
as advertisement yeah because we are trying to improve it as a spectator sport we're trying to make it worthwhile
35:33
for people to tune in and watch uh we think it's a real and viable Sport and the whole powerlifting world thinks it's
35:40
a good thing to have more fans more people tuning in more watching it so why wouldn't you
35:45
advertise Herbert and Terry who are who are at the top yeah sure chrisy Hawkins
35:51
isn't on the fly but she didn't register you can't advertise somebody that didn't register for your [ __ ] meet like it
35:58
makes sense to advertise Terry and Herber yep that's it I mean that's you
36:03
know we want powerlifting to be bigger like it's no different than you know
36:08
seeing an ad for the NFC Championship or the AFC Championship today like those are the teams that made it yep if you're
36:15
not there blame yourself you know what I mean it's even more ridiculous in powerlifting when the only
36:21
difference is registering or not registering at least as far as they are concerned all all three those ladies are
36:27
qualified yeah like so you know they can be there if they want to be there exactly so that's not even but you know
36:34
another thing that's ridiculous about that is is an advertisement yeah neither briani or
36:40
Denise probably chose to be on that flyer right they might have been asked they might have been asked and signed
36:45
off on it but it wasn't their intent to right cause drama right it was just they
36:51
registered for the meat and these people want people to come watch their meat or stream their meat or whatever they want
36:57
eyes on their meat and you have two of the most badass ladies on the planet why wouldn't you advertise for that it is
37:02
what it is another thing too is that Christy Hawkins didn't really go head-to-head with anybody but briani and
37:09
Denise were head-to-head like they were they were like she's in a different weight class not not that okay not not even that it
37:16
was the fact that they were fighting over the deadlift the world the world record deadlift like that's where they
37:22
were bu sing yeah they were buing not a total not the total not not the squat where Christy Hawkins apparently crushed
37:29
everybody I can't I can't really remember but I think I think I think Hunter Henderson was the
37:35
closest one to her regardless if anybody knows what chrisy Hawkins squatted at the American Pro let
37:41
us know right I'm sure it was I'm sure it was at least 300 kilos or more but I
37:47
couldn't tell you off the top of my head um because I'm I'm if I'm not mistaken Hunter Henderson went for 300 and missed
37:54
it and I could also be wrong about that but it's it's somewhere around there
37:59
regardless they they have kind of had like some Feud some fight like there was
38:05
this back and forth like all love at the end of it but during competition you
38:10
could tell they were getting like chippy yeah which is fine and I I think I think
38:15
looking at it from this lens right them two are going at it the the correct way
38:22
they're respecting each other they're not like accusing anybody of anything they're being a little chippy like
38:29
that's the kind of rivalry rivalry that we want to see Christy Hawkins is just stirring the [ __ ] pot because she's got
38:36
a bruised ego because she's not advertised in Meet she's not going to does she not seriously have like a 40 or 50 points dots higher than both these
38:43
girls I'm sure it's something like it's nearly untouchable right I'm pretty sure it's close to 700 yeah I think it's I think it is 700 it might be 700 she
38:50
might be the only lifter with a 700 pound 700 DOT score I'm sorry not pound a 700 DOT score but
38:57
like when you're that far ahead she's basically the female John hack right right yeah not not punchable at this
39:02
current time now that is to say with all this stuff going on I don't know that briani might not just start busting her
39:09
ass and be like you know what we can go up weight classes we can do this we can do that we can do whatever we need to do like she's just going to try her best to
39:16
to break every record that she has right so I mean I guess it's just it feels so weird
39:25
and outside because like if you have a problem with this just register for the meat yeah register and go in if you go
39:32
you know if you're that far ahead of them already like you know chances are even on a bad day you probably beat them
39:38
yeah like go get your second attempts and win if you're as far ahead in dots as I think she is like she goes 5 for nine 6 for nine
39:46
she beats them anyway right like just register for the meat if it's that big of a deal like why make a full of
39:51
yourself and a full of powerlifting and I don't think it looks good necessarily because like I said I
39:57
do think we're trying to make it a bigger spectator mhm involved sport like that's something I want you know what I
40:03
mean like now on on The Devil's Advocate side of this as far as the drama helps
40:10
sometimes Conor McGregor brought a lot of eyes to the uh uh UFC right because
40:15
he talks [ __ ] because he talks [ __ ] because by and large he backed it up by and that is to say Christy Hawkins can
40:22
back it up right she has the DOT score to back it up but it's it's a matter of like I don't
40:31
know just the way it feel it feels really weird cuz powerlifting for most
40:36
of us is not about that powerlifting has been a really welcoming warm
40:42
community and then you know there's always outliers there's always people especially on the untested side who are
40:49
a little aggressive more so than they should be both men and women like not
40:54
not trying to say it's just the women here are some of the men are really talk all
41:00
day about uh what's his face it is what it is probably don't need to name names
41:05
but probably not but but yeah I mean Mr Mr Texas who knows Jiu-Jitsu and owns a lot of guns yeah I mean I really can't
41:11
think of his name uh you're talking about thisle white I thought you were talking about somebody local for a second no no no no this but like yeah I
41:18
mean that guy like honestly when he started that I thought he was the best the best thing for powerlifting I think he got tired mhm and he did start
41:25
getting a little hurtful a little personal but I was thinking like damn you know what this is like this is kind
41:31
of make powerlifting kind of chippy this is going be cool like when he's started I followed him for a long time and I was
41:36
a fan like I was like this guy's like like you you used to say he's the heel of powerlifting like it was really cool
41:43
to have that kind of person until it became more than that and it took
41:48
everybody going like this guy's kind of a [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah like it took a lot of it it took a lot of like when he
41:53
was actually in people's comments telling them they sucked and stuff like that like when it was just the funny
41:59
Instagram stories like it was great it was great yeah like everybody was on board like this is cool and then it's
42:05
like personal attacks on people that are genuine nice people genuinely nice people and stuff like that it's kind of
42:11
you know that kind of started to suck yeah and we talked about another person that's he's not local to us but he
42:16
competes around here a lot that I know to be a very very good and nice
42:22
man actually one of my favorite people I've ever been around in about a p power to meet and if you saw him on Instagram
42:27
you would think he was the biggest [ __ ] in the world like I mean there are people that are trying to carry some
42:33
type of persona right and I don't know if they think it's for the good of powerlifting or not but I mean it does kind of it does kind of rub in the wrong
42:41
way you know what I mean especially when you know them and know them to be different in person like and that could
42:46
be the Christy Hawkins situation I don't know I know briani said in the comments
42:51
that she had nothing but respect and always was grateful to talk to Christie and always you know
43:00
tried to be nice to her and she said if she ever made any comments that seemed like they were negative towards her it
43:06
wasn't on purpose it was really just asking a question I wonder if it's just knowing that she's a little bit older
43:11
than the rest of these ladies and that her time's coming her time I mean her time's probably coming it really is I
43:17
mean it might be 10 more years I mean that's a big DOT score right I mean it
43:22
might it might go untouched forever I mean we don't we don't know but like but Brian's not also the the the possibility
43:29
that maybe she's on the tail end of things MH and maybe maybe her records are never broken but maybe she starts
43:35
losing Meats maybe that's something that's on her mind I don't know but like um but even so but like at her age she
43:41
has the opportunity to compete not open if if she wants to if she wants to
43:47
continue competing open she has to just understand that is just life we get
43:52
older we get weaker we get frailer like we can we can hold on to as much as we can I think what particularly sucks and
44:00
if there's any women listening by all means chime in because I'm not trying to speak for you um this is always
44:06
dangerous when a man talks about anything maybe from the perspective of a woman um and I don't want to necessarily
44:13
do that I want to be respectful in what I'm about to say 100% but there's enough
44:18
stigma around strong women anyway yeah to be honest there's a lot of
44:24
reservation about women getting started the lifting weights in to begin with there's even reservation and lifters at
44:31
my girls that have been doing it a long time um they're they have their own reservations every meet's like their
44:37
first meet sometimes because of something a man said to them or something another woman said to him or
44:42
something like that like there are so many like reservations about it anyway that I just feel like somebody that's
44:48
been doing it as long as her M has an opportunity to to to stand in the
44:54
position of a mentor right and set good quality examples for other women coming behind her and uh I don't think she done
45:02
she's done that yeah and this instance definitely not uh Tammy just had a comment what did Tammy say she said amen
45:09
amen I mean like just so just just to backtrack a little bit because I just want to bring this up because because it
45:16
is really important um in regards with uh you were saying about how there's a
45:21
stigma with women lifting so I've mentioned this to you before uh I back and forth a little bit with
45:28
Sarah soac on Instagram who was also at the American Pro um she's really really
45:34
a sweet lady she really is um but she was telling me at her gym that the men
45:41
there so she lives in Croatia so it's it's a different part of the world but the men there would actively take bars
45:48
take weight off bars that she was using they would like tell her she's her her
45:53
she told me her boyfriend told her she was fat and ugly because she was a powerlifter and that powerlifting was
45:59
the cause of her being fat and ugly that's patently untrue patently un true she actually she competes in the 165
46:06
class I believe no body I'm sorry she was lower than that I think she was the 65
46:12
kilos um regardless very strong very fit woman she's not overweight she's not fat
46:19
she's she's just strong um but guys around there are telling her her legs are too big and no guy's going to her
46:26
cuz her legs are too big and I'm just like this is insane like it's really insane to think that there are people
46:32
like that still out there that haven't really like that's and but that's my
46:37
point like women in general are getting x amount of [ __ ] from men already yeah not men like me or you right
46:45
but honestly probably average Jim bro be honest who can't they're getting they're
46:50
getting x amount of [ __ ] already you have somebody like this that has like Chrissy Hawkins that hasn't has the
46:56
ability to set a good example and to help break stigmas and to help encourage women to
47:02
do it anyway and then like does this to other
47:08
strong women what message that send to people that aren't on Brian's level or
47:13
that aren't on Denise Herbert's level that like up up and coming women like this is how I'm going to be treated so I
47:20
don't even want to do this like I don't know I know this is one person like this is one this is one person but I do think
47:26
that there we do have some type of a Duty man or woman to not just be a
47:31
complete [ __ ] all the time because there are people coming up behind us that need encouraged uh and need help
47:37
and guidance and I think that's especially true of women just based on having coached women I feel like uh
47:43
anything we can do to help shatter a stigma is probably a good thing and I don't think she's helped that just a
47:49
small side point um on the men's side of that um John hack is the best mail
47:56
lifter period right now DOT score and he doesn't like actively go at people he
48:02
doesn't actively like attack people all he does is post memes yeah like and post
48:07
his lifting stuff he does he doesn't really have like a huge social media presence he's not like
48:13
actively trying to promote anything or he's like I've got my app I've got my
48:21
supplements uh sponsors and that's pretty much it and then just posts his he posts like a regular Instagram
48:28
account which I think is great and it's refreshing and it's not he doesn't treat it like it's got to be some type of business right he's just like here's my
48:34
stuff here's my links do what you want with it I'm chill I'm John hack you know
48:40
I'm the strongest man on the it is what it is uh Tammy said pretty much just to just to kind of
48:45
um she's talking about it being disheartening like those types of attitudes and whatnot you can either
48:50
choose for it to be disheartening or choose for it to be Fuel and she obviously chooses fuel and soon she goes
48:56
on to say that most of the bad comment she gets is from men that are weaker than her oh yeah all the time it all it
49:01
goes back to something we say all the time that most of this [ __ ] comes from below and never comes from above which
49:07
is why it's really weird for Christy Hawkins to be doing this right well you know that's kind of yeah but that's part
49:15
of the problem you know that's that's uh that's why we're talking about that's why we're talking about it yeah I mean
49:20
it's like again you have an opportunity to break a stigma to be a positive
49:28
influence on people's lives and uh instead you're just tearing them down for literally no reason other than your
49:34
own this girl is 15 years younger than you mhm is she 30 I don't think she's 30 she might not even be 30 but you're
49:40
talking about somebody that's like she's very very talented she's younger than you probably could stand to learn a lot
49:46
from you you could do that for her you're you've got 700 dots yep you
49:53
can help her and as much as you want to help her and it might take her 15 more years if she goes uninjured to beat you
49:59
if it even happens you know what I mean like you're probably going to be dead and gone before those records are broken
50:05
potentially I mean Ser I mean it's a 700 dots the likelihood of that happening is is pretty [ __ ] huge like you have the
50:11
ability to be a hero mhm and you actively choose not to not to be and the
50:19
only thing you have to do to be a hero is just be nice yeah that's the only you don't have to go way to be an [ __ ] or
50:25
anything like that you just got to be nice all the drama could have been avoided if all she commented was good
50:30
job girls yeah like literally everyone would have been super like hell yeah that's awesome yeah everybody would
50:36
loved it you think about like Eddie Cohen think about all the good he's done for
50:42
powerlifting to my I'm sure that there was some he had chippy moments when he was a powerlifter and breaking records
50:47
and stuff too that guy since he's been done has done nothing but help the powerlifting Community never once have
50:53
you seen Eddie Cohen get on online and [ __ ] on somebody for breaking a dlift record that he set or something like
51:00
that right never seen him do it you have the ability I mean you have the ability to be that guy right or that woman or
51:06
whatever like and you know he's considered the greatest of all time for a lot of reasons and that might be one of them
51:13
because of what he's giving back to it but you can do you can still be a hero and do even less than Eddie's done just
51:20
by being nice y you ain't even got to give back just be nice and encourage the girls that are coming back behind you
51:25
and that's that's it that's enough yeah that's enough yeah absolutely you don't even have to go above and beyond but
51:30
instead you go above and beyond to be hurtful to be hurtful and that sucks
51:35
like that sucks so bad um it's disappointing I'll be honest with you
51:41
like chrisy is somebody I've always been aware of I know how and I've always been aware of how good she was but she's
51:48
never been like when I think of like powerlifting Heroes like on the female side of things she's never the first
51:54
person I think about probably because she's a generation up on me right she's old enough to be my mom nearly you know
52:00
what I mean like there's nothing wrong with that but like there's a little bit of an age gap between her and the people
52:05
we see regularly like most the time I think about people like briani or or Hunter Henderson
52:10
or I think about uh Stephie Cohen yeah I mean Stephie Cohen was the first woman
52:15
that I just was nuts just nuts uh Marana Garian and then um even more so and Her
52:24
Name Escapes Me I don't know why I think it's because I've been drinking but Brandon's Brandon's girl um I don't know
52:31
probably going to be the first girl to bench press uh she'll probably be the first girl to bench press 400 in
52:36
competition I'm trying to think of her name right now and if I had my phone I'd look at it um but uh I think her
52:42
Instagram handle is like Quadzilla or something see I don't remember um but I mean like she's not always been the
52:49
first person I've thought of by no means Karina Davis Karina Davis yeah absolutely that girl is absolutely
52:55
standing like super [ __ ] strong um but you know chriss's not necessarily the first person I've thought of but
53:01
like it's probably because there's a little bit she's been in it a little bit longer than everybody else and she's not just like in the front of my mind well she's
53:09
she's not being she's not being like fed to me by the algorithm I mean like I'm not seeing her you know what I mean
53:15
exactly what I was going to say is that she's just not as popular on Instagram so her post don't get shared as much
53:20
like she's not treating her Instagram like a business whereas Joe and briani absolutely treat their
53:26
yeah those people are people I see a whole lot of you know what I mean um so
53:31
no disrespect to her I mean she's she's the best in the world for a reason like but you know I do think it's a little
53:37
bit of a generational thing I'm just not seeing her I mean it just is what it is I mean uh honestly people her age I
53:43
generally think about Jen Thompson first even though she's you know drug tested and everything else that's generally the
53:49
first woman I think of in her age group you know most of the time but uh and then I don't know how old Denise Herber
53:56
is I think she's in her 30s you know but but anyway I I even see her a little bit
54:01
less I know she's great too but like I don't know like I said you you have the opportunity to set an example
54:08
even if you're not seen as much right why not that example I mean it's just
54:14
really really annoying to me as a coach that somebody didn't do their due diligence before they open their [ __ ] mouth right that's like 101 I have made
54:23
mistakes because I didn't know a rule book mhm like I should have me and you
54:28
talked about that We've joked around a lot about that with Ron because he everybody's heard the story a thousand
54:34
times because he beat me because he knew the rules better you know what I mean it is what it is um he makes great [ __ ]
54:42
calls whether I win or loss based based on doesn't matter it is my responsibility as a coach or a lifter to
54:48
know the [ __ ] rule book and before you start making huge accusations about somebody cheating you should know the
54:54
rule book right that's what it all boils down to to me I mean and then outside of
54:59
that like honestly like if you want to make this mistake on the front end like
55:04
don't double down on it right apologize apologize and be like hey you know what if I would have been more familiar with
55:10
the rules none of this happens y own it like you know what I mean like
55:15
be like hey like I messed up this this is my bad no disrespect to them at all I
55:20
thought this was an egregious thing turned out it's the way it's been I'm sorry yep you know what I mean that's
55:25
what should have happened that is what should have happened and there may again it may be an ego thing right it may just be that her ego is not allowing her to I
55:33
mean to apologize because there that's how some people are I don't know Christie I don't know maybe she thought she was going to get like the [ __ ]
55:39
Nick Sabin treatment and I know people are going to roll their eyes but rules got changed for Nick Sabin because of
55:46
the 2013 iron ball and one of them was one of them was how far downfield
55:51
lineman could be on a pass play right originally it was three yards downfield and because he got [ __ ]
55:58
gashed by the RPO game in the 2013 iron ball they changed in the off season to where linan can only be one yard
56:04
downfield on an RPO any type of passing play basically but maam was using these
56:09
rpos they looked like running plays and he was actively passing because he could he had three yards to to play with his
56:15
lineman right I don't know if she thought that maybe I'm Christy Hawkins I have a 700 DOT score if I [ __ ] about
56:22
this they'll change the rules for me or what or they'll retroactively say you
56:28
know uh oh Christy's right this is a [ __ ] up rule let's change it or what whatever she expected to happen maybe
56:35
that maybe her ego is that big but uh regardless that due diligence wasn't
56:40
done let's go ahead and just just for the sake of the podcast we technical rule book pulled up now this is the 2024
56:46
though this is the 2024 so if there's an edit to it you know that this is basically what we
56:52
are um going to be looking at essentially is just what is
57:00
the current rules did it change because she brought it up that's that's really what I'm curious about I highly [ __ ]
57:06
doubt it but I mean I could be wrong if I can find it now this this may
