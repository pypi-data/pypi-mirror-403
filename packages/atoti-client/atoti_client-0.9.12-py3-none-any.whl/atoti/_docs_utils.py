QUANTILE_DOC = """Return a measure equal to the requested quantile {what}.

    Here is how to obtain the same behavior as `these standard quantile calculation methods <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile#Estimating_quantiles_from_a_sample>`__:

    * R-1: ``mode="centered"`` and ``interpolation="lower"``
    * R-2: ``mode="centered"`` and ``interpolation="midpoint"``
    * R-3: ``mode="simple"`` and ``interpolation="nearest"``
    * R-4: ``mode="simple"`` and ``interpolation="linear"``
    * R-5: ``mode="centered"`` and ``interpolation="linear"``
    * R-6 (similar to Excel's ``PERCENTILE.EXC``): ``mode="exc"`` and ``interpolation="linear"``
    * R-7 (similar to Excel's ``PERCENTILE.INC``): ``mode="inc"`` and ``interpolation="linear"``
    * R-8 and R-9 are not supported

    The formulae given for the calculation of the quantile index assume a 1-based indexing system.

    Args:
        {measure_or_operand}: The {measure_or_operand} to get the quantile of.
        q: The quantile to take.
            For instance, ``0.95`` is the 95th percentile and ``0.5`` is the median.
        mode: The method used to calculate the index of the quantile.
            Available options are, when searching for the *q* quantile of a vector ``X``:

            * ``simple``: ``len(X) * q``
            * ``centered``: ``len(X) * q + 0.5``
            * ``exc``: ``(len(X) + 1) * q``
            * ``inc``: ``(len(X) - 1) * q + 1``

        interpolation: If the quantile index is not an integer, the interpolation decides what value is returned.
            The different options are, considering a quantile index ``k`` with ``i < k < j`` for a sorted vector ``X``:

            * ``linear``: ``v = X[i] + (X[j] - X[i]) * (k - i)``
            * ``lower``: ``v = X[i]``
            * ``higher``: ``v = X[j]``
            * ``nearest``: ``v = X[i]`` or ``v = X[j]`` depending on which of ``i`` or ``j`` is closest to ``k``
            * ``midpoint``: ``v = (X[i] + X[j]) / 2``
