    """Create a context allowing to use the experimental features with the passed keys.

    Warning:
        Experimental features are subject to breaking changes in any release.

    Args:
        feature_keys: The keys of the experimental features allowed to be used inside the context.

            If a :class:`~collections.abc.Callable` is passed, it will be called with the keys of all the experimental features and it must return the keys to allow.

    Example:

        .. doctest::
            :hide:

            >>> from ._experimental import experimental
            >>> @experimental("foo")
            ... def foo(): ...
            >>> class Bar:
            ...     @property
            ...     @experimental()
            ...     def prop(self): ...

            >>> @experimental("baz", stability="stable")
            ... def baz(): ...

        By default, calling an experimental function/method raises an error:

        >>> foo()
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        RuntimeError: This API is experimental, use `with tt.experimental({'foo'}): ...` to allow it.

        >>> bar = Bar()
        >>> bar.prop
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        RuntimeError: This API is experimental, use `with tt.experimental({'Bar.prop'}): ...` to allow it.

        An experimental feature can be used by passing its key to this function:

        >>> with tt.experimental({"foo"}):
        ...     foo()

        Multiple keys can be passed:

        >>> with tt.experimental({"foo", "Bar.prop"}):
        ...     foo()
        ...     bar.prop

        Nesting is supported too:

        >>> with tt.experimental({"foo"}):
        ...     foo()
        ...     with tt.experimental({"Bar.prop"}):
        ...         foo()
        ...         bar.prop
        ...     foo()

        Once a feature is stabilized, passing its key to this function will raise a deprecation warning:

        >>> with tt.experimental({"baz"}):
        ...     None
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        FutureWarning: Experimental feature with key `baz` has been stabilized, stop passing its key.

        Passing a key that does not match any feature will raise an error:

        >>> with tt.experimental({"quux"}):  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
        ...     None
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        ValueError: No experimental feature with key `quux`, existing keys are ...

        .. doctest::
            :hide:

            >>> for key in ["foo", "Bar.prop", "baz"]:
            ...     _FEATURES.unregister(key)
