# Getting Started

This section gets you from zero to a working inference.

## What You'll Learn

1. How to run Datasculpt on a dataset
2. What the output means (shape, grain, roles)
3. How to handle ambiguous datasets
4. Where Datasculpt fits in your data pipeline

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- pandas 2.0+

## Reading Order

1. **[Quickstart](quickstart.md)** — Run your first inference
2. **[Mental Model](mental-model.md)** — Understand the core concepts
3. **[Examples](../examples/index.md)** — See inference in action on different dataset shapes
