PTED (pronounced "ted") takes in `x` and `y` two datasets and determines if they
were sampled from the same underlying distribution. It produces a p-value under
the null hypothesis that they are sampled from the same distribution. The
samples may be multi-dimensional, and the p-value is "exact" meaning it has a
correctly calibrated type I error rate regardless of the data distribution.

## Install

To install PTED, run the following:

```bash
pip install pted
```

If you want to run PTED on GPUs using PyTorch, then also install torch:

```bash
pip install torch
```

The two functions are ``pted.pted`` and ``pted.pted_coverage_test``. For
information about each argument, just use ``help(pted.pted)`` or
``help(pted.pted_coverage_test)``. 

## What does PTED do?

You can think of it like a multi-dimensional KS-test! Although it works entirely
differently from the KS-test, this gives you some idea of how useful it is! It
is used for two sample testing and posterior coverage tests. In some cases it is
even more sensitive than the KS-test, but likely not all cases.

PTED is useful for:

* "were these two samples drawn from the same distribution?" this works even with noise, so long as the noise distribution is also the same for each sample
* Evaluate the coverage of a posterior sampling procedure, and check over/under-confidence
* Check for MCMC chain convergence. Split the chain in half or take two chains, that's two samples that PTED can work with (PTED assumes samples are independent, make sure to thin your chain accordingly!)
* Evaluate the performance of a generative ML model. PTED is powerful here as it can detect overfitting to the training sample (ensure `two_tailed = True` to check this).
* Evaluate if a simulator generates true "data-like" samples
* PTED (or just the energy distance) can be a distance metric for Approximate Bayesian Computing posteriors
* Check for drift in a time series, comparing samples before/after some cutoff time

And much more!

## Example: Two-Sample-Test

```python
from pted import pted
import numpy as np

x = np.random.normal(size = (500, 10)) # (n_samples_x, n_dimensions)
y = np.random.normal(size = (400, 10)) # (n_samples_y, n_dimensions)

p_value = pted(x, y)
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.3f}") # expect uniform random from 0-1
```

## Example: Coverage Test

```python
from pted import pted_coverage_test
import numpy as np

g = np.random.normal(size = (100, 10)) # ground truth (n_simulations, n_dimensions)
s = np.random.normal(size = (200, 100, 10)) # posterior samples (n_samples, n_simulations, n_dimensions)

p_value = pted_coverage_test(g, s)
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.3f}") # expect uniform random from 0-1
```

Note, you can also provide a filename via a parameter: `sbc_histogram = "sbc_hist.pdf"` and this will generate an SBC histogram from the test[^1].

## How it works

### Two sample test

PTED uses the energy distance of the two samples `x` and `y`, this is computed as:

$$d = \frac{2}{n_xn_y}\sum_{i,j}||x_i - y_j|| - \frac{1}{n_x^2}\sum_{i,j}||x_i - x_j|| - \frac{1}{n_y^2}\sum_{i,j}||y_i - y_j||$$

The energy distance measures distances between pairs of points. It becomes more
positive if the `x` and `y` samples tend to be further from each other than from
themselves. We demonstrate this in the figure below, where the `x` samples are
drawn from a (thick) circle, while the `y` samples are drawn from a (thick)
line.

![pted demo test](media/test_PTED.png)

In the left figure, we show the two distributions, which by eye are clearly not
drawn from the same distribution (circle and line). In the center figure we show
the individual distance measurements as histograms. To compute the energy
distance, we would sum all the elements in these histograms rather than binning
them. You can also see a schematic of the distance matrix, which represents
every pair of samples and is colour coded the same as the histograms. In the
right figure we show the energy distance as a vertical line, the grey
distribution is explained below.

The next element of PTED is the permutation test. For this we combine the `x`
and `y` samples into a single collection `z`. We then randomly shuffle (permute)
the `z` collection and break it back into `x` and `y`, now with samples randomly
swapped between the two distributions (though they are the same size as before).
If we compute the energy distance again, we will get very different results.
This time we are sure that the null hypothesis is true, `x` and `y` have been
drawn from the same distribution (`z`), and so the energy distance will be quite
low. If we do this many times and track the permuted energy distances we get a
distribution, this is the grey distribution in the right figure. Below we show
an example of what this looks like.

![pted demo permute](media/permute_PTED.png)

Here we see the `x` and `y` samples have been scrambled in the left figure. In
the center figure we see the components of the energy distance matrix are much
more consistent because `x` and `y` now follow the same distribution (a mixture
of the original circle and line distribution). In the right figure we now see
that the vertical line is situated well within the grey distribution. Indeed the
grey distribution is just a histogram of many re-runs of this procedure. We
compute a p-value by taking the fraction of the energy distances that are
greater than the current one.

### Coverage test

In the coverage test we have some number of simulations `nsim` where there is a
true value `g` and some posterior samples `s`. The procedure goes like this,
first you sample from your prior: `g ~ Prior(G)`. Then you sample from your
likelihood: `x ~ Likelihood(X | g)`. Then you sample from your posterior: 
`s ~ Posterior(S | x)`, you will want many samples `s`. You repeat this 
procedure `nsim` times. The `g` and `s` samples are what you need for the test.

Internally, for each simulation separately we use PTED to compute a p-value,
essentially asking the question "was `g` drawn from the distribution that
generated `s`?". Individually, these tests are possibly not especially
informative (unless the sampler is really bad), however their p-values must have
been drawn from `U(0,1)` under the null-hypothesis[^2]. Thus we just need a way
to combine their statistical power. It turns out that for some `p ~ U(0,1)`, we
have that `- 2 ln(p)` is chi2 distributed with `dof = 2`. This means that we can
sum the chi2 values for the PTED test on each simulation and compare with a chi2
distribution with `dof = 2 * nsim`. We use a density based two tailed p-value
test on this chi2 distribution meaning that if your posterior is underconfident
or overconfident, you will get a small p-value that can be used to reject the
null.

## Example: Sensitivity comparison with KS-test

There is no single universally optimal two sample test, but a widely used method
in 1D is called the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)-test. The KS-test operates
fundamentally differently from PTED and can only really work in 1D. Here I do a
super basic comparison of the two methods. Draw two samples of 100 Gaussian
distributed points, thus the null hypothesis is true for these points. Then
slowly bias one of the samples by changing the standard deviation up to 2 sigma.
By tracking how the p-value drops we can see which method is more sensitive to
this kind of mismatched sample. If you run this test a hundred times you will
find that PTED is more sensitive to this kind of bias than the KS-test. Observe
that both methods start around p=0.5 in the true null case (scale = 1), since
they are both exact tests that truly sample U(0,1) under the null.

```python
from pted import pted
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import kstest
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(0)

scale = np.linspace(1.0, 2.0, 10)
pted_p = np.zeros((10, 100))
ks_p = np.zeros((10, 100))
for i, s in enumerate(scale):
    for trial in range(100):
        x = np.random.normal(size=(100, 1))
        y = np.random.normal(scale=s, size=(100, 1))
        pted_p[i][trial] = pted(x, y, two_tailed=False)
        ks_p[i][trial] = kstest(x[:, 0], y[:, 0]).pvalue

plt.plot(scale, np.mean(pted_p, axis=1), linewidth=3, c="b", label="PTED")
plt.plot(scale, np.mean(ks_p, axis=1), linewidth=3, c="r", label="KS")
plt.legend()
plt.ylim(0, None)
plt.xlim(1, 2.0)
plt.xlabel("Out of distribution scale [*sigma]")
plt.ylabel("p-value")

plt.savefig("pted_demo.png", bbox_inches="tight")
plt.show()
```

## Interpreting the results

### Two sample test

This is a null hypothesis test, thus we are specifically asking the question:
"if `x` and `y` were drawn from the same distribution, how likely am I to have
observed an energy distance as extreme as this?" This is fundamentally different
from the question "how likely is it that `x` and `y` were drawn from the same
distribution?" Which is really what we would like to ask, but I am unaware of
how we would do that in a meaningful way. It is also important to note that we
are specifically looking at extreme energy distances, so we are not even really
talking about the probability densities directly. If there was a transformation
between `x` and `y` that the energy distance was insensitive to, then the two
distributions could potentially be arbitrarily different without PTED
identifying it. For example, since the default energy distance is computed with
the Euclidean distance, a single dimension in which the values are orders of
magnitude larger than the others could make it so that all other dimensions are
ignored and could be very different. For this reason we suggest using the metric
`mahalanobis` if this is a potential issue in your data.

### Coverage Test

For the coverage test we apply the PTED two sample test to each simulation
separately. We then combine the resulting p-values using chi squared where the
resulting degrees of freedom is 2 times the number of simulations. Because of
this, we can detect underconfidence or overconfidence. Specifically we detect
the average over/under confidence, it is possible to be overconfident in some
parts of the posterior and underconfident in others. Underconfidence is when the
posterior distribution is too large, it covers the ground truth by spreading too
thin and not fully exploiting the information in the prior/likelihood of the
posterior sampling process. Sometimes this is acceptable/expected, for example
when using Approximate Bayesian Computation one expects the posterior to be at
least slightly underconfident. Overconfidence is when the posterior is too
narrow and so the ground truth appears as an outlier from its perspective. This
can occur in two main ways, one is by having a too narrow posterior. This could
occur if the measurement uncertainty estimates were too low or there were
sources of error not accounted for in the model. Another way is if your
posterior is biased, you may have an appropriately broad posterior, but it is in
the wrong part of your parameter space. PTED has no way to distinguish these or
other modes of overconfidence, however just knowing under/over-confidence can be
powerful. As such, by default the PTED coverage test will warn users as to which
kind of failure mode they are in if the `warn_confidence` parameter is not
`None` (default is 1e-3).

### Necessary but not Sufficient

PTED is a null hypothesis test. This means we assume the null hypothesis is true
and compute a probability for how likely we are to have a pair of datasets with
a certain energy distance. If PTED gives a very low p-value then it is probably
safe to reject that null hypothesis (at the significance given by the p-value).
However, if the p-value is high and you cannot reject the null, then that does
not mean the two samples were drawn from the same distribution! Merely that PTED
could not find any significant discrepancies. The samples could have been drawn
from the same distribution, or PTED could be insensitive to the deviation, or
maybe the test needs more samples. In some sense PTED (like all null hypothesis
tests) is "necessary but not sufficient" in that failing the test is bad news
for the null, but passing the test is possibly inconclusive[^3]. Use your judgement,
and contact me or some smarter stat-oriented person if you are unsure about the
results you are getting!

## GPU Compatibility

PTED works on both CPU and GPU. All that is needed is to pass the `x` and `y` as
PyTorch Tensors on the appropriate device.

Example:
```python
from pted import pted
import numpy as np
import torch

x = np.random.normal(size = (500, 10)) # (n_samples_x, n_dimensions)
y = np.random.normal(size = (400, 10)) # (n_samples_y, n_dimensions)

p_value = pted(torch.tensor(x), torch.tensor(y))
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.3f}") # expect uniform random from 0-1
```

## Memory and Compute limitations

If a GPU isn't enough to get PTED running fast enough for you, or if you are
running into memory limitations, there are still options! We can use an
approximation of the energy distance, in this case the test is still exact but
less sensitive than it would be otherwise. We can approximate the energy
distance by taking random subsamples (chunks) of the full dataset, computing the
energy distance, then averaging. Just set the `chunk_size` parameter for the
number of samples you can manage at once and set the `chunk_iter` for the number
of trials you want in the average. The larger these numbers are, the closer the
estimate will be to the true energy distance, but it will take more compute.
This lets you decide how to trade off compute for sensitivity.

Note that the computational complexity for standard PTED goes as 
`O((n_samp_x + n_samp_y)^2)` while the chunked version goes as 
`O(chunk_iter * (2 * chunk_size)^2)` so plan your chunking accordingly.

Example:
```python
from pted import pted
import numpy as np

x = np.random.normal(size = (500, 10)) # (n_samples_x, n_dimensions)
y = np.random.normal(size = (400, 10)) # (n_samples_y, n_dimensions)

p_value = pted(x, y, chunk_size = 50, chunk_iter = 100)
print(f"p-value: {p_value:.3f}") # expect uniform random from 0-1
```

If you think those are neat, then you'll probably also like this paper, which uses HDP regions and a KS-test. It has the same feel as PTED but works differently, so the two are complimentary.
