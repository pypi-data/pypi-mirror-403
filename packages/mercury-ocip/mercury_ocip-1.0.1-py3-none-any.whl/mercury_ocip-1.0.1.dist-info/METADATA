## Overview

**Mercury** has extensive documentation, automation, and more to better manage Broadworks instances.

The package is currently actively managed by the Dev Team at [Fourteen IP](https://fourteenip.com/) the leading solution of hosted telephony in the hospitality industry. The team is working with the whole company including platform and telephony engineers with decades of experience.

The goal of the solution is to ease the management of Broadworks and give engineers tooling to better configure and administrate.

## Installation

Install Mercury using pip:

```bash
pip install mercury-ocip
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from mercury import Client

#SOAP (recommended for most cases):
client = Client(
    host="https://your-server.com",  # No /wsdl suffix needed
    username="your_user",
    password="your_pass",
    conn_type="SOAP"
)

#TCP (for legacy systems or specific requirements):
client = AsyncClient(
    host="broadworks.company.com",
    port=2209,  # Usually 2209/2208 for TCP
    username="admin",
    password="password",
    conn_type="TCP",
    tls=True  # Set False for unencrypted (not recommended)
)

# example usage
response = client.raw_command("SystemSoftwareVersionGetRequest")

print(response)
# Returns: SystemSoftwareVersionGetResponse(version='24')

print(response.to_dict()) 
# Returns: {'version': '24'}

print(response.to_json()) 
# Returns: '{'version': '24'}'

print(response.to_xml()) 
# Returns: <command ... "SystemSoftwareVersionGetResponse"><version>24</version></command>
```

### Agent Usage (In Development)

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from mercury import Client, Agent

client = Client(
    host="url",
    username="username",
    password="password",
)

agent = Agent.get_instance(client)

agent.automate.find_alias(
    "servicePovider",
    "groupId",
    alias=0
) # returns Broadworks enity where alias is assigned.

agent.bulk.create_users_from_csv(
    path="local/file/path"
) # Bulk builds all users in predefined bulk sheet
```
