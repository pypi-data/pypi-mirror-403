# aa-captrack

AllianceAuth plugin for tracking and alerting on capital ship activity within your corporation or alliance.

Version: **v1.0.0**  
Status: **Stable Baseline**

## Overview

`aa-captrack` is an AllianceAuth plugin designed to monitor capital ship activity across characters and accounts, providing:

- Real-time dashboard visibility
- Threshold-based alerting
- Discord notifications
- Per-pilot snoozing
- Clear separation between tracked, alerting, and informational states

The plugin prioritises operational clarity and avoids unnecessary alert noise.

## Capital Tracking Logic

| Ship Class | Behavior |
|-----------|---------|
| Titans | Always alerting |
| Supercarriers | Always alerting |
| Dreadnoughts | Alert when ≥ threshold (default: 5) under same main |
| Lancer Dreads | Alert when ≥ threshold |
| Carriers | Alert when ≥ threshold |
| Force Auxiliaries | Alert when ≥ threshold |
| Capital Industrials | Tracked only (no alerts) |

Threshold logic is applied consistently across:
- Dashboard
- Discord alerts
- Background tasks

## Dashboard

- Collapsible cards with rotating chevrons
- Clear separation of:
  - Critical
  - Alerting
  - Informational
- Optional display of unclassified ships
- Configurable refresh interval
- Optional remembered collapse state per user

## Discord Integration

- Discord alerts include **only alerting ships**
- Separate webhooks for:
  - Critical alerts
  - Standard alerts
- Configurable ping behavior (roles / policy)
- Optional inclusion of:
  - System
  - Region
  - Dashboard link

  ## Snoozing

- Snoozing is **per pilot** (by design)
- Supports multiple durations (e.g. 1h / 6h / 24h)
- Snoozed pilots are excluded from:
  - Dashboard alerts
  - Discord notifications

  ## Permissions

| Permission | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `captrack.basic_access` | View dashboard |
| `captrack.admin_access` | Configure settings |
