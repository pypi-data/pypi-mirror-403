## Installation 

It is recommended that latest stable package is released on the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/leymosun/)). PyPI version should be installed via `pip`.

```bash 
pip install leymosun
```

It is recommended that package shouldn't be installed via github version control, unless it is a
specific release.  

## Approach and features

The package provides tools and utilities for randomness based research with `High-Entropy Random Number Generation (HE-RNG)`. It means generation is performed with non-deterministic seeds every time a random library function is called. 

Having non-reproducible and unpredictable RNGs could improve Monte Carlo and similar randomness 
based computational science experimentation. Non-reproducible RNGs can still generate reproducible
research. Critical components in this direction is Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). Leymosun 
implements bootstrapped based UQ and confidence interval generations. 

### High-entropy random number utilities 

The core package is providing strong randomness improving the simulation quality. We use NumPy grammar and as a backend.
* HE-RNG random states. 
* Distributions: 
  * Bionomial
  * Uniform integer on the given range
  * Uniform float on the given range
  * Normal distribution (Gaussian)
  * Random sampling from a set, choice.

### Random Matrices
* Generation of Gaussian ensembles (Orthogonal).
* Generation of Mixed Gaussian ensembles (Orthogonal) via `Mixed Matrix Ensemble Sampling (MMES) algoritm`
* Extract offdiagonal elements.
* Spectra generation given ensemble.
* Robust Spectral unfolding.
* Nearest-Neigbour Spacing Densities (NNSD).
* Adjacent gap ratio.
* Analytic distributions: Wigner semi-circle law, nearest-neigbour spacing.

### Statistics
* Centered PDF computation.
* Bootstrapped uncertainty quantification given observation matrix. 

### Data manager
* Storage object utilities.

## Lectures

Lectures notes that introduce randomization concepts with the usage of `Leymosun`.

* [wigner_semicircle.ipynb](https://github.com/msuzen/leymosun/blob/main/lectures/wigner_semicircle.ipynb): `Lecture on the Wigner's semicircle law`. The Wigner Semicircle law for the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), comparison with the analytical case. 
* [wigner_dyson_spacing.ipynb](https://github.com/msuzen/leymosun/blob/main/lectures/wigner_dyson_spacing.ipynb): `Lecture on the Wigner-Dyson nearest-neighbour distribution`. The Wigner-Dyson spacing law for the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE), comparison with the analytical case. 
* [wigner_semicircle_mixed.ipynb](https://github.com/msuzen/leymosun/blob/main/lectures/wigner_semicircle_mixed.ipynb): `Lecture on the Wigner's cats`. Deviations from the Wigner Semicircle law for the mixed-Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). This would demonstrate, so-called "Wigner's Cats", i.e., the deviation makes the density looks like cat. 
* [mixed_construction.ipynb.ipynb](https://github.com/msuzen/leymosun/blob/main/lectures/mixed_construction.ipynb.ipynb): `Construction of a mixed random matrix ensemble` understanding the inner
details of constructing mixed ensemble.
* [spectral_unfolding.ipynb](https://github.com/msuzen/leymosun/blob/main/lectures/spectral_unfolding.ipynb): ` Self-consistent spectral unfolding` understanding what is a spectral unfolding. 
* [he_rng_nist.ipynb](https://github.com/msuzen/leymosun/blob/main/lectures/he_rng_nist.ipynb): `Lecture on Understanding High-Entropy RNGs with NIST  benchmark`. This lecture provides a way to test different RNGs or usage of RNGs via standard quality tests. 

## Development notes 
* Philosophy  
  There is a common misconception in computational sciences that speed is the ultimate goal, however primary objective is scientific correctness first. For this reasons, scientific correctness is taken precedence over speed in the development of the package. For proven methods being a baseline, we might implement faster versions. 
* Testing 
  * `tests` and `nbconvert` should be present as recommended dependency.
  * Test script should pass before any release. 
    Unit tests `runtests.sh` and lectures `runlectures.sh`. (`lecturePy` directory is needed but this is ignored in the repo via `.gitignore`).
  * Add unit tests for each new method and features. 
  * Add run portion for the new lecture in `runlecture.sh`.
