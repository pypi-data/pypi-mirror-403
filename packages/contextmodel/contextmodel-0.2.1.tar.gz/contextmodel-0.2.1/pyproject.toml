    # Description: Dynamically typed expressions (typing.Any) are disallowed
    # Rationale:
    #  We use Any to allow user to constrain return types of our functions on their own.
    #  For example, having a function `def foo() -> Any: ...` allows user to write
    #  `my_foo: int = foo()` and have it passed type checking, since `Any` as a gradual
    #  form is assignable to any type
