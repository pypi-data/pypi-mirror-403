## Install

* Install the package
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install djangocms-stories-agenda
    ```

* Add it in your `INSTALLED_APPS`:
    ```python
    "djangocms_stories_agenda",
    "recurrence",
    ```

* Run the migration:
    ```sh
    python3 manage.py migrate djangocms_stories_agenda
    ```

* Update the `djangocms-stories` urls by the ones in this module, by using this lovely [setting](https://djangocms-stories.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/urlconf.html):
    ```py
    STORIES_URLCONF = "djangocms_stories_agenda.patched_urls"
    ```

* Create a new blog configuration.
  * Instance namespace: *put what you want*.
  * Application title: *put what you want*.
  * Object name: *put what you want*.
  * [...]
  * <b>Click on <kbd>Layout (Show)</kbd></b>:
    * [...]
    * **Template prefix**: `djangocms_stories_agenda`.
    > That's ***very*** important since this application will check this value multiple times (to update the queryset, to check the templates, to add the post extension "event date" only to the Agenda app...).
  * Save this config.

* ![that's all folks!](https://gitlab.com/-/project/76227599/uploads/d5ae0f217bb16239606b6cabffe82d8e/image.png)

## Explanations/Views/Misc

* A new `Event date` DateTime field has been added to blog posts that have the template prefix set to `djangocms_stories_agenda`.
* A new post list view was created for the Agenda view, it includes all the posts where the `event_date` is set to a date in the future.
* Another view is available at `_("/past/")`, that will display each post where the `event_date` is in the past.
* The templates are *not* in `djangocms_stories/templates` anymore, but in `djangocms_stories_agenda/templates`. Something's not appearing on your templates? Try to edit the file in `djangocms_stories_agenda/templates/`!
* We removed the mention of comments & liveblog in the admin form, because we're not using this.
* We use some very special bits of code that are using some internal features of djangocms-stories (see `misc.py`, and `apps.py`). Try the module before pushing an update.

## Config

### Settings

#### `DJANGOCMS_STORIES_AGENDA_HIDE_UPCOMING_EVENTS_AFTER_CHOICES`
a tuple of choices describing when `AgendaUpcomingEntriesPlugin` will hide events.

Default choices are:
```py
(
    ("start", _("just after event start date")),
    ("start+1h", _("1 hour after event start date")),
    ("start+4h", _("4 hours after event start date")),
    ("start+1d", _("1 day after event start date")),
    ("start+2d", _("2 days after event start date")),
    ("start+3d", _("3 days after event start date")),
    ("start+7d", _("7 days after event start date")),
    ("end", _("just after event end date")),
)
```

#### `DJANGOCMS_STORIES_AGENDA_RECURRENCE_IS_ENABLED`

Wether to enable recurrence for events.

#### `DJANGOCMS_STORIES_AGENDA_RECURRENCE_MAX_DAYS_SEARCH`

Number of days (int) to limit the search of recurring events. Defaults to `365`.

#### `DJANGOCMS_STORIES_AGENDA_TEMPLATE_PREFIXES`

You may need to add multiple agenda blogs with different template prefixes, in order to have different html content or styles for each agenda.

Add this list in your settings so that djangocms-stories-agenda will work (display start_date & end_date in add/update views of the articles):

```py
DJANGOCMS_STORIES_AGENDA_TEMPLATE_PREFIXES = [
    "djangocms_stories_upcoming_calendar",
    "other_djangocms_stories_template_prefix",
    "...",
]
```

> *The default template prefix (`djangocms_stories_agenda`) will still be recognized even if you had this setting, you don't need to add it in the list.*

### Multisite

This modules handles multisite just fine; just add `BLOG_MULTISITE = True` in your settings, and our module will inject the `get_site` function directly inside the class returned by `get_user_model()`! (it is done in AppConfig `ready()` method)

You will then need to create a new "Global Page Permission" entry with your user/group, and to select the site where the user/group will have the right to post new articles/agenda posts.

*If you're curious about this function, [here it is](djangocms_stories_agenda/apps.py).*

### Recurrences

Recurring events are handled with the help of `django-recurrence` package. Only the first event is saved into database, and following recurring events are added into querysets just before they are displayed. Only events that will occur up to `n` days after the first event are displayed. You can change this delay with the setting `DJANGOCMS_STORIES_AGENDA_RECURRENCE_MAX_DAYS_SEARCH`.

*You need to update the way you display dates on the templates in order to show the correct date from a recurring event, like this:*

```jinja2
{% if post.occurrence %}
    {# use post.occurrence here #}
{% else %}
    {% with post_event=post.extension.first %}
        {# use post_event.event_start_date and post_event.event_end_date here #}
    {% endwith %}
{% endif %}
```
