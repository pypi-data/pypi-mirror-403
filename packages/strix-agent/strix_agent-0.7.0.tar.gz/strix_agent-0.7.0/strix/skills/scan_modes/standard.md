# Standard Testing Mode

Balanced security assessment with structured methodology. Thorough coverage without exhaustive depth.

## Approach

Systematic testing across the full attack surface. Understand the application before exploiting it.

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance

**Whitebox (source available)**
- Map codebase structure: modules, entry points, routing
- Identify architecture pattern (MVC, microservices, monolith)
- Trace input vectors: forms, APIs, file uploads, headers, cookies
- Review authentication and authorization flows
- Analyze database interactions and ORM usage
- Check dependencies for known CVEs
- Understand the data model and sensitive data locations

**Blackbox (no source)**
- Crawl application thoroughly, interact with every feature
- Enumerate endpoints, parameters, and functionality
- Fingerprint technology stack
- Map user roles and access levels
- Capture traffic with proxy to understand request/response patterns

## Phase 2: Business Logic Analysis

Before testing for vulnerabilities, understand the application:

- **Critical flows** - payments, registration, data access, admin functions
- **Role boundaries** - what actions are restricted to which users
- **Data access rules** - what data should be isolated between users
- **State transitions** - order lifecycle, account status changes
- **Trust boundaries** - where does privilege or sensitive data flow

## Phase 3: Systematic Testing

Test each attack surface methodically. Spawn focused subagents for different areas.

**Input Validation**
- Injection testing on all input fields (SQL, XSS, command, template)
- File upload bypass attempts
- Search and filter parameter manipulation
- Redirect and URL parameter handling

**Authentication & Session**
- Brute force protection
- Session token entropy and handling
- Password reset flow analysis
- Logout session invalidation
- Authentication bypass techniques

**Access Control**
- Horizontal: user A accessing user B's resources
- Vertical: unprivileged user accessing admin functions
- API endpoints vs UI access control consistency
- Direct object reference manipulation

**Business Logic**
- Multi-step process bypass (skip steps, reorder)
- Race conditions on state-changing operations
- Boundary conditions: negative values, zero, extremes
- Transaction replay and manipulation

## Phase 4: Exploitation

- Every finding requires a working proof-of-concept
- Demonstrate actual impact, not theoretical risk
- Chain vulnerabilities to show maximum severity
- Document full attack path from entry to impact
- Use python tool for complex exploit development

## Phase 5: Reporting

- Document all confirmed vulnerabilities with reproduction steps
- Severity based on exploitability and business impact
- Remediation recommendations
- Note areas requiring further investigation

## Chaining

Always ask: "If I can do X, what does that enable next?" Keep pivoting until reaching maximum privilege or data exposure.

Prefer complete end-to-end paths (entry point → pivot → privileged action/data) over isolated findings. Use the application as a real user would—exploit must survive actual workflow and state transitions.

When you discover a useful pivot (info leak, weak boundary, partial access), immediately pursue the next step rather than stopping at the first win.

## Mindset

Methodical and systematic. Document as you go. Validate everything—no assumptions about exploitability. Think about business impact, not just technical severity.
