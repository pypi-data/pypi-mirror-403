  <tool name="think">
    <description>Use the tool to think about something. It will not obtain new information or change the
  database. Use it when complex reasoning or some cache memory is needed.</description>
    <details>This tool creates dedicated space for structured thinking during complex tasks,
  particularly useful for:
  - Tool output analysis: When you need to carefully process the output of previous tool calls
  - Policy-heavy environments: When you need to follow detailed guidelines and verify compliance
  - Sequential decision making: When each action builds on previous ones and mistakes are costly
  - Multi-step problem solving: When you need to break down complex problems into manageable steps</details>

  # Planning and strategy
  <function=think>
  <parameter=thought>Analysis of the login endpoint SQL injection:

Current State:
- Confirmed SQL injection in POST /api/v1/auth/login
- Backend database is PostgreSQL 14.2
- Application user has full CRUD privileges

Exploitation Strategy:
1. First, enumerate database structure using UNION-based injection
2. Extract user table schema and credentials
3. Check for password hashing (MD5? bcrypt?)
4. Look for admin accounts and API keys

Risk Assessment:
- CVSS Base Score: 9.8 (Critical)
- Attack Vector: Network (remotely exploitable)
- Privileges Required: None
- Impact: Full database compromise

Evidence Collected:
- Error-based injection confirms PostgreSQL
- Time-based payload: admin' AND pg_sleep(5)-- caused 5s delay
- UNION injection reveals 8 columns in users table

Next Actions:
1. Write PoC exploit script in Python
2. Extract password hashes for analysis
3. Create vulnerability report with full details
4. Test if same vulnerability exists in other endpoints</parameter>
