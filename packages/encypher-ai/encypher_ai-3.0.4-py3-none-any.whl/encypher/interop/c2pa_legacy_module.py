"""
C2PA Interoperability Module for Encypher.

This module provides utilities for conceptual interoperability between Encypher's
manifest format and C2PA-like structures. These utilities serve as a bridge for
organizations working with both Encypher (for plain text) and C2PA (for rich media).

Note: This module provides a conceptual mapping, not a fully C2PA-compliant implementation.
The goal is to demonstrate potential interoperability and provide a starting point for
organizations that need to work with both standards.

    Converts an Encypher ManifestPayload to a dictionary using field names
    conceptually aligned with C2PA assertion structures.

    This function provides a conceptual bridge between Encypher's plain-text
    manifest format and C2PA's rich media manifest structure, enabling potential
    interoperability between the two approaches.

        A dictionary with field names aligned with C2PA concepts, containing the
        same information as the original manifest.
