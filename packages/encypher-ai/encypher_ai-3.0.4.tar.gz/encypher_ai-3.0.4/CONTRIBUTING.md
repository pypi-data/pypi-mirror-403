## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/encypher-ai.git
   cd encypher-ai
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Code Style

We follow PEP 8 style guidelines with Black as our code formatter. All code must pass Black formatting checks before being merged.

### Automated Formatting with Pre-commit

We use pre-commit hooks to automatically format code and check for issues before committing. The hooks will:

1. Format code with Black (including Jupyter notebooks)
2. Sort imports with isort
3. Check for common issues with flake8 and ruff
4. Perform type checking with mypy

After installing the pre-commit hooks (step 4 in Development Setup), they will run automatically on each commit.

### Manual Code Formatting

You can also run the formatting tools manually:

```bash
# Format all Python files
black encypher

# Format Python files including Jupyter notebooks
black --jupyter encypher

# Sort imports
isort encypher

# Run all pre-commit hooks on all files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Testing

Please write tests for any new features or bug fixes. We use pytest for testing.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=encypher
```

## Documentation

Please update documentation for any changes. We use docstrings for function and class documentation.

## Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Please ensure that your changes are compatible with the versioning scheme.

## License

By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's license.
