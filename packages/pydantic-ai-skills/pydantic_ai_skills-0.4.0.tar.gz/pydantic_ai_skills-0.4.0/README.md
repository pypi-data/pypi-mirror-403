# pydantic-ai-skills

A standardized, composable framework for building and managing Agent Skills within the Pydantic AI ecosystem.

**Agent Skills** are modular collections of instructions, scripts, tools, and resources that enable AI agents to progressively discover, load, and execute specialized capabilities for domain-specific tasks.

This package implements the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/) for Pydantic AI using a tool-calling approach, maintaining full compatibility with the specification while adapting the loading mechanism for Pydantic AI's architecture. It is also compatible with [Anthropic's Agent Skills framework](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview).

## Quick Start

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic_ai_skills import SkillsToolset

# Initialize Skills Toolset with one or more skill directories
skills_toolset = SkillsToolset(directories=["./skills"])

# Create agent with skills as a toolset
agent = Agent(
    model='openai:gpt-4o',
    instructions='You are a helpful research assistant.',
    toolsets=[skills_toolset]
)

# Add skills instructions to agent (includes skill names and descriptions)
@agent.instructions
async def add_skills(ctx: RunContext) -> str | None:
    """Add skills instructions to the agent's context."""
    return await skills_toolset.get_instructions(ctx)

# Use agent - skills tools are available for the agent to call
user_prompt = "What are the last 3 papers on arXiv about machine learning?"

nodes = []
async with agent.iter(user_prompt) as agent_run:
    async for node in agent_run:
        nodes.append(node)
        print(node)
```

With such data science practices in place, it enables more timely, more insightful and more flexible reporting. However, the quality and integrity of data-science-driven statistics rely on the accuracy and reliability of the data sources and the machine learning techniques that support them. In particular, changes in data sources are inevitable to occur and pose significant risks that are crucial to address in the context of machine learning for official statistics.\n  This paper gives an overview of the main risks, liabilities, and uncertainties associated with changing data sources in the context of machine learning for official statistics. We provide a checklist of the most prevalent origins and causes of changing data sources; not only on a technical level but also regarding ownership, ethics, regulation, and public perception. Next, we highlight the repercussions of changing data sources on statistical reporting. These include technical effects such as concept drift, bias, availability, validity, accuracy and completeness, but also the neutrality and potential discontinuation of the statistical offering. We offer a few important precautionary measures, such as enhancing robustness in both data sourcing and statistical techniques, and thorough monitoring. In doing so, machine learning-based official statistics can maintain integrity, reliability, consistency, and relevance in policy-making, decision-making, and public discourse.\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04338v1\n\nTitle: DOME: Recommendations for supervised machine learning validation in biology\nSummary: Modern biology frequently relies on machine learning to provide predictions and improve decision processes. There have been recent calls for more scrutiny on machine learning performance and possible limitations. Here we present a set of community-wide recommendations aiming to help establish standards of supervised machine learning validation in biology. Adopting a structured methods description for machine learning based on data, optimization, model, evaluation (DOME) will aim to help both reviewers and readers to better understand and assess the performance and limitations of a method or outcome. The recommendations are formulated as questions to anyone wishing to pursue implementation of a machine learning algorithm. Answers to these questions can be easily included in the supplementary material of published papers.\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16189v4\n\nTitle: Learning Curves for Decision Making in Supervised Machine Learning: A Survey\nSummary: Learning curves are a concept from social sciences that has been adopted in the context of machine learning to assess the performance of a learning algorithm with respect to a certain resource, e.g., the number of training examples or the number of training iterations. Learning curves have important applications in several machine learning contexts, most notably in data acquisition, early stopping of model training, and model selection. For instance, learning curves can be used to model the performance of the combination of an algorithm and its hyperparameter configuration, providing insights into their potential suitability at an early stage and often expediting the algorithm selection process. Various learning curve models have been proposed to use learning curves for decision making. Some of these models answer the binary decision question of whether a given algorithm at a certain budget will outperform a certain reference performance, whereas more complex models predict the entire learning curve of an algorithm. We contribute a framework that categorises learning curve approaches using three criteria: the decision-making situation they address, the intrinsic learning curve question they answer and the type of resources they use. We survey papers from the literature and classify them into this framework.\nURL: http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12150v2', tool_call_id='call_oDXHSlx4bpoV3Frm8fvWU8j4', timestamp=datetime.datetime(2025, 12, 18, 23, 27, 18, 930364, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc))]))

## Creating Skills

Skills are filesystem-based directories with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and Markdown instructions.

### Basic Skill Structure

```md
my-skill/
└── SKILL.md # Required: Main instructions and metadata
```

### Extended Skill Structure

```md
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md # Required: Main instructions and metadata
├── FORMS.md # Optional: Form-filling guides
├── REFERENCE.md # Optional: Detailed API reference
├── scripts/ # Optional: Python scripts
│ ├── script1.py
│ └── script2.py
└── resources/ # Optional: Additional files
├── templates/
└── data.json
```

### Minimal SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it
---

# My Skill

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Do specific task A
- Handle scenario B
- Process data type C

## Instructions

1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3
```

### Metadata Requirements

Following [Anthropic's specifications](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/overview#skill-structure):

**Required fields:**

- `name`: Skill identifier (max 64 chars, lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens only)
- `description`: Brief description (max 1024 chars)

You can also include optional fields to help you manage and categorize skills (`version`, `author`, `tags`, etc.). These are not used by the agent.

**Validation:**

- ✅ Names must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only
- ✅ Names cannot contain reserved words: "anthropic", "claude"
- ✅ SKILL.md body should be under 500 lines (warning if exceeded)
- ✅ Descriptions must be under 1024 characters

## How Skills Work

### Progressive Disclosure (Anthropic's Approach)

Skills implement **progressive disclosure** - loading information in stages:

#### Level 1: Metadata (Always Loaded)

- All skill names and descriptions are included in the system prompt
- Enables skill discovery without tool calls
- Minimal token overhead

#### Level 2: Instructions (Loaded When Needed)

- Agent calls `load_skill(name)` to read full instructions
- Only loaded when skill is relevant to the task

#### Level 3: Resources (Loaded As Needed)

- Agent calls `read_skill_resource(skill_name, resource_name)` for additional docs
- Only loaded when referenced or required

### Tool-Calling Adaptation

**Anthropic's Implementation:**

- Claude uses `bash` commands to read files from filesystem
- Skills exist as directories in a VM environment

**Our Implementation:**

- Uses tool-calling instead of bash commands
- Skills are discovered and loaded via Pydantic AI tools
- Maintains the same progressive disclosure pattern
- Skills are structurally compatible with Anthropic's format

## Available Tools

The `SkillsToolset` provides four tools to agents:

### 1. `list_skills()`

List all available skills with descriptions, resources, and scripts.

**Note:** With the enhanced system prompt, this tool is optional since all metadata is pre-loaded.

### 2. `load_skill(name)`

Load the full instructions for a specific skill.

```python
# Agent calls this when a skill is relevant
result = await load_skill(ctx, "arxiv-search")
```

### 3. `read_skill_resource(skill_name, resource_name)`

Read additional resource files (FORMS.md, REFERENCE.md, etc.).

```python
# Agent loads resources only when needed
result = await read_skill_resource(ctx, "pdf-processing", "FORMS.md")
```

### 4. `run_skill_script(skill_name, script_name, args)`

Execute a skill script with command-line arguments.

```python
# Agent executes scripts with arguments
result = await run_skill_script(
    ctx,
    "arxiv-search",
    "arxiv_search",
    ["machine learning", "--max-papers", "5"]
)
```

## System Prompt

The `SkillsToolset` automatically injects skill instructions into the agent's system prompt via the `get_instructions()` method. This includes:

- All skill metadata (name + description) for discovery
- Instructions on how to use skill tools effectively

This follows Anthropic's approach where all metadata is pre-loaded, enabling agents to select skills without calling `list_skills()`.

The automatic injection happens when you add the toolset to an agent - no additional decorator is needed.

## Security considerations

We strongly recommend that you use Skills only from trusted sources: those you created yourself or obtained from trusted sources. Skills provide AI Agents with new capabilities through instructions and code, and while this makes them powerful, it also means a malicious Skill can direct agents to invoke tools or execute code in ways that don't match the Skill's stated purpose.

> If you must use a Skill from an untrusted or unknown source, exercise extreme caution and thoroughly audit it before use. Depending on what access agents have when executing the Skill, malicious Skills could lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized system access, or other security risks.
