# Worker Component Addition - End-to-End Integration Test
#
# This script validates the complete workflow of adding the worker component
# to an existing Aegis Stack project. It tests:
# - Project generation
# - Worker component addition
# - Redis auto-dependency resolution
# - Shared file regeneration (health checks, dashboard cards)
# - Code quality validation
# - Docker service configuration
#
# Usage:
#   ./tests/scripts/test_worker_addition_workflow.sh
#
# Requirements:
#   - aegis CLI installed (uv run aegis or .venv/bin/aegis)
#   - Docker and Docker Compose (for service validation)
#   - uv package manager

set -e  # Exit on first error
