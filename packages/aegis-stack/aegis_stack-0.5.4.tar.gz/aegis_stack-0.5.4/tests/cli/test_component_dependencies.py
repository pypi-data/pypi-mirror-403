"""
Component Dependency Validation Tests for Aegis Stack CLI.

This module tests the component dependency resolution system to ensure:
1. Hard dependencies are automatically included
2. Dependency conflicts are properly detected
3. Component specifications are correctly applied
4. Generated projects have the right dependencies

Tests the core logic in aegis.core.dependency_resolver and ensures
component combinations work as expected.
