"""
Stack Generation Matrix Tests for Aegis Stack CLI.

This module tests all valid component combinations to ensure every possible
stack configuration generates successfully and produces valid project structures.

Test Matrix:
1. base                    (backend + frontend only)
2. base + redis           (adds Redis infrastructure)
3. base + scheduler       (includes Redis + APScheduler)
4. base + worker          (includes Redis + arq workers)
5. base + worker + scheduler (full processing stack)

Each combination must:
- Generate without errors
- Create correct file structure
- Include proper dependencies
- Generate valid Docker configuration
- Pass basic validation checks
