"""
Application constants.

This module contains truly immutable values that never change across environments.
For environment-dependent configuration, see app.core.config.

Following 12-Factor App principles:
- Constants = code (version controlled, immutable across deployments)
- Configuration = environment (varies between dev/staging/production)
