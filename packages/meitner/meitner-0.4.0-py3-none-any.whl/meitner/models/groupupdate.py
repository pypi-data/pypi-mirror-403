One recommended approach is to not include the Mentor type when creating or updating groups via the API, allowing school administrators to manually configure the Mentor type in Meitner as needed. When updating a group, you can preserve existing types by reading the current group state first and only modifying the specific types your integration manages (e.g., Class, Childcare).
