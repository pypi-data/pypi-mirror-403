# PyCodium

PyCodium is a free and open-source Python IDE built with [Reflex](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex), [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) (via [PyTauri](https://github.com/pytauri/pytauri)) and the [Monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor) editor.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This project is in an early stage of development and not in a usable state yet.
> It is intended to be a proof of concept for a Python IDE that runs in the browser.

You can run it with the following command:

```shell
uvx pycodium
```
