  Tests for the dm-cache device mapper target.
  dm-cache improves performance by caching data from a slow origin device
  (e.g., HDD) on a faster cache device (e.g., SSD).

  Tests include:
    - Cache device creation and removal
    - Writethrough and writeback modes
    - Cache statistics
    - I/O operations on cached devices
    - SMQ policy testing
