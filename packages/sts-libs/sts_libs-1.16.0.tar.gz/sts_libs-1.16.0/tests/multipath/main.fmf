summary: Test multipath device functionality
description: |
  Tests for multipath device management using the multipath_device fixture.

  Multipath devices are created using LIO loopback targets with fileio backstore.
  Multiple loopback targets share a single backstore to simulate multiple paths
  to the same storage device.

  Tests include:
    - Multipath device creation and properties
    - Path status and state verification
    - I/O operations (read/write)
    - Service interaction (multipathd)
