    Placeholder for unimplemented Git-centric commands.

    New patch-centric workflow commands not yet implemented.

    - ho-prod + ho-patch/patch-name branches
    - Patches/patch-name/ directory structure
    - releases/X.Y.Z-stage.txt → rc → production workflow
    - PatchManager integration via repo.patch_manager
