Modern development workflow for PostgreSQL databases with automatic code generation, semantic versioning, and production-ready deployment system.

---

## 📖 What is half-orm-dev?

`half-orm-dev` provides a complete development lifecycle for database-driven applications:

- **Git-centric workflow**: Patches stored in Git branches with semantic versioning
- **Test-Driven Development**: **Automatic validation** - tests run before integration, patches blocked if tests fail
- **Code generation**: Python classes auto-generated from schema changes
- **Safe deployments**: Sequential releases with automatic backups and validation
- **Team collaboration**: Distributed locks, branch management, conflict prevention
- **Cloud-friendly**: No superuser privileges required (works on AWS RDS, Azure, GCP)

Perfect for teams managing evolving PostgreSQL schemas with Python applications.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧪 Systematic Test Validation (Core Safety Feature)

**Tests run automatically before patch integration and block merges if they fail.**

```bash
# When you merge a patch, half-orm-dev:
git checkout ho-patch/123-feature
half_orm dev patch merge

# Behind the scenes:
# 1. Creates temporary validation branch
# 2. Merges ALL patches in release context
# 3. Runs pytest automatically
# 4. ✅ If PASS → merges into release, status → "staged"
# 5. ❌ If FAIL → nothing committed, temp branch deleted
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Catch integration issues early
- ✅ Prevent regressions automatically
- ✅ Only validated code reaches production
- ✅ Full release context testing (all patches together)

**Cannot be disabled** - it's a core safety feature.

### 🔧 Development Workflow

- **Patch-based development**: Isolated branches for each database change
- **Automatic code generation**: half-orm Python classes from schema
- **Complete testing**: Apply patches with full release context
- **Conflict detection**: Distributed locks prevent concurrent modifications

### 📦 Release Management

- **Semantic versioning**: patch/minor/major increments
- **Sequential promotion**: stage → rc → production workflow
- **Release candidates**: RC validation before production
- **Branch cleanup**: Automatic deletion after promotion

### 🚀 Production

- **Safe upgrades**: Automatic database backups before changes
- **Incremental deployment**: Apply releases sequentially
- **Version tracking**: Complete release history
- **Cloud-compatible**: No superuser privileges required

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** required
- **PostgreSQL 12+** recommended
- **Git** for version control

### Install

```bash
pip install half-orm-dev
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
half_orm dev --help
```

---

## 📖 Quick Start

### Initialize New Project

```bash
# Create project with database
half_orm dev init myproject --database mydb
cd myproject
```

### Clone Existing Project

```bash
# Clone from Git
half_orm dev clone https://github.com/user/project.git
cd project
```

### Basic Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create a release (integration branch)
half_orm dev release create minor  # Creates ho-release/0.1.0

# 2. Create a patch
half_orm dev patch create 1-users
# → Creates ho-patch/1-users branch
# → Auto-added to 0.1.0-patches.toml as "candidate"

# 3. Add schema changes
echo "CREATE TABLE users (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    username TEXT NOT NULL
);" > Patches/1-users/01_users.sql

# 4. Apply patch (generates Python code)
half_orm dev patch apply
# → Restores database from production state
# → Applies SQL patches
# → Generates Python classes (mydb/public/user.py)

# 5. Write tests (TDD approach)
cat > tests/public/user/test_user_logic.py << 'EOF'
from mydb.public.user import User

def test_user_creation():
    """Test user creation business logic."""
    user = User(username='alice').ho_insert()
    assert user['username'] == 'alice'
    assert user['id'] is not None
EOF

# 6. Run tests locally
pytest

# 7. Commit your work
git add .
git commit -m "Add users table with tests"

# 8. Merge patch - AUTOMATIC VALIDATION!
git checkout ho-patch/1-users
half_orm dev patch merge
# → Creates temp validation branch
# → Runs pytest automatically
# → If tests pass: merges into ho-release/0.1.0, status → "staged"
# → If tests fail: aborts, nothing committed

# 9. Promote to production
half_orm dev release promote rc    # Optional: create release candidate
half_orm dev release promote prod  # Merge to ho-prod + create tag
```

## 💻 Core Workflow

### Branch Strategy

```
ho-prod (main production branch)
│
├── ho-release/0.17.0 (integration branch, deleted after prod)
│   ├── ho-patch/6-feature-x    (temporary, deleted after merge)
│   ├── ho-patch/7-bugfix-y     (temporary, deleted after merge)
│   └── ho-patch/8-auth-z       (temporary, deleted after merge)
│
└── ho-release/0.18.0 (next version in parallel)
    └── ho-patch/10-new-api     (temporary, deleted after merge)
```

**Branch Types:**
- **ho-prod**: Stable production branch (source of truth)
- **ho-release/X.Y.Z**: Integration branches (temporary)
- **ho-patch/ID**: Patch development branches (temporary)

### Release Files

```
.hop/releases/
├── 0.17.0-patches.toml    # Development (mutable: candidate/staged status)
├── 0.17.0-rc1.txt         # Release candidate snapshot (immutable)
├── 0.17.0.txt             # Production snapshot (immutable)
└── 0.18.0-patches.toml    # Next version in progress
```

**Patch States:**
1. **candidate**: In development (`"patch-id" = "candidate"` in TOML)
2. **staged**: Integrated, awaiting promotion (`"patch-id" = "staged"` in TOML)
3. **released**: Deployed to production (in `X.Y.Z.txt` snapshot)

## 📖 Command Reference

### Init & Clone

```bash
# Create new project
half_orm dev init <package_name> --database <db_name>

# Clone existing project
half_orm dev clone <git_origin>
```

### Patch Commands

```bash
# Create new patch (must be on ho-release/* branch)
half_orm dev patch create <patch_id>

## 🎯 Example: Team Collaboration

```bash
# Integration Manager: Create release
half_orm dev release create minor  # Creates ho-release/0.17.0

# Developer A: Work on feature
git checkout ho-release/0.17.0
half_orm dev patch create 456-dashboard
# ... develop and test ...
git checkout ho-patch/456-dashboard
half_orm dev patch merge  # Tests run automatically
# → Status: "staged" in 0.17.0-patches.toml

# Developer B: Sync and create patch
git checkout ho-release/0.17.0
git pull origin ho-release/0.17.0  # Get A's changes
half_orm dev patch create 789-reports
# ... develop and test ...
git merge origin/ho-release/0.17.0  # Sync again
git checkout ho-patch/789-reports
half_orm dev patch merge
# → Tests run with BOTH 456 + 789 together!
# → Both validated in full release context
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Development
✅ **DO:**
- Write tests FIRST (TDD approach)
- Run `pytest` locally before `patch merge`
- Use descriptive patch IDs: `123-add-user-authentication`
- Keep patches focused (one feature per patch)
- Test patches thoroughly

❌ **DON'T:**
- Skip writing tests (validation will fail anyway)
- Mix multiple features in one patch
- Bypass test validation (it's there for safety)
- Modify files outside your patch directory

### Release Management
✅ **DO:**
- Trust the automatic test validation system
- Test RC thoroughly before promoting to production
- Use semantic versioning consistently
- Review test failures carefully before retrying

❌ **DON'T:**
- Skip RC validation
- Force promote without fixing issues
- Bypass test validation
- Ignore test failures

### Production Deployment
✅ **DO:**
- Always run `update` first to check available releases
- Use `--dry-run` to preview changes
- Verify backups exist before upgrade
- Verify all tests passed in RC before promoting

❌ **DON'T:**
- Deploy without testing in RC first
- Skip backup verification
- Promote to production if RC tests failed
- Apply patches directly without releases

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Must be on ho-release/* branch"
```bash
# Create release or switch to release branch
half_orm dev release create minor
# or
git checkout ho-release/0.17.0
```

### Error: "Must be on ho-patch/* branch"

```bash
# Solution: Create or switch to patch branch
# First ensure you're on ho-release/*
git checkout ho-release/0.17.0
half_orm dev patch create <patch_id>
# or
git checkout ho-patch/<patch_id>
```

### Error: "Patch not found in candidates file"

```bash
# Solution: Patch must be created from ho-release/* branch
# to be automatically added to candidates
git checkout ho-release/0.17.0
half_orm dev patch create <patch_id>
```

### Error: "Repository is not clean"

```bash
# Solution: Commit or stash changes
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
# or
git stash
```

### Error: "Repository not synced with origin"

```bash
# This should not happen - commands handle git operations automatically
# If it does occur:
git pull origin ho-prod
```

### Error: "No stage releases found"

```bash
# Solution: Prepare a release first
half_orm dev release new patch
```

### Error: "Active RC exists"

```bash
# Cannot promote different version while RC exists
# Solution: Promote current RC to production first
half_orm dev release promote prod

# Then promote your stage
half_orm dev release promote rc
```

### Error: "Tests failed for patch integration"
```bash
# Fix tests or code, then retry
half_orm dev patch apply  # Test locally first
pytest  # Verify tests pass

# Fix issues
vim Patches/123-feature/01_schema.sql
vim tests/test_feature.py

# Try again
git checkout ho-patch/123-feature
half_orm dev patch merge  # Tests will run again
```

### Error: "Repository is not clean"
```bash
# Commit or stash changes
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
# or
git stash
```
