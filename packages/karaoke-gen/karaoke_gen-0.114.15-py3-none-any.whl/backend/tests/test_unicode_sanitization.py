"""
Comprehensive tests for Unicode and special character handling.

This test file verifies that artist/title with Unicode characters (curly quotes,
em dashes, non-ASCII characters) are properly sanitized throughout the codebase
to prevent:
1. HTTP header encoding failures (Content-Disposition, email subjects)
2. API query failures (Google Drive)
3. Filename encoding issues (Modal API, filesystem)

The root cause was job d49efab1 which had title "Mama Says (You Can't Back Down)"
with a curly apostrophe (U+2019) that caused the audio separation to fail because
the Modal API couldn't handle the non-latin-1 character in HTTP headers.
