```

### Releases

You can download a release from our [releases](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-security-oss/cis/gitlabcis/-/releases) page.

### Install

There's a number of ways to download the scanner. Please see them below:

#### Pypi

Install `gitlabcis` from pypi.org:

```sh
pip install gitlabcis
```

#### GitLab

Install `gitlabcis` from the [package registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-security-oss/cis/gitlabcis/-/packages):

```sh
pip install gitlabcis --index-url https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/57279821/packages/pypi/simple
```

If you haven't already done so, you will need to add the below to your `.pypirc` file.

```ini
[gitlab]
repository = https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/57279821/packages/pypi
username = __token__
password = <your personal access token>
```

Install `gitlabcis` from source via clone/fork, or our [releases page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-security-oss/cis/gitlabcis/-/releases)

```sh

## CIS GitLab Benchmark Explained

The follow section was taken from the published benchmark.

### Overview

All CIS Benchmarks focus on technical configuration settings used to maintain and/or increase the security of the addressed technology, and they should be used in conjunction with other essential cyber hygiene tasks like:

* Monitoring the base operating system for vulnerabilities and quickly updating with the latest security patches
* Monitoring applications and libraries for vulnerabilities and quickly updating with the latest security patches

In the end, the CIS Benchmarks are designed as a key component of a comprehensive cybersecurity program.

This document provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for securing the Software Supply Chain. To obtain the latest version of this guide, please visit [www.cisecurity.org](www.cisecurity.org). If you have questions, comments, or have identified ways to improve this guide, please write to us at [support@cisecurity.org](mailto:support@cisecurity.org).

**Special Note**: The set of configuration files mentioned anywhere throughout this benchmark document may vary according to the deployment tool and the platform. Any reference to a configuration file should be modified according to the actual configuration files used on the specific deployment.

### Intended Audience

This document is intended for DevOps and application security administrators, security specialists, auditors, help desk, and platform deployment personnel who plan to develop, deploy, assess, or secure solutions to build and deploy software updates through automated means of DevOps pipelines.

### Consensus Guidance

This CIS Benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of a global community of subject matter experts. The process combines real world experience with data-based information to create technology specific guidance to assist users to secure their environments. Consensus participants provide perspective from a diverse set of backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and compliance, security research, operations, government, and legal. Each CIS Benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase occurs during initial Benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts convene to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the Benchmark. This discussion occurs until consensus has been reached on Benchmark recommendations. The second phase begins after the Benchmark has been published. During this phase, all feedback provided by the Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for incorporation in the Benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus process, please visit the [CIS Workbench](https://workbench.cisecurity.org/).

### Recommendation Definitions

The following defines the various components included in a CIS recommendation as applicable. If any of the components are not applicable it will be noted or the component will not be included in the recommendation.

#### Title

Concise description for the recommendation's intended configuration.

#### Assessment Status

An assessment status is included for every recommendation. The assessment status indicates whether the given recommendation can be automated or requires manual steps to implement. Both statuses are equally important and are determined and supported as defined below:

#### Automated

Represents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control can be fully automated and validated to a `pass`/`fail` state. Recommendations will include the necessary information to implement automation.

#### Manual

Represents recommendations for which assessment of a technical control cannot be fully automated and requires all or some manual steps to validate that the configured state is set as expected. The expected state can vary depending on the environment.

#### Profile

A collection of recommendations for securing a technology or a supporting platform. Most benchmarks include at least a Level 1 and Level 2 Profile. Level 2 extends Level 1 recommendations and is not a standalone profile. The Profile Definitions section in the benchmark provides the definitions as they pertain to the recommendations included for the technology.

#### Description

Detailed information pertaining to the setting with which the recommendation is concerned. In some cases, the description will include the recommended value. Rationale Statement Detailed reasoning for the recommendation to provide the user a clear and concise understanding on the importance of the recommendation.

#### Impact Statement

Any security, functionality, or operational consequences that can result from following the recommendation.

#### Audit Procedure

Systematic instructions for determining if the target system complies with the recommendation.

#### Remediation Procedure

Systematic instructions for applying recommendations to the target system to bring it into compliance according to the recommendation.

#### Default Value

Default value for the given setting in this recommendation, if known. If not known, either not configured or not defined will be applied.

#### References

Additional documentation relative to the recommendation.

#### CIS Critical Security Controls® (CIS Controls®)

The mapping between a recommendation and the CIS Controls is organized by CIS Controls version, Safeguard, and Implementation Group (IG). The Benchmark in its entirety addresses the CIS Controls safeguards of (v7) “5.1 - Establish Secure Configurations” and (v8) '4.1 - Establish and Maintain a Secure Configuration Process” so individual recommendations will not be mapped to these safeguards.

#### Additional Information

Supplementary information that does not correspond to any other field but may be useful to the user.

### Profile Definitions

The following configuration profiles are defined by this Benchmark:

#### Level 1

Items in this profile intend to:

* be practical and prudent;
* provide a clear security benefit; and
* not inhibit the utility of the technology beyond acceptable means.

#### Level 2

This profile extends the "Level 1 - Domain Controller" profile. Items in this profile exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:

* are intended for environments or use cases where security is paramount
* acts as defense in depth measure
* may negatively inhibit the utility or performance of the technology

```sh
--no-ssl-verify
```

* By `default` this is set to `False`, meaning that we verify SSL certificates in both REST & GraphQL API calls.

-g GROUP_ID
--implementation-groups GROUP_ID
```

* By `default`, _all_ implementation groups are included in a scan.

#### Omit Skipped results

If you wish to exclude `SKIP` results from your output, use either of the following options:

```sh
-os
--omit-skipped
```

* By `default`, this is set to `False` (include skipped)
