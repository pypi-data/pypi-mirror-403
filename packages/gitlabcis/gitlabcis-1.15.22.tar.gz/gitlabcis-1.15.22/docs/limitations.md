# Limitations

We cannot fully automate the audit of a control, as it's either not fully confident or simply unfeasible. Below is a list of all limitations within `gitlabcis`.

We are actively attempting to enhance GitLab by either developing features or providing ideas for features, see: #39+ for tracking.

## General

- The `gitlabcis` tool does support instances & groups but does not support all controls currently. This is on-going and can be tracked in: &2+
- When the `gitlabcis` tool audits a `project` it only look at the `project` level, not take into hierarchical settings or permissions.
  - i.e. If you selected "Require approval from CODEOWNERS" at a group level and _not_ at the project level, you would `FAIL` the [1.1.7 - code_changes_require_code_owners](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-security-oss/cis/gitlabcis/-/blob/main/gitlabcis/recommendations/source_code/code_changes/code_changes_require_code_owners.yml) control.
- For any controls that require _admin_ level permissions a `SKIP` will be returned if the token does not have sufficient permission.
  - This also includes any control that requires non-admin elevated permissions which the token used, does not have.

## Benchmark Controls

| id | name | Limitation |
| ---- | ------ | ------------ |
| 1.1.4 | code_approval_dismissals | For `Group` input types, we require a change upstream on the `python-gitlab` dependency (ref: [MR approval settings Group Level #3165](https://github.com/python-gitlab/python-gitlab/issues/3165)). |
| 1.1.5 | code_dismissal_restrictions | Trusted users cannot be automatically checked. The control will `PASS` for projects that have protected branches, and `FAIL` if none are set. For `Group` input types, we require a change upstream on the `python-gitlab` dependency (ref: [Protected Branches Group Level #3164](https://github.com/python-gitlab/python-gitlab/issues/3164)). |
| 1.1.7 | code_changes_require_code_owners | The recommendation is only set for the `default` branch. This function does not iterate over all protected branches. Additionally, if a user removes the protected status of their default branch, then creates a new protected branch. Only the protected branch is checked, skipping the default. For `Group` input types, we require a change upstream on the `python-gitlab` dependency (ref: [Protected Branches Group Level #3164](https://github.com/python-gitlab/python-gitlab/issues/3164)). |
| 1.1.11 | comments_resolved_before_merging | For `Group` input types, the following [feature request](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/534608) needs to be created, then an upstream change created in `python-gitlab` in order for us to assess this. |
| 1.1.12 | commits_must_be_signed_before_merging | This control will return a `SKIP` if the [push rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/group_push_rules/) feature is not enabled. |
| 1.1.14 | branch_protections_for_admins | Requires admin permissions to get a `PASS`/`FAIL` - additionally, gitlab.com `FAIL`'s this, because we allow group owners to manage default branch protections (by design). |
| 1.1.15 | merging_restrictions | This requires to iterate over every protected branch, which for large projects takes quite some time. We cannot distinguish between trusted & untrusted users, as the recommendation states these must be trusted users, this function does not `FAIL` based on this. For `Group` input types, we require a change upstream on the `python-gitlab` dependency (ref: [Protected Branches Group Level #3164](https://github.com/python-gitlab/python-gitlab/issues/3164)). |
| 1.1.16 | ensure_force_push_is_denied | For `Group` input types, we require a change upstream on the `python-gitlab` dependency (ref: [Protected Branches Group Level #3164](https://github.com/python-gitlab/python-gitlab/issues/3164)). |
| 1.1.17 | deny_branch_deletions | For `Group` input types, we require a change upstream on the `python-gitlab` dependency (ref: [Protected Branches Group Level #3164](https://github.com/python-gitlab/python-gitlab/issues/3164)). |
| 1.1.19 | audit_branch_protections | Ensuring that any changes to branch protections are audited requires reviewing logs generated on the instance. Enabling/disabling audit_events isn't toggle-able and if the automation could query the `protected_branch_updated` events, it still would not concretely answer if the events were audited. |
| 1.2.1 | public_repos_have_security_file | The control will `SKIP` if the repository is not public. If the `SECURITY.md` file does not exist in the root directory of the default branch in the repository, it will `FAIL`. |
| 1.2.3 | limit_repo_deletions | If a project that contains 1,000+ members as a result of nested-group permissions, this control will take a long time to finish. As such, it will return `SKIP` until a solution is found. |
| 1.2.4 | limit_issue_deletions | If a project that contains 1,000+ members as a result of nested-group permissions, this control will take a long time to finish. As such, it will return `SKIP` until a solution is found. |
| 1.2.5 | trace_forks | We can't account and trace forks programatically. This control will `SKIP` if forks are found, otherwise `PASS`. |
| 1.2.6 | track_project_visibility_status | `SKIP` by default as we cannot ascertain the relevant information programatically. |
| 1.3.1 | review_and_remove_inactive_users | Running this benchmark as a gitlab.com admin will take a considerable amount of time. |
| 1.3.3 | minimum_number_of_admins | Running this benchmark as a gitlab.com admin will take a considerable amount of time. |
| 1.3.6 | limit_user_registration_domain | `SKIP` by default as we cannot ascertain the relevant information programatically. |
| 1.3.8 | strict_permissions_for_repo | Running this benchmark as a gitlab.com admin will take a considerable amount of time. |

| 1.4.1 | admin_approval_for_app_installs | This control will _not_ review scopes on authorized applications, as this requires manual verification |
| 1.4.2 | stale_app_reviews | This control will look at the previous `20` pipeline jobs, and check for `dependency_scanning` in the name. This occurs when Dependency Scanning is enabled for a project, if found it will `PASS` else returns a `FAIL` |
| 1.4.3 | least_privilege_app_permissions | <ul><li>For `Instance` types, a `SKIP` will be presented.</li><li>For `Project` types, If a project has `integrations` then this check will `SKIP` to require manual verification, otherwise if none were found return a `PASS`</li></ul> |
