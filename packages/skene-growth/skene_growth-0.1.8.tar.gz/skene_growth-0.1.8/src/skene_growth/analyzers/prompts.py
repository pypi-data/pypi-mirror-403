# Tech Stack Detection Prompt
TECH_STACK_PROMPT = """
Analyze the provided files (configuration files and source files) to detect the technology stack used in this project.

IMPORTANT: When determining the **Language**, prioritize actual source files over configuration files.
For example, if you see Python source files (.py) but only a package.json config file,
the language is Python, not JavaScript.
Look at file extensions and code syntax in source files to determine the primary language.

Focus on identifying:
1. **Framework**: The primary web/app framework (e.g., Next.js, FastAPI, Rails, Django)
2. **Language**: The main programming language (e.g., Python, TypeScript, Go) - DETERMINE FROM SOURCE FILES,
   not just config files
3. **Database**: Database technology if detectable (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
4. **Auth**: Authentication method or library (e.g., JWT, OAuth, NextAuth, Clerk)
5. **Deployment**: Deployment platform or method (e.g., Vercel, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Netlify)
6. **Package Manager**: Package manager used (e.g., npm, yarn, poetry, cargo)
7. **Services**: Third-party services and integrations used in the project

For **Services**, look for dependencies and environment variables indicating:
- Payment processors: Stripe, PayPal, Paddle, LemonSqueezy
- Email services: SendGrid, Mailgun, Postmark, Resend
- Analytics: Segment, Mixpanel, Amplitude, PostHog
- Monitoring: Sentry, DataDog, New Relic, LogRocket
- Communication: Twilio, Plivo
- Search: Algolia, Elasticsearch, Typesense
- Storage: AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Cloudinary
- Other SaaS integrations

Return your analysis as JSON matching this structure:
{
    "framework": "string or null",
    "language": "string (required)",
    "database": "string or null",
    "auth": "string or null",
    "deployment": "string or null",
    "package_manager": "string or null",
    "services": ["array of service names"]
}

Be conservative - only include values you're confident about. Use null for uncertain fields.
Return an empty array for services if none are detected.
"""

# Current Growth Features Detection Prompt
GROWTH_FEATURES_PROMPT = """
Analyze the provided source files and identify current features with growth potential.

A "current growth feature" is an existing feature in the codebase that:
- Enables viral growth (sharing, invitations, referrals)

"""

# Revenue Leakage Detection Prompt
REVENUE_LEAKAGE_PROMPT = """
Analyze the provided source files and identify potential revenue leakage issues.

Revenue leakage occurs when a product or service could be generating more revenue but isn't due to:
- Missing or weak monetization strategies (free features that should be paid)
- Inadequate pricing tiers or upgrade prompts
- Features that could be monetized but are given away for free
- Missing usage limits or restrictions on free tiers
- Lack of conversion funnels from free to paid
- Missing payment processing or subscription management
- Overly generous free tiers that reduce paid conversions
- Missing premium features or add-ons
- Inefficient pricing models

For each revenue leakage issue you identify, provide:
1. **issue**: Clear description of the revenue leakage problem
2. **file_path**: File where this is detected (if applicable, null otherwise)

"""

# Industry Classification Prompt
INDUSTRY_PROMPT = """
Analyze the provided documentation and package metadata files to classify the industry/market vertical.

Your task is to determine what **market vertical or domain** this product serves (NOT the technology stack).

Focus on identifying:
1. **primary**: A concise industry vertical label. Common examples:
   - DevTools (developer tools, SDKs, APIs, infrastructure)
   - FinTech (payments, banking, investing, accounting)
   - E-commerce (online retail, marketplaces, product catalogs)
   - Healthcare (medical, wellness, patient management)
   - EdTech (learning, training, educational content)
   - Marketing (advertising, analytics, CRM, email marketing)
   - HR (recruiting, payroll, employee management)
   - Security (authentication, compliance, monitoring)
   - Productivity (collaboration, project management, notes)
   - Data/Analytics (business intelligence, data pipelines, visualization)
   - Media/Entertainment (streaming, content, gaming)
   - Real Estate (property, rentals, listings)
   - Logistics (shipping, supply chain, inventory)
   - Other (specify if none of the above fit)

2. **secondary**: 0-5 supporting tags for sub-verticals or business model nuance:
   - Business model: B2B, B2C, B2B2C
   - Delivery model: SaaS, On-premise, Hybrid, API-first
   - Market position: Enterprise, SMB, Startup, Consumer
   - Distribution: Marketplace, OpenSource, Freemium

3. **confidence**: A score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating how confident you are.
   - 0.8-1.0: Clear product/domain signals in README or docs
   - 0.5-0.7: Some signals but could be interpreted differently
   - 0.0-0.4: Minimal or ambiguous signals

4. **evidence**: 2-5 short bullet points citing **specific signals** from the files:
   - Quote key phrases from README (e.g., "README mentions 'team collaboration tool'")
   - Reference package description or keywords
   - Note integration names that hint at domain (e.g., "Integrates with Shopify suggests E-commerce")
   - Mention user-facing docs headings or terminology

**Signals to look for (high to low priority):**
- README product description, tagline, "what it does", "who it's for"
- package.json description/keywords, pyproject.toml description/classifiers
- Integration names (Stripe → payments, Shopify → e-commerce, HIPAA → healthcare)
- Domain vocabulary in documentation

**IMPORTANT - Uncertainty rule:**
If the repository lacks clear product/domain signals (e.g., generic library, no README, unclear purpose),
return:
- primary: null
- secondary: []
- confidence: low (< 0.3)
- evidence: explain what signals were missing or why classification is uncertain

Return your analysis as JSON:
{
    "primary": "string or null",
    "secondary": ["array of tags"],
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "evidence": ["array of short evidence strings"]
}

Be conservative - it's better to return null with low confidence than to guess incorrectly.
"""

# Product Overview Extraction Prompt
PRODUCT_OVERVIEW_PROMPT = """
Analyze the provided documentation files to extract product overview information.
