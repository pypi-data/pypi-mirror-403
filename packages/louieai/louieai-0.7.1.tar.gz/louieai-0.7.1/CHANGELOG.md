## dev

### Added
- None.

### Changed
- None.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- Targeted pandas 2.x/3.x compatibility tests in CI.

### Changed
- pandas requirement updated to `>=2,<4` (supports 2.x and 3.x).
- Dropped direct `pytz` dependency; now only transitive via pandas 2.x.

### Fixed
- Secret detection CI no longer rewrites `.secrets.baseline` on check-only runs.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **Distributed tracing**: W3C `traceparent` propagation for correlating requests with OpenTelemetry
  - Automatic OTel context propagation when available
  - Session-level trace ID for correlation when OTel is not configured
  - `Cursor.new()` children inherit parent trace ID for session-wide correlation
  - Zero configuration required - works automatically

### Changed
- `LouieClient._get_headers()` now accepts `session_trace_id` and `traceparent` parameters
- All HTTP methods (`add_cell`, `upload_*`, streaming) propagate trace context

## [0.6.2] - 2025-12-22

### Added
- **Dthread naming + folders**: Thread name/folder are supported across create, add, list, and upload helpers, plus notebook cursor flows.
- **Thread lookup by name**: `get_thread_by_name()` resolves threads by name via the unified identifier endpoint.
- **Anonymous desktop auth (optional)**: Anonymous token flow for local desktop servers via `/auth/anonymous`, with `anonymous`/`token` client options.

### Changed
- **Thread listing**: `list_threads()` now parses both `data` and `items` response shapes and supports client-side folder filtering.
- 🔥 **Breaking**: `server` and `anonymous_token` were removed; use `graphistry_server` and `token` instead.
- **Secret detection**: CI now uses a temp baseline to avoid rewriting `.secrets.baseline` timestamps when nothing changes.

## [0.6.1] - 2025-11-06

### Added
- **Table AI overrides**: `LouieClient.add_cell()` and `UploadClient.upload_dataframe()` accept structured Table AI overrides and automatically route to the singleshot endpoint when any override is supplied, including callable shorthand support and dataframe hydration for override responses.
- **`TableAIOverrides` dataclass**: Public helper (exported from `louieai`) with JSON-safe normalization to simplify setting semantic/evidence/ask modes and options.

### Changed
- `LouieClient.__call__()` forwards additional keyword arguments to ensure override kwargs work with the callable interface.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-09-25

### Added
- **Upload support**: Complete DataFrame, image, and binary file upload functionality
  - New methods: `upload_dataframe()`, `upload_image()`, `upload_binary()`
  - Natural notebook interface via `lui(df, "analyze this")` or `lui("query", df)`
  - Support for multiple formats: parquet, csv, json, jsonl, arrow
  - Automatic format detection and serialization
  - Configurable parsing options per format
- **JSONL format**: Explicit support for JSONL (newline-delimited JSON) format
- **Image analysis**: Upload and analyze images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, etc.)
- **Binary file support**: Upload PDFs, Office docs, and other binary files
- **Streaming display**: Enhanced streaming support for uploads in notebooks

### Changed
- Moved `nbclient` from main to dev/docs dependencies (not needed at runtime)
- Removed unnecessary `_upload.py` exclusion from ruff formatter

### Fixed
- Fixed JSONL parsing for concatenated JSON responses from server
- Fixed context manager syntax errors in upload implementation
- Resolved all linting and formatting issues in upload code

## [0.5.7] - 2025-08-05

### Fixed
- **Double display in Jupyter notebooks**: Fixed issue where responses were displayed twice when calling `lui("query")` in notebooks
  - Modified `_repr_html_` to show only session metadata instead of response content
  - Response content is now displayed only once via streaming or `_display()` method
  - Prevents duplicate display while maintaining useful session information

## [0.5.6] - 2025-08-04

### Fixed
- **Cursor properties**: `lui.df`, `lui.text`, and `lui.g` now correctly return the **last** (most recent) result instead of the first
  - This matches user expectations where the most recent result is typically most relevant
  - Affects both `Cursor` and `ResponseProxy` classes

### Added
- **Thread management documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation for `.url` and `.thread_id` properties
- **Thread Management section** in notebook API docs with examples for sharing analysis results

### Improved
- **Security documentation**: Enhanced credential storage guidelines for AI assistants

## [0.5.5] - 2025-08-04

### Fixed
- **Vibes investigation notebook**: Fixed remaining table references to use underscored `o365_management_activity_flat_tcook` instead of hyphenated names
- **Notebook output cleaning**: Enhanced to handle `display_data` output type in addition to `execute_result`

## [0.5.4] - 2025-08-04

### Fixed
- **Vibes investigation notebook**: Fixed Databricks table references to use correct `o365_management_activity_flat_tcook` table name instead of incorrect hyphenated names

## [0.5.3] - 2025-08-04

### Fixed
- **DatabricksAgent empty text elements**: ResponseProxy.elements now properly checks content/text/value fields
- **Notebook output cleaning**: Fixed to redact sensitive data instead of removing entire outputs
- **Pre-commit hook**: Now recognizes `****` as legitimate redaction pattern
