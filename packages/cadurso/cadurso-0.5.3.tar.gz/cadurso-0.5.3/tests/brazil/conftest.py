"""
A Cadurso-based authorization system set in the Brazil (1985) universe.

The system is modelled as an RBAC-like system, where actors (e.g., Sam Lowry, Jill Layton) have roles
(e.g., BUREAUCRAT, CITIZEN). Each role has a set of permissions (e.g., READ_FORM, INSPECT, ENTER_DEPARTMENT), as encoded
in the rules of the Cadurso instance.

The fixtures in this module represent the characters, locations, and permissions in the Brazil universe.
