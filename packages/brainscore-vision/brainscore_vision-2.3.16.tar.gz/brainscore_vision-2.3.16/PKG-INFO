Brain-Score is a platform to evaluate computational models of brain function 
on their match to brain measurements in primate vision. 
The intent of Brain-Score is to adopt many (ideally all) the experimental benchmarks in the field
for the purpose of model testing, falsification, and comparison.
To that end, Brain-Score operationalizes experimental data into quantitative benchmarks 
that any model candidate following the [`BrainModel`](brainscore_vision/model_interface.py) interface can be scored on.

Note that you can only access a limited set of public benchmarks when running locally. To score a model on all benchmarks, submit it via the [brain-score.org website](http://www.brain-score.org).

See the [documentation](https://brain-score.readthedocs.io) for more details, e.g. for submitting a [model](https://brain-score.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/model_tutorial.html) or [benchmark](https://brain-score.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/benchmark_tutorial.html) to Brain-Score. For a step-by-step walkthrough on submitting models to the Brain-Score website, see these [web tutorials](https://www.brain-score.org/tutorial/).

See these [code examples](https://github.com/brain-score/vision/blob/master/examples) on scoring models, retrieving data, using and defining benchmarks and metrics.
These [previous examples](https://github.com/brain-score/candidate_models/blob/master/examples/score-model.ipynb) might be helpful, but their usage has been deprecated after the 2.0 update.

Brain-Score is made by and for the community.

## Local installation

You will need Python = 3.11 and pip >= 18.1.

`pip install brainscore-vision`

Test if the installation is successful by scoring a model on a public benchmark:

```python
import brainscore_vision

benchmark = brainscore_vision.load_benchmark('MajajHong2015public.IT-pls')
model = my_model()
score = benchmark(model)

# >  <xarray.Score ()>
# >  array(0.07637264)
# >  Attributes:
# >  Attributes:
# >      error:                 <xarray.Score ()>\narray(0.00548197)
# >      raw:                   <xarray.Score ()>\narray(0.22545106)\nAttributes:\...
# >      ceiling:               <xarray.DataArray ()>\narray(0.81579938)\nAttribut...
# >      model_identifier:      my-model
# >      benchmark_identifier:  MajajHong2015public.IT-pls
```

Some steps may take minutes because data has to be downloaded during first-time use.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>`ValueError: did not find HDF5 headers` during netcdf4 installation</summary>
pip seems to fail properly setting up the HDF5_DIR required by netcdf4.
Use conda: `conda install netcdf4`
</details>

<details>
<summary>repeated runs of a benchmark / model do not change the outcome even though code was changed</summary>
results (scores, activations) are cached on disk using https://github.com/mschrimpf/result_caching.
Delete the corresponding file or directory to clear the cache.
</details>


## CI environment

Add CI related build commands to `test_setup.sh`. The script is executed in CI environment for unittests.
