# Django Framework Skills

## Django Patterns

### Models
- Use explicit field definitions
- Add appropriate indexes
- Use model methods for business logic
- Follow Django naming conventions

### Views
- Prefer class-based views for complex logic
- Use function-based views for simple cases
- Keep views thin, move logic to models/services

### URLs
- Use descriptive URL patterns
- Group related URLs in apps
- Version APIs in URL path

### Testing
- Use Django TestCase for database tests
- Use SimpleTestCase for non-database tests
- Use factories (factory_boy) for test data
