# degr33

 degr33 is a **read-only Linux command and tool explanation assistant**.

 It helps you understand **what a command or tool would do BEFORE you run it**.
 degr33  **never executes commands** and **never simulates execution**.

This makes it safe for:
- Security environments
- Kali / hardened Linux systems
- Auditing & learning
- Beginners who want to avoid breaking their system

---

## 🔒 Safety Guarantees

- ❌ Never executes commands  
- ❌ Never simulates execution
