# {
#     "city": "Beijing",
#     "temperature": 22,
#     "condition": "sunny",
#     "humidity": 45,
#     "wind_speed": 10
# }

# Get weather for Shanghai

2. Register the skill as a tool in your MCP server:

```python
from mcp.server.mcpserver import MCPServer
from aliyun_mcp_skill import get_weather

# Create MCP server
mcp = MCPServer("Aliyun Weather Server")

# Register weather tool
@mcp.tool()
def weather(city: str) -> dict:
    """Get weather information for a city"""
    return get_weather(city)

# Run server
mcp.run(transport="streamable-http", json_response=True)
```

3. Connect your Aliyun LLM application to the MCP server
