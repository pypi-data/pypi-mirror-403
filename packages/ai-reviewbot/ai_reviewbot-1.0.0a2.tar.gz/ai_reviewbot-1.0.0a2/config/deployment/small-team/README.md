# Small Team Configuration

**Status:** 🚧 Coming Soon

---

## About This Configuration

This will be a configuration optimized for:
- **Small teams** (2-10 developers)
- **Hybrid LLM approach** (cost + quality balanced)
- **Moderate budget** (~$10-30/month)
- **All 3 agents** (Security, Architecture, QA)

---

## What Will Be Here

```yaml
# Configuration for small team deployment
# - Primary: Anthropic Claude (quality)
# - Fallback: Google Gemini (cost)
# - Strategy: Complexity-based routing
# - Estimated: ~500 reviews/month
```

---

## Expected Features

When implemented:
- Intelligent LLM routing (simple → Gemini, complex → Claude)
- Full agent suite (security, architecture, quality)
- Repository context awareness
- Team customization options
- Cost tracking and optimization

---

## Timeline

This configuration will be added when:
- [ ] Multi-LLM router supports fallback
- [ ] All 3 agents are implemented
- [ ] Repository context module works
- [ ] Cost tracking is functional
