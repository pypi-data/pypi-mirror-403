## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- Add support for passing `ssl` parameter to the `fetch` and `download` functions to
  allow customization of SSL context for HTTPS requests.

### Changed

- Dropped support for Python 3.9 due to EOl.
- Use `aioresponses` library for testing.

## [0.1.3] - 2025-02-20

### Changed

- Change the timeout from session to request level. This allows for more granular
  control over the timeout for each request.

## [0.1.2] - 2025-02-18

### Changed

- More robust handling of starting and stopping threads by lazy generation of a
  dedicated thread for the library and making `_AsyncLoopThread` a singleton. This can
  avoid issues that might arise from using TinyRetriever with other libraries that also
  use threads such as `shapely`.

## [0.1.1] - 2025-02-12

### Added

- Add support for passing single URL/key to both `fetch` and `download` functions. This
  makes using the function easier when there's just one query to be made. The result is
  returned as a single item too.

### Changed

- Check the validity of the input `request_kwargs` in `fetch` function based on the
  acceptable args for `aiohttp.ClientSession.request` method.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-02-11

Initial release.
