## 🌍 Key Features

- **Inference-Centric Analysis**: Quantifies CO₂ emissions, energy use, and water impact from real-time inference
- **Cross-Hardware Profiling**: Supports A100, T4, RTX, GTX, and CPU-only setups
- **Model-Agnostic Framework**: Runs LLMs, ViTs, audio models, and traditional ML
- **ESS Metric**: Introduces the Environmental Sustainability Score for normalized emissions comparison
- **Quantization Insights**: Analyzes FP16 and INT8 savings for sustainable deployment
- **Frequency-Aware Monitoring**: Adjusts sampling dynamically for short and long-running workloads
- **Lightweight and Extensible**: Runs on mobile, edge, and low-resource devices

## 📊 What It Measures

### ✅ CO₂ Emissions  
- Based on PUE, regional carbon intensity, and power consumption  
- Adaptive to cloud, desktop, or edge scenarios

### ✅ Energy Usage  
- Instantaneous power profiling via NVIDIA-SMI, `psutil`, or RAPL  
- Sample-level granularity for each inference configuration

### ✅ Water Footprint  
- Derived from power-to-water coefficients by tier (e.g., datacenter vs. mobile)

### ✅ Environmental Sustainability Score (ESS) Metric  

$$\text{ESS} = \frac{\text{Effective Parameters (M)}}{\text{CO₂ (g)}}$$

- A normalized environmental efficiency metric for sustainable ML comparisons

## 🛠️ Configuration Template

```yaml
project: "ml_sustainability_benchmark"

models:
  - name: "facebook/opt-2.7b"
    task: "text"
    quantization:
      enabled: true
      method: "dynamic"
      target_dtype: "int8"

## 🧪 Research Insights

### Quantization Efficiency

```text
INT8 models show up to 74% higher ESS than FP32 equivalents.
```

### Hardware Utilization

```text
A100 performs worst in ESS when underutilized; RTX/T4 yield better emissions-per-parameter for single-batch workloads.
```

### Task-Wise Trends

```text
Traditional models like SVC or Logistic Regression incur high ECEP due to small parameter count, despite low energy.
```
