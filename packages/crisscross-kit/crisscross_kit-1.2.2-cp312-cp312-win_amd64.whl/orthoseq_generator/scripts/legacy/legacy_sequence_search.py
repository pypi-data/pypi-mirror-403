"""

Purpose:
    Load a previously saved subset of 7-mer sequence pairs and their off-target energies,
    build the interaction graph, run the iterative vertex-cover heuristic to extract an
    independent set (orthogonal sequences), and save the results.

Main Steps:
    1. Fix the random seed for reproducibility.
    2. Load the pickled subset data (sequences, indices, off-target energies).
    3. Build the off-target interaction graph using a specified energy cutoff.
    4. Run the iterative vertex-cover algorithm to find the minimum cover.
    5. Compute the independent set (orthogonal sequences) as the complement of the cover.
    6. Save the independent sequences to a text file.
