# DeepWork Job Specification: [job_name]

A `job.yml` file defines a complete multi-step workflow that AI agents can execute. Each job breaks down a complex task into reviewable steps with clear inputs and outputs.

## Required Fields

### Top-Level Metadata

```yaml
name: job_name                    # lowercase, underscores only
version: "1.0.0"                  # semantic versioning
summary: "Brief description"      # max 200 characters
description: |                    # detailed multi-line explanation
  [Explain what this workflow does, why it exists,
  what outputs it produces, and who should use it]
```

### Changelog

```yaml
changelog:
  - version: "1.0.0"
    changes: "Initial job creation"
  - version: "1.1.0"
    changes: "Added quality validation hooks"
```

### Steps Array

```yaml
steps:
  - id: step_id                   # unique, lowercase_underscores
    name: "Human Readable Name"
    description: "What this step accomplishes"
    instructions_file: steps/step_id.md
    inputs:
      # User-provided inputs:
      - name: param_name
        description: "What the user provides"
      # File inputs from previous steps:
      - file: output.md
        from_step: previous_step_id
    outputs:
      - competitive_research/competitors_list.md           # descriptive path
      - competitive_research/[competitor_name]/research.md # parameterized path
      # With doc spec reference:
      - file: competitive_research/final_report.md
        doc_spec: .deepwork/doc_specs/report_type.md
    dependencies:
      - previous_step_id          # steps that must complete first
```

## Optional Fields

### Exposed Steps

```yaml
steps:
  - id: learn
    exposed: true                 # Makes step available without running dependencies
```

### Quality Hooks

```yaml
steps:
  - id: step_id
    hooks:
      after_agent:
        # Inline prompt for quality validation:
        - prompt: |
            Verify the output meets criteria:
            1. [Criterion 1]
            2. [Criterion 2]
            If ALL criteria are met, include `<promise>...</promise>`.
        # External prompt file:
        - prompt_file: hooks/quality_check.md
        # Script for programmatic validation:
        - script: hooks/run_tests.sh
```

### Stop Hooks (Legacy)

```yaml
steps:
  - id: step_id
    stop_hooks:
      - prompt: "Validation prompt..."
      - prompt_file: hooks/check.md
      - script: hooks/validate.sh
```

## Validation Rules

1. **No circular dependencies**: Step A cannot depend on Step B if Step B depends on Step A
2. **File inputs require dependencies**: If a step uses `from_step: X`, then X must be in its dependencies
3. **Unique step IDs**: No two steps can have the same id
4. **Valid file paths**: Output paths must not contain invalid characters and should be in the main repo (not dot-directories)
5. **Instructions files exist**: Each `instructions_file` path should have a corresponding file created
