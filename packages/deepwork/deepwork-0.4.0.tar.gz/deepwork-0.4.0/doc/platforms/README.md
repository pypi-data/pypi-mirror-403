# Platform Documentation

This directory contains internal documentation about how different AI CLI platforms behave in ways that matter for DeepWork's hook system and adapter implementations.

## Purpose

These documents capture:

1. **Hook System Behavior** - Input/output formats, blocking mechanisms, event types
2. **Environment Variables** - What each platform provides to hook scripts
3. **Quirks and Edge Cases** - Platform-specific behaviors discovered during development
4. **Learnings** - Insights gained from implementing and testing adapters

## Adding Learnings

**IMPORTANT**: As you work on platform-specific code, document learnings here!

When you discover something about how a platform behaves that isn't obvious from official documentation, add it to the relevant platform's folder. Examples:

- "Gemini CLI's AfterAgent hook doesn't receive transcript_path when the session was resumed"
- "Claude Code's Stop hook JSON must have `decision: block` exactly, not `deny`"
- "Exit code 2 blocks in both platforms but stderr handling differs"
