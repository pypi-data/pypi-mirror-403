# deepwork_rules

**Multi-step workflow**: Creates file-change rules that enforce guidelines during AI sessions. Use when automating documentation sync or code review triggers.

> **NOTE**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step, tell the user which command to run next.

Manages rules that automatically trigger when certain files change during an AI agent session.
Rules help ensure that code changes follow team guidelines, documentation is updated,
and architectural decisions are respected.

IMPORTANT: Rules are evaluated at the "Stop" hook, which fires when an agent finishes its turn.
This includes when sub-agents complete their work. Rules are NOT evaluated immediately after
each file edit - they batch up and run once at the end of the agent's response cycle.
- Command action rules: Execute their command (e.g., `uv sync`) when the agent stops
- Prompt action rules: Display instructions to the agent, blocking until addressed

Rules are stored as individual markdown files with YAML frontmatter in the `.deepwork/rules/`
directory. Each rule file specifies:
- Detection mode: trigger/safety, set (bidirectional), or pair (directional)
- Patterns: Glob patterns for matching files, with optional variable capture
- Action type: prompt (default) to show instructions, or command to run a shell command
- Instructions: Markdown content describing what the agent should do

Example use cases:
- Update installation docs when configuration files change
- Require security review when authentication code is modified
- Ensure API documentation stays in sync with API code
- Enforce source/test file pairing
- Auto-run `uv sync` when pyproject.toml changes (command action)


## Available Steps

1. **define** - Creates a rule file that triggers when specified files change. Use when setting up documentation sync, code review requirements, or automated commands.
   Command: `/deepwork_rules:define`

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Parse any text following `/deepwork_rules` to determine user intent:
- "define" or related terms → start at `/deepwork_rules:define`

### Step 2: Direct User to Starting Step

Tell the user which command to run:
```
/deepwork_rules:define
```

### Step 3: Guide Through Workflow

After each step completes, tell the user the next command to run until workflow is complete.

### Handling Ambiguous Intent

If user intent is unclear:
- Present available steps as numbered options
- Ask user to select the starting point
