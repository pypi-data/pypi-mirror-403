# add_platform

**Multi-step workflow**: Adds a new AI platform to DeepWork with adapter, templates, and tests. Use when integrating Cursor, Windsurf, or other AI coding tools.

> **NOTE**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step, tell the user which command to run next.

A workflow for adding support for a new AI platform (like Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) to DeepWork.

This job guides you through four phases:
1. **Research**: Capture the platform's CLI configuration and hooks system documentation
2. **Add Capabilities**: Update the job schema and adapters with any new hook events
3. **Implement**: Create the platform adapter, templates, tests (100% coverage), and README updates
4. **Verify**: Ensure installation works correctly and produces expected files

The workflow ensures consistency across all supported platforms and maintains
comprehensive test coverage for new functionality.

**Important Notes**:
- Only hooks available on slash command definitions should be captured
- Each existing adapter must be updated when new hooks are added (typically with null values)
- Tests must achieve 100% coverage for any new functionality
- Installation verification confirms the platform integrates correctly with existing jobs


## Available Steps

1. **research** - Captures CLI configuration and hooks system documentation for the new platform. Use when starting platform integration.
   Command: `/add_platform:research`
2. **add_capabilities** - Updates job schema and adapters with any new hook events the platform supports. Use after research to extend DeepWork's hook system. (requires: research)
   Command: `/add_platform:add_capabilities`
3. **implement** - Creates platform adapter, templates, tests with 100% coverage, and README documentation. Use after adding hook capabilities. (requires: research, add_capabilities)
   Command: `/add_platform:implement`
4. **verify** - Sets up platform directories and verifies deepwork install works correctly. Use after implementation to confirm integration. (requires: implement)
   Command: `/add_platform:verify`

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Parse any text following `/add_platform` to determine user intent:
- "research" or related terms → start at `/add_platform:research`
- "add_capabilities" or related terms → start at `/add_platform:add_capabilities`
- "implement" or related terms → start at `/add_platform:implement`
- "verify" or related terms → start at `/add_platform:verify`

### Step 2: Direct User to Starting Step

Tell the user which command to run:
```
/add_platform:research
```

### Step 3: Guide Through Workflow

After each step completes, tell the user the next command to run until workflow is complete.

### Handling Ambiguous Intent

If user intent is unclear:
- Present available steps as numbered options
- Ask user to select the starting point
