**Multi-step workflow**: Updates DeepWork standard jobs in src/ and syncs to installed locations. Use when modifying deepwork_jobs or deepwork_rules.

> **NOTE**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step, tell the user which command to run next.

A workflow for maintaining standard jobs bundled with DeepWork. Standard jobs
(like `deepwork_jobs` and `deepwork_rules`) are source-controlled in
`src/deepwork/standard_jobs/` and must be edited there—never in `.deepwork/jobs/`
or `.claude/commands/` directly.

This job guides you through:
1. Identifying which standard job(s) to update from conversation context
2. Making changes in the correct source location (`src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job_name]/`)
3. Running `deepwork install` to propagate changes to `.deepwork/` and command directories
4. Verifying the sync completed successfully

Use this job whenever you need to modify job.yml files, step instructions, or hooks
for any standard job in the DeepWork repository.


## Available Steps

1. **job** - Edits standard job source files in src/ and runs deepwork install to sync changes. Use when updating job.yml or step instructions.
   Command: `/update:job`

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Parse any text following `/update` to determine user intent:
- "job" or related terms → start at `/update:job`

### Step 2: Direct User to Starting Step

Tell the user which command to run:
```
/update:job
```

### Step 3: Guide Through Workflow

After each step completes, tell the user the next command to run until workflow is complete.

### Handling Ambiguous Intent

If user intent is unclear:
- Present available steps as numbered options
- Ask user to select the starting point
