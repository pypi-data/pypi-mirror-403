"""Hook command for DeepWork CLI.

This command runs hook scripts, allowing hooks to use the `deepwork` CLI
instead of `python -m deepwork.hooks.*`, which works regardless of how
deepwork was installed (flake, pipx, uv, etc.).

Usage:
    deepwork hook rules_check
    deepwork hook <hook_name>

This is meant to be called from hook wrapper scripts (claude_hook.sh, gemini_hook.sh).

    Run a DeepWork hook by name.

    This command imports and runs the hook module from deepwork.hooks.{hook_name}.
    The hook receives stdin input and outputs to stdout, following the hook protocol.
