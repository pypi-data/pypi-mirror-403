# Manual Test: Command Action

This rule automatically appends a timestamped log entry when the
test file is edited. No agent prompt is shown - the command runs
automatically.

## This tests:

The command action feature where rules can execute shell commands
instead of prompting the agent. The command should be idempotent.
