# Run Tests

## Objective

Run the project's test suite and fix any failing tests until all tests pass.

## Task

Execute the test suite for the project and iteratively fix any failures until all tests pass.

### Process

1. **Pull latest code from the branch**
   - Run `git pull` to fetch and merge any changes from the remote
   - If there are merge conflicts, resolve them before proceeding
   - This ensures you're testing against the latest code

2. **Detect or use the test command**
   - If a test command was provided, use that
   - Otherwise, auto-detect the project type and determine the appropriate test command:
     - Python: `pytest`, `python -m pytest`, `uv run pytest`
     - Node.js: `npm test`, `yarn test`, `bun test`
     - Go: `go test ./...`
     - Rust: `cargo test`
     - Check `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod` for hints

3. **Run the tests**
   - Execute the test command
   - Capture the output

4. **Analyze failures**
   - If tests pass, proceed to output
   - If tests fail, analyze the failure messages
   - Identify the root cause of each failure

5. **Fix failing tests**
   - Make the necessary code changes to fix failures
   - This may involve fixing bugs in implementation code or updating tests
   - Re-run tests after each fix

6. **Iterate until passing**
   - Continue the fix/test cycle until all tests pass

## Quality Criteria

- Latest code was pulled from the branch
- Test command was correctly identified or used from input
- All tests are now passing
- When all criteria are met, include `<promise>✓ Quality Criteria Met</promise>` in your response

## Context

This step runs after code review. Tests must pass before proceeding to lint and commit. This ensures code quality and prevents broken code from being committed. If tests fail due to issues introduced by the code review fixes, iterate on the fixes until tests pass.
