# Manual Hook/Rule Tests Reference

This document contains the test matrix and reference information for all manual hook/rule tests.

## Why Sub-Agents?

**All tests MUST be run in sub-agents, not by the main agent directly.**

This approach works because:
1. Sub-agents run in isolated contexts where file changes can be detected
2. The Stop hook **automatically** evaluates rules when the sub-agent completes
3. The main agent can **observe** whether hooks fired - it must NOT manually run the rules_check command
4. Using a fast model (e.g., haiku) keeps test iterations quick and cheap

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER edit test files from the main agent** - always spawn a sub-agent to make edits
2. **NEVER manually run the rules_check command** - hooks fire automatically when sub-agents return
3. **OBSERVE the hook behavior** - when a sub-agent returns, watch for blocking prompts or command outputs
4. **REVERT between tests** - use `git checkout -- manual_tests/` to reset the test files

## Parallel vs Serial Execution

**"Should NOT fire" tests CAN run in parallel:**
- These tests edit BOTH trigger AND safety files (completing the rule requirements)
- Even though `git status` shows changes from all sub-agents, each rule only matches its own scoped file patterns
- Since the safety file is edited, the rule won't fire regardless of other changes
- No cross-contamination possible
- **Revert all changes after these tests complete** before running "should fire" tests

**"Should fire" tests MUST run serially with git reverts between each:**
- These tests deliberately edit ONLY the trigger file (not the safety)
- If multiple run in parallel, sub-agent A's hook will see changes from sub-agent B
- This causes cross-contamination: A gets blocked by rules triggered by B's changes
- Run one at a time, reverting between each test

## Test Matrix

Each test has two cases: one where the rule SHOULD fire, and one where it should NOT.

| Test | Should Fire | Should NOT Fire | Rule Name |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Trigger/Safety** | Edit `.py` only | Edit `.py` AND `_doc.md` | Manual Test: Trigger Safety |
| **Set Mode** | Edit `_source.py` only | Edit `_source.py` AND `_test.py` | Manual Test: Set Mode |
| **Pair Mode** | Edit `_trigger.py` only | Edit `_trigger.py` AND `_expected.md` | Manual Test: Pair Mode |
| **Pair Mode (reverse)** | -- | Edit `_expected.md` only (should NOT fire) | Manual Test: Pair Mode |
| **Command Action** | Edit `.txt` -> log appended | -- (always runs) | Manual Test: Command Action |
| **Multi Safety** | Edit `.py` only | Edit `.py` AND any safety file | Manual Test: Multi Safety |
| **Infinite Block Prompt** | Edit `.py` (always blocks) | Provide `<promise>` tag | Manual Test: Infinite Block Prompt |
| **Infinite Block Command** | Edit `.py` (command fails) | Provide `<promise>` tag | Manual Test: Infinite Block Command |
| **Created Mode** | Create NEW `.yml` file | Modify EXISTING `.yml` file | Manual Test: Created Mode |

## Test Folders

| Folder | Rule Type | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `test_trigger_safety_mode/` | Trigger/Safety | Basic conditional: fires unless safety file also edited |
| `test_set_mode/` | Set (Bidirectional) | Files must change together (either direction) |
| `test_pair_mode/` | Pair (Directional) | One-way: trigger requires expected, but not vice versa |
| `test_command_action/` | Command Action | Automatically runs command on file change |
| `test_multi_safety/` | Multiple Safety | Fires unless ANY of the safety files also edited |
| `test_infinite_block_prompt/` | Infinite Block (Prompt) | Always blocks with prompt; only promise can bypass |
| `test_infinite_block_command/` | Infinite Block (Command) | Command always fails; tests if promise skips command |
| `test_created_mode/` | Created (New Files Only) | Fires ONLY when NEW files are created, not when existing modified |
