MANUAL TEST: Pair Mode (Directional Correspondence)

=== WHAT THIS TESTS ===
Tests the "pair" detection mode where there's a ONE-WAY relationship:
- This file is the TRIGGER
- test_pair_mode_expected.md is the EXPECTED file
- When THIS file changes, the expected file MUST also change
- But the expected file CAN change independently (no rule fires)

=== TEST CASE 1: Rule SHOULD fire ===
1. Edit this file (add a comment below the marker)
2. Do NOT edit test_pair_mode_expected.md
3. Run: echo '{}' | python -m deepwork.hooks.rules_check
4. Expected: "Manual Test: Pair Mode" appears in output

=== TEST CASE 2: Rule should NOT fire (both edited) ===
1. Edit this file (add a comment below the marker)
2. ALSO edit test_pair_mode_expected.md
3. Run: echo '{}' | python -m deepwork.hooks.rules_check
4. Expected: "Manual Test: Pair Mode" does NOT appear

=== TEST CASE 3: Rule should NOT fire (expected only) ===
1. Do NOT edit this file
2. Edit ONLY test_pair_mode_expected.md
3. Run: echo '{}' | python -m deepwork.hooks.rules_check
4. Expected: "Manual Test: Pair Mode" does NOT appear
   (This verifies the ONE-WAY nature of pair mode)

=== RULE LOCATION ===
