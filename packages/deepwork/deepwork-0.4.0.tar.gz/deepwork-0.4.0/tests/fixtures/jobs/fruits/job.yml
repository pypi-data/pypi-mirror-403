description: |
  A simple, deterministic job for CI testing of the DeepWork framework.

  This job takes a list of mixed items (fruits and non-fruits) and:
  1. Identifies which items are fruits
  2. Classifies those fruits into categories (citrus, berries, tropical, etc.)

  This workflow is designed to produce predictable, verifiable outputs
  making it ideal for automated testing.
