## Development Setup

### Setting Up direnv (Optional but Recommended)

direnv automatically loads the Nix environment when you `cd` into the project directory:

```bash
# Install direnv (if not already installed)
# On macOS with Homebrew:
brew install direnv

# On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):
apt-get install direnv

# On NixOS or with Nix:
nix-env -i direnv

# Add direnv hook to your shell
# For bash, add to ~/.bashrc:
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"

# For zsh, add to ~/.zshrc:
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"

# For fish, add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish:
direnv hook fish | source

# Restart your shell or source your rc file
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

Once direnv is set up, the environment will activate automatically when you enter the directory.

### Option 1: Using Nix Flakes (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using Nix flakes, which provides a fully reproducible development environment with all dependencies pre-configured.

#### Quick Start with direnv (Recommended)

If you have direnv installed, the entire development environment activates automatically when you `cd` into the project:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/deepwork/deepwork.git
cd deepwork

# Allow direnv (first time only)
direnv allow

# That's it! Everything is ready:
deepwork --help    # CLI works
pytest             # Tests work
ruff check src/    # Linting works
```

The `.envrc` file contains `use flake`, which tells direnv to load the Nix flake's development shell. This automatically:

1. Creates `.venv/` if it doesn't exist
2. Installs all dependencies via `uv sync --all-extras`
3. Adds `.venv/bin` to your PATH
4. Sets `PYTHONPATH` and `DEEPWORK_DEV=1`

Every time you `cd` into the directory, the environment is ready instantly (venv is reused, deps are cached).

#### Manual Flake Usage

If you don't use direnv, you can manually enter the development environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/deepwork/deepwork.git
cd deepwork

# Enter the Nix development environment
nix develop
```

#### What's Included

The Nix environment provides:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `deepwork` | CLI using your local source code (editable install) |
| `claude` | Claude Code CLI (built from source for version control) |
| `pytest` | Test runner with all plugins |
| `ruff` | Fast Python linter and formatter |
| `mypy` | Static type checker |
| `uv` | Python package manager |
| `python` | Python 3.11 interpreter |
| `update` | Updates claude-code and flake inputs |

#### CI Usage

For CI pipelines or scripts, use `nix develop --command`:

```bash
nix develop --command pytest
nix develop --command ruff check src/
nix develop --command mypy src/
```

#### Updating Development Dependencies

The Nix environment includes Claude Code built from source to ensure version control (the nixpkgs version can lag behind npm releases). Use the `update` command to keep dependencies current:

```bash
# In the dev shell - updates claude-code and flake inputs
update
```

To manually update Claude Code:

```bash
./nix/claude-code/update.sh
```

This fetches the latest version from npm, computes the necessary hashes using `prefetch-npm-deps`, and updates `package.nix` automatically.

A GitHub Action automatically checks for new Claude Code versions daily and creates PRs when updates are available.

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Without Nix)

If you prefer not to use Nix:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/deepwork/deepwork.git
cd deepwork

# Install uv if you don't have it (see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment and install all dependencies (including dev tools)
uv venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv sync --all-extras

# Set environment variables for development
export PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src:$PYTHONPATH"
export DEEPWORK_DEV=1
```

## Installing DeepWork Locally

The development version of DeepWork is installed automatically in **editable mode**, meaning changes to source code are reflected immediately without reinstalling.

### With Nix (Automatic)

If you're using the Nix development environment, DeepWork is already installed in editable mode. No additional steps needed.

### Without Nix (Manual)

If you set up manually, the `uv sync --all-extras` command installs DeepWork in editable mode automatically.

Alternatively, you can install explicitly:

```bash
# Using uv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Or using pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check that the deepwork command is available
deepwork --help

# Verify you're using the local development version
which deepwork  # Should point to .venv/bin/deepwork

# Check version
deepwork --version
```

## Testing Your Local Installation

To test your local DeepWork installation in a real project:

### 1. Create a Test Project

```bash
# Outside the deepwork directory
mkdir ~/test-deepwork-project
cd ~/test-deepwork-project
git init
```

### 2. Install DeepWork in the Test Project

Since you installed DeepWork in editable mode, the `deepwork` command uses your local development version:

```bash
# Run the install command
deepwork install --platform claude

# Verify installation
ls -la .deepwork/
ls -la .claude/
```

### 3. Test Your Changes

Any changes you make to the DeepWork source code will be immediately reflected:

```bash
# Make changes in ~/deepwork/src/deepwork/...
# Then test in your test project
deepwork install --platform claude

# Or test the CLI directly
deepwork --help
```

### 4. Test with Claude Code

If you have Claude Code installed, you can test the generated skills:

```bash
# In your test project
claude  # Start Claude Code

# Try the generated skills
/deepwork.define
```

## Running Tests

DeepWork has a comprehensive test suite with 568+ tests.

### Run All Tests

```bash
# In Nix environment (interactive or CI)
pytest

# Or using nix develop --command (CI-friendly, no interactive shell)
nix develop --command pytest

# Using uv run (without Nix)
uv run pytest
```

### Run Specific Test Types

```bash
# Unit tests only
pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Integration tests only
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/unit/core/test_parser.py -v

# Run a specific test function
pytest tests/unit/core/test_parser.py::test_parse_valid_job -v
```

### Test with Coverage

```bash
# Generate coverage report
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=deepwork --cov-report=html

# View coverage in browser

## Development Tips

### Quick Development Cycle

```bash
# In one terminal: Enter Nix development environment
nix develop

# In Nix environment: Watch tests
uv run pytest tests/unit/ --watch

# In another terminal: Make changes to src/deepwork/

# Tests automatically re-run on save
```

### Debugging

```bash
# Run tests with verbose output and stop on first failure
uv run pytest -vv -x

# Run tests with pdb debugger on failure
uv run pytest --pdb

# Add breakpoints in code
import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Time test execution
time uv run pytest tests/unit/

# Profile test execution
uv run pytest --profile
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: `deepwork` command not found
**With Nix**: Re-enter the development environment:
```bash
nix develop
# or if using direnv
direnv reload
```

**Without Nix**: Ensure venv is activated and dependencies synced:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync --all-extras
```

### Issue: Tests failing with import errors
**Solution**: This usually means dependencies aren't installed. Re-sync:
```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

### Issue: Changes not reflected
**Solution**: Verify editable install with uv:
```bash
uv pip list | grep deepwork
# Should show: deepwork (editable) with path to your local directory
```

### Issue: Nix environment not loading
**Solution**: Ensure Nix is installed with flakes enabled:
```bash
nix --version
# Add to ~/.config/nix/nix.conf if not already there:
# experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```

### Issue: Old venv causing conflicts
**Solution**: Remove and let Nix recreate it:
```bash
rm -rf .venv
nix develop  # Will recreate .venv automatically
```
