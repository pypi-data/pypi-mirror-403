MANUAL TEST: Set Mode (Bidirectional Correspondence)

=== WHAT THIS TESTS ===
Tests the "set" detection mode where files must change together:
- This source file and test_set_mode_test.py are in a "set"
- If EITHER file changes, the OTHER must also change
- This is BIDIRECTIONAL (works in both directions)

=== TEST CASE 1: Rule SHOULD fire ===
1. Edit this file (add a comment below the marker)
2. Do NOT edit test_set_mode_test.py
3. Run: echo '{}' | python -m deepwork.hooks.rules_check
4. Expected: "Manual Test: Set Mode" appears in output

=== TEST CASE 2: Rule should NOT fire ===
1. Edit this file (add a comment below the marker)
2. ALSO edit test_set_mode_test.py
3. Run: echo '{}' | python -m deepwork.hooks.rules_check
4. Expected: "Manual Test: Set Mode" does NOT appear

=== RULE LOCATION ===
