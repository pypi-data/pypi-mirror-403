MANUAL TEST: Command Action Rule

=== WHAT THIS TESTS ===
Tests the "command action" feature where a rule automatically
runs a shell command instead of prompting the agent.

=== HOW TO TRIGGER ===
Edit this file (add text, modify content, etc.)

=== EXPECTED BEHAVIOR ===
When this file is edited, the rule automatically runs a command
that appends a timestamped line to test_command_action_log.txt

The command is idempotent: running it multiple times produces
consistent results (a log entry is appended).

=== RULE LOCATION ===
.deepwork/rules/manual-test-command-action.md

=== LOG FILE ===
Check test_command_action_log.txt for command execution results.
