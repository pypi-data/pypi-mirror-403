# Project Context for deepwork_jobs

This is the source of truth for the `deepwork_jobs` standard job.

## Codebase Structure

- Source location: `src/deepwork/standard_jobs/deepwork_jobs/`
- Working copy: `.deepwork/jobs/deepwork_jobs/`
- Templates: `templates/` directory within each location

## Dual Location Maintenance

**Important**: This job exists in two locations that must be kept in sync:

1. **Source of truth**: `src/deepwork/standard_jobs/deepwork_jobs/`
   - This is where changes should be made first
   - Tracked in version control

2. **Working copy**: `.deepwork/jobs/deepwork_jobs/`
   - Must be updated after changes to source
   - Used by `deepwork sync` to generate commands

After making changes to the source, copy files to the working copy:
```bash
cp src/deepwork/standard_jobs/deepwork_jobs/job.yml .deepwork/jobs/deepwork_jobs/
cp src/deepwork/standard_jobs/deepwork_jobs/steps/*.md .deepwork/jobs/deepwork_jobs/steps/
cp -r src/deepwork/standard_jobs/deepwork_jobs/templates/* .deepwork/jobs/deepwork_jobs/templates/
```
