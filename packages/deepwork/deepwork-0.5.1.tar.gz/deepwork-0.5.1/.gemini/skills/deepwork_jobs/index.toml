**Multi-step workflow**: Creates and manages multi-step AI workflows. Use when defining, implementing, or improving DeepWork jobs.

> **NOTE**: Gemini CLI requires manual command invocation. After each step, tell the user which command to run next.

Core commands for managing DeepWork jobs. These commands help you define new multi-step
workflows and learn from running them.

The `define` command guides you through an interactive process to create a new job by
asking structured questions about your workflow, understanding each step's inputs and outputs,
and generating all necessary files.

The `learn` command reflects on conversations where DeepWork jobs were run, identifies
confusion or inefficiencies, and improves job instructions. It also captures bespoke
learnings specific to the current run into AGENTS.md files in the working folder.


## Available Steps

1. **define** - Creates a job.yml specification by gathering workflow requirements through structured questions. Use when starting a new multi-step workflow.
   Command: `/deepwork_jobs:define`
2. **review_job_spec** - Reviews job.yml against quality criteria using a sub-agent for unbiased validation. Use after defining a job specification. (requires: define)
   Command: `/deepwork_jobs:review_job_spec`
3. **implement** - Generates step instruction files and syncs slash commands from the job.yml specification. Use after job spec review passes. (requires: review_job_spec)
   Command: `/deepwork_jobs:implement`
4. **learn** - Analyzes conversation history to improve job instructions and capture learnings. Use after running a job to refine it.
   Command: `/deepwork_jobs:learn`

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Analyze Intent

Parse any text following `/deepwork_jobs` to determine user intent:
- "define" or related terms → start at `/deepwork_jobs:define`
- "review_job_spec" or related terms → start at `/deepwork_jobs:review_job_spec`
- "implement" or related terms → start at `/deepwork_jobs:implement`
- "learn" or related terms → start at `/deepwork_jobs:learn`

### Step 2: Direct User to Starting Step

Tell the user which command to run:
```
/deepwork_jobs:define
```

### Step 3: Guide Through Workflow

After each step completes, tell the user the next command to run until workflow is complete.

### Handling Ambiguous Intent

If user intent is unclear:
- Present available steps as numbered options
- Ask user to select the starting point
