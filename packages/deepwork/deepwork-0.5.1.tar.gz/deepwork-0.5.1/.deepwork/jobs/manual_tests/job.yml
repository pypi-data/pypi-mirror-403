description: |
  A workflow for running manual tests that validate DeepWork rules/hooks fire correctly.

  This job tests that rules fire when they should AND do not fire when they shouldn't.
  Each test is run in a SUB-AGENT (not the main agent) because:
  1. Sub-agents run in isolated contexts where file changes can be detected
  2. The Stop hook automatically evaluates rules when each sub-agent completes
  3. The main agent can observe whether hooks fired without triggering them manually

  CRITICAL: All tests MUST run in sub-agents. The main agent MUST NOT make the file
  edits itself - it spawns sub-agents to make edits, then observes whether the hooks
  fired automatically when those sub-agents returned.

  Sub-agent configuration:
  - All sub-agents should use `model: "haiku"` to minimize cost and latency
  - All sub-agents should use `max_turns: 5` to prevent hanging indefinitely

  Steps:
  1. reset - Ensure clean environment before testing (clears queue, reverts files)
  2. run_not_fire_tests - Run all "should NOT fire" tests in PARALLEL sub-agents (6 tests)
  3. run_fire_tests - Run all "should fire" tests in SERIAL sub-agents with resets between (6 tests)
  4. infinite_block_tests - Run infinite block tests in SERIAL (4 tests - both fire and not-fire)

  Reset procedure (see steps/reset.md):
  - Reset runs FIRST to ensure a clean environment before any tests
  - Each step also calls reset internally when needed (between tests, after completion)
  - Reset reverts git changes, removes created files, and clears the rules queue

  Test types covered:
  - Trigger/Safety mode
  - Set mode (bidirectional)
  - Pair mode (directional)
  - Command action
  - Multi safety
  - Infinite block (prompt and command) - in dedicated step
  - Created mode (new files only)

changelog:
  - version: "1.3.0"
    changes: "Add model/max_turns config for sub-agents; move infinite block tests to dedicated serial step; add reset step that runs first; verify queue empty for 'should NOT fire' tests"
  - version: "1.2.1"
    changes: "Fixed incomplete revert - now uses git reset HEAD to unstage files (rules_check stages with git add -A)"
  - version: "1.2.0"
    changes: "Added early termination on 2 test failures; emphasized mandatory file revert and queue clear after each step"
  - version: "1.1.0"
    changes: "Added rules queue clearing between tests to prevent anti-infinite-loop mechanism from blocking tests"
  - version: "1.0.0"
    changes: "Initial job creation - tests run in sub-agents to observe automatic hook firing"
