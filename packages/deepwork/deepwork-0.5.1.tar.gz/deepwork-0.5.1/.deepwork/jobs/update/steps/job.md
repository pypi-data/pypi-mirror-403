# Update Standard Job

## Objective

Edit standard job source files in `src/deepwork/standard_jobs/` and sync changes to installed locations.

## Task

When modifying a standard job in the DeepWork repository, this step ensures changes are made in the correct location and properly propagated.

### Important: Source of Truth

Standard jobs exist in THREE locations, but only ONE is the source of truth:

| Location | Purpose | Editable? |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| `src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job]/` | **Source of truth** | **YES** |
| `.deepwork/jobs/[job]/` | Installed copy | NO - overwritten by install |
| `.claude/commands/[job].[step].md` | Generated commands | NO - regenerated by sync |

**NEVER edit files in `.deepwork/jobs/` or `.claude/commands/` for standard jobs!**

### Process

#### 1. Identify the Standard Job to Update

From conversation context, determine:
- Which standard job needs updating (e.g., `deepwork_jobs`, `deepwork_rules`)
- What changes are needed (job.yml, step instructions, hooks, etc.)

Current standard jobs:
```bash
ls src/deepwork/standard_jobs/
```

#### 2. Make Changes in Source Location

```
src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job_name]/
├── job.yml              # Job definition
├── steps/               # Step instruction files
├── hooks/               # Hook scripts
└── templates/           # Templates
```

#### 3. Run DeepWork Install

```bash
deepwork install --platform claude
```

For Gemini: `deepwork install --platform gemini`

#### 4. Verify the Sync

```bash
# Verify job.yml
diff src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job_name]/job.yml .deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/job.yml

# Verify step files
diff -r src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job_name]/steps/ .deepwork/jobs/[job_name]/steps/

# Check commands regenerated
ls -la .claude/commands/[job_name].*.md
```

## Quality Criteria

- Changes made ONLY in `src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job_name]/`
- `deepwork install --platform claude` executed successfully
- Files in `.deepwork/jobs/` match source
- Command files regenerated
- When all criteria are met, include `<promise>✓ Quality Criteria Met</promise>`
