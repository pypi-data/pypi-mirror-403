summary: "Updates DeepWork standard jobs in src/ and syncs to installed locations. Use when modifying deepwork_jobs or deepwork_rules."
description: |
  A workflow for maintaining standard jobs bundled with DeepWork. Standard jobs
  (like `deepwork_jobs` and `deepwork_rules`) are source-controlled in
  `src/deepwork/standard_jobs/` and must be edited there—never in `.deepwork/jobs/`
  or `.claude/commands/` directly.

  This job guides you through:
  1. Identifying which standard job(s) to update from conversation context
  2. Making changes in the correct source location (`src/deepwork/standard_jobs/[job_name]/`)
  3. Running `deepwork install` to propagate changes to `.deepwork/` and command directories
  4. Verifying the sync completed successfully

  Use this job whenever you need to modify job.yml files, step instructions, or hooks
  for any standard job in the DeepWork repository.
