    Processes a property and converts it to a frontend configuration dictionary.

    This function takes a field name and property data, and converts them into a dictionary
    that represents the configuration for a frontend form control. It handles various types
    such as core types, arrays, dictionaries, and files.

    Args:
        field_name (str): The name of the field to be processed.
        property_data (PropertyData): The property data to be processed.

    Returns:
        dict[str, Any]: A dictionary representing the frontend configuration for the given property.

    Populates a frontend configuration dictionary with values.

    This function takes a frontend configuration dictionary and a dictionary of values,
    and populates the configuration with the corresponding values. It recursively processes
    nested controls to ensure all values are populated.

    Args:
        config (dict[str, Any]): The frontend configuration dictionary to be populated.
        values (dict[str, Any]): The dictionary of values to populate the configuration with.

    Extracts values from a response dictionary or list of dictionaries.

    This function processes a response to extract the relevant values. It checks if the response
    is a dictionary containing a 'rows' key and processes the rows to find the appropriate values.
    If the response is not in the expected format, it returns an empty dictionary.

    Args:
        response (dict[str, Any] | list[dict[str, Any]]): The response to extract values from.

    This function attempts to import a class by its name from various schema types.
    If the class is found, it converts it to a frontend configuration dictionary
    and returns it. If the class is not found, it returns an empty dictionary.

    Args:
        class_name (str): The name of the class to retrieve the default control for.

    Returns:
