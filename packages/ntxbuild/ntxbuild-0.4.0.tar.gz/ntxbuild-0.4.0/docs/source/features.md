# Project Features

## Basic NuttX Scripts Wrapper
- Supports the most used functions of the `tools/configure.sh` script on NuttX.
- Makefile build support
- Environemnt `clean` and `distclean`
- Menuconfig available and also kconfig options modification directly from command line
- Full Python API support

## Toolchain Management
- The toolchain module provides a quick way to download toolchains for supported architectures.
- Installed on home directory for general use when needed even outside `ntxbuild` CLI.
- Toolchains are organized by NuttX release and default to latest version.

## CMake Support
The use of Makefile is the default state of `ntxbuild`. To build using CMake, pass
`--use-cmake` to the `ntxbuild start` command. This will setup the directory to CMake
and Ninja generator.

Currently, CMake support uses the `build` directory for output and Ninja generator when invoked
from the CLI. Using the Python API allows more flexibility.

## Real-time Build Output
When building directly from NuttX, the user can see build output in real-time.
This tool keeps the output the same, as the user will see the logging output
with no buffering.

- Live progress display with proper ANSI colors
- No buffering for immediate feedback
- Preserves terminal control sequences

## Lightweight Workspace Copies
The API provides functions that assist in generating lightweight copies of the NuttX
workspace, which can be useful in CI environments.

See usage examples on {doc}`api_examples`.

- Excludes unnecessary files (.git, build artifacts, etc.)
- Configurable target directory
- Automatic cleanup

## Curses Support
Menuconfig works just as usual through this tool.

- Full support for interactive tools like menuconfig
- Proper terminal handling
- No broken interfaces

## To-Do

```{note}
Active feature tracking and new feature requests are now handled on the [project board](https://github.com/users/fdcavalcanti/projects/5).
