# BBBLB: BigBlueButton Load Balancer

BBBLB (BigBlueButton Load Balancer) is yet another load balancer for [BigBlueButton](https://bigbluebutton.org/). It is designed to provide a secure, scalable, and robust way to scale BBB beyond single-server installations, enabling organizations to distribute meetings across many BBB servers or offer managed BBB hosting services on shared hardware.

> :warning: BBBLB is not ready for production just yet unless you know how to fix bugs yourself. It works well enough, but APIs and features are not stable yet and upgrades may break things. If you are looking for a reliable solution that *just works*, better wait for the 1.0 release.
   


## Documentation

Documentation can be found at https://bbblb.readthedocs.io/  or in the `./docs/` folder. This is still a work in progress. Pull requests are very welcomed!


## Features

* **Multi-Tenancy:** Allow multiple front-end applications or customers to share the same BigBlueButton cluster while keeping their meetings and recordings strictly separated.
* **Advanced Loadbalancing:** Meetings are distributed based on current and predicted utilization, taking common usage patterns into account and avoiding the infamous ‘trampling herd’ problem.
* **Recording Management:** Recordings are transferred from the BBB servers to central storage via a simple and robust post_publish script. No special configuration, ssh transfers or shared network file system necessary.
* **Callback Relay:** Callbacks registered for a meeting are properly relayed between the back-end BBB server and the front-end application with a robust retry-mechanism.
* **Management API:** BBBLB offers its own API and command line tool to fetch health information, manage tenants, servers or recordings, or perform maintenance tasks.
* **Easy to deploy:** At least easier than most other BigBlueButton Load Balancer implementations.

## Architecture

BBBLB acts as a central API gateway, intelligently routing API requests and distributing meetings across a scaleable pool of BigBlueButton instances.
