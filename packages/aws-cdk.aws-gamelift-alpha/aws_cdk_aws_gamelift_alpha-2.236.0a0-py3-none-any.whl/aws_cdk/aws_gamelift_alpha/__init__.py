[Amazon GameLift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-intro.html) is a service used
to deploy, operate, and scale dedicated, low-cost servers in the cloud for session-based multiplayer games. Built
on AWS global computing infrastructure, GameLift helps deliver high-performance, high-reliability game servers
while dynamically scaling your resource usage to meet worldwide player demand.

GameLift is composed of three main components:

* GameLift FlexMatch which is a customizable matchmaking service for
  multiplayer games. With FlexMatch, you can
  build a custom set of rules that defines what a multiplayer match looks like
  for your game, and determines how to
  evaluate and select compatible players for each match. You can also customize
  key aspects of the matchmaking
  process to fit your game, including fine-tuning the matching algorithm.
* GameLift hosting for custom or realtime servers which helps you deploy,
  operate, and scale dedicated game servers. It regulates the resources needed to
  host games, finds available game servers to host new game sessions, and puts
  players into games.
* GameLift FleetIQ to optimize the use of low-cost Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
  (Amazon EC2) Spot Instances for cloud-based game hosting. With GameLift
  FleetIQ, you can work directly with your hosting resources in Amazon EC2 and
  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling while taking advantage of GameLift optimizations to
  deliver inexpensive, resilient game hosting for your players

This module is part of the [AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk) project. It allows you to define components for your matchmaking
configuration or game server fleet management system.

## GameLift FlexMatch

### Defining a Matchmaking configuration

FlexMatch is available both as a GameLift game hosting solution (including
Realtime Servers) and as a standalone matchmaking service. To set up a
FlexMatch matchmaker to process matchmaking requests, you have to create a
matchmaking configuration based on a RuleSet.

More details about matchmaking ruleSet are covered [below](#matchmaking-ruleset).

There is two types of Matchmaking configuration:

Through a game session queue system to let FlexMatch forms matches and uses the specified GameLift queue to start a game session for the match.

```python
# queue: gamelift.GameSessionQueue
# rule_set: gamelift.MatchmakingRuleSet


gamelift.QueuedMatchmakingConfiguration(self, "QueuedMatchmakingConfiguration",
    matchmaking_configuration_name="test-queued-config-name",
    game_session_queues=[queue],
    rule_set=rule_set
)
```

Or through a standalone version to let FlexMatch forms matches and returns match information in an event.

```python
# rule_set: gamelift.MatchmakingRuleSet


gamelift.StandaloneMatchmakingConfiguration(self, "StandaloneMatchmaking",
    matchmaking_configuration_name="test-standalone-config-name",
    rule_set=rule_set
)
```

More details about Game session queue are covered [below](#game-session-queue).

### Matchmaking RuleSet

Every FlexMatch matchmaker must have a rule set. The rule set determines the
two key elements of a match: your game's team structure and size, and how to
group players together for the best possible match.

For example, a rule set might describe a match like this: Create a match with
two teams of four to eight players each, one team is the cowboy and the other
team the aliens. A team can have novice and experienced players, but the
average skill of the two teams must be within 10 points of each other. If no
match is made after 30 seconds, gradually relax the skill requirements.

```python
gamelift.MatchmakingRuleSet(self, "RuleSet",
    matchmaking_rule_set_name="my-test-ruleset",
    content=gamelift.RuleSetContent.from_json_file(path.join(__dirname, "my-ruleset", "ruleset.json"))
)
```

### FlexMatch Monitoring

You can monitor GameLift FlexMatch activity for matchmaking configurations and
matchmaking rules using Amazon CloudWatch. These statistics are used to provide
a historical perspective on how your Gamelift FlexMatch solution is performing.

#### FlexMatch Metrics

GameLift FlexMatch sends metrics to CloudWatch so that you can collect and
analyze the activity of your matchmaking solution, including match acceptance
workflow, ticket consumtion.

You can then use CloudWatch alarms to alert you, for example, when matches has
been rejected (potential matches that were rejected by at least one player
since the last report) exceed a certain thresold which could means that you may
have an issue in your matchmaking rules.

CDK provides methods for accessing GameLift FlexMatch metrics with default configuration,
such as `metricRuleEvaluationsPassed`, or `metricRuleEvaluationsFailed` (see
[`IMatchmakingRuleSet`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-gamelift.IMatchmakingRuleSet.html)
for a full list). CDK also provides a generic `metric` method that can be used
to produce metric configurations for any metric provided by GameLift FlexMatch;
the configurations are pre-populated with the correct dimensions for the
matchmaking configuration.

```python
# matchmaking_rule_set: gamelift.MatchmakingRuleSet

# Alarm that triggers when the per-second average of not placed matches exceed 10%
rule_evaluation_ratio = cloudwatch.MathExpression(
    expression="1 - (ruleEvaluationsPassed / ruleEvaluationsFailed)",
    using_metrics={
        "rule_evaluations_passed": matchmaking_rule_set.metric_rule_evaluations_passed(statistic=cloudwatch.Statistic.SUM),
        "rule_evaluations_failed": matchmaking_rule_set.metric("ruleEvaluationsFailed")
    }
)
cloudwatch.Alarm(self, "Alarm",
    metric=rule_evaluation_ratio,
    threshold=0.1,
    evaluation_periods=3
)
```

See: [Monitoring Using CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift Developer Guide*.

## GameLift Hosting

### Uploading builds and scripts to GameLift

Before deploying your GameLift-enabled multiplayer game servers for hosting with the GameLift service, you need to upload
your game server files. This section provides guidance on preparing and uploading custom game server build
files or Realtime Servers server script files. When you upload files, you create a GameLift build or script resource, which
you then deploy on fleets of hosting resources.

To troubleshoot fleet activation problems related to the server script, see [Debug GameLift fleet issues](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creating-debug.html).

#### Upload a custom server build to GameLift

Before uploading your configured game server to GameLift for hosting, package the game build files into a build directory.
This directory must include all components required to run your game servers and host game sessions, including the following:

* Game server binaries – The binary files required to run the game server. A build can include binaries for multiple game
  servers built to run on the same platform. For a list of supported platforms, see [Download Amazon GameLift SDKs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/gamelift-supported.html).
* Dependencies – Any dependent files that your game server executables require to run. Examples include assets, configuration
  files, and dependent libraries.
* Install script – A script file to handle tasks that are required to fully install your game build on GameLift hosting
  servers. Place this file at the root of the build directory. GameLift runs the install script as part of fleet creation.

You can set up any application in your build, including your install script, to access your resources securely on other AWS
services.

```python
# bucket: s3.Bucket

build = gamelift.Build(self, "Build",
    content=gamelift.Content.from_bucket(bucket, "sample-asset-key")
)

CfnOutput(self, "BuildArn", value=build.build_arn)
CfnOutput(self, "BuildId", value=build.build_id)
```

To specify a server SDK version you used when integrating your game server build with Amazon GameLift use the `serverSdkVersion` parameter:

> See [Integrate games with custom game servers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/integration-custom-intro.html) for more details.

```python
# bucket: s3.Bucket

build = gamelift.Build(self, "Build",
    content=gamelift.Content.from_bucket(bucket, "sample-asset-key"),
    server_sdk_version="5.0.0"
)
```

#### Upload a realtime server Script

Your server script can include one or more files combined into a single .zip file for uploading. The .zip file must contain
all files that your script needs to run.

You can store your zipped script files in either a local file directory or in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
bucket or defines a directory asset which is archived as a .zip file and uploaded to S3 during deployment.

After you create the script resource, GameLift deploys the script with a new Realtime Servers fleet. GameLift installs your
server script onto each instance in the fleet, placing the script files in `/local/game`.

```python
# bucket: s3.Bucket

gamelift.Script(self, "Script",
    content=gamelift.Content.from_bucket(bucket, "sample-asset-key")
)
```

### Defining a GameLift Fleet

#### Creating a custom game server fleet

Your uploaded game servers are hosted on GameLift virtual computing resources,
called instances. You set up your hosting resources by creating a fleet of
instances and deploying them to run your game servers. You can design a fleet
to fit your game's needs.

```python
gamelift.BuildFleet(self, "Game server fleet",
    fleet_name="test-fleet",
    content=gamelift.Build.from_asset(self, "Build", path.join(__dirname, "CustomerGameServer")),
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C4, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE),
    runtime_configuration=gamelift.RuntimeConfiguration(
        server_processes=[gamelift.ServerProcess(
            launch_path="test-launch-path"
        )]
    )
)
```

### Managing game servers launch configuration

GameLift uses a fleet's runtime configuration to determine the type and number
of processes to run on each instance in the fleet. At a minimum, a runtime
configuration contains one server process configuration that represents one
game server executable. You can also define additional server process
configurations to run other types of processes related to your game. Each
server process configuration contains the following information:

* The file name and path of an executable in your game build.
* Optionally Parameters to pass to the process on launch.
* The number of processes to run concurrently.

A GameLift instance is limited to 50 processes running concurrently.

```python
# build: gamelift.Build

# Server processes can be delcared in a declarative way through the constructor
fleet = gamelift.BuildFleet(self, "Game server fleet",
    fleet_name="test-fleet",
    content=build,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C4, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE),
    runtime_configuration=gamelift.RuntimeConfiguration(
        server_processes=[gamelift.ServerProcess(
            launch_path="/local/game/GameLiftExampleServer.x86_64",
            parameters="-logFile /local/game/logs/myserver1935.log -port 1935",
            concurrent_executions=100
        )]
    )
)
```

See [Managing how game servers are launched for hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-multiprocess.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift Developer Guide*.

### Defining an instance type

GameLift uses Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) resources, called
instances, to deploy your game servers and host game sessions for your players.
When setting up a new fleet, you decide what type of instances your game needs
and how to run game server processes on them (using a runtime configuration). All instances in a fleet use the same type of resources and the same runtime
configuration. You can edit a fleet's runtime configuration and other fleet
properties, but the type of resources cannot be changed.

```python
# build: gamelift.Build

gamelift.BuildFleet(self, "Game server fleet",
    fleet_name="test-fleet",
    content=build,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C5, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE),
    runtime_configuration=gamelift.RuntimeConfiguration(
        server_processes=[gamelift.ServerProcess(
            launch_path="/local/game/GameLiftExampleServer.x86_64"
        )]
    )
)
```

### Using Spot instances

When setting up your hosting resources, you have the option of using Spot
Instances, On-Demand Instances, or a combination.

By default, fleet are using on demand capacity.

```python
# build: gamelift.Build

gamelift.BuildFleet(self, "Game server fleet",
    fleet_name="test-fleet",
    content=build,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C4, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE),
    runtime_configuration=gamelift.RuntimeConfiguration(
        server_processes=[gamelift.ServerProcess(
            launch_path="/local/game/GameLiftExampleServer.x86_64"
        )]
    ),
    use_spot=True
)
```

### Allowing Ingress traffic

The allowed IP address ranges and port settings that allow inbound traffic to
access game sessions on this fleet.

New game sessions are assigned an IP address/port number combination, which
must fall into the fleet's allowed ranges. Fleets with custom game builds must
have permissions explicitly set. For Realtime Servers fleets, GameLift
automatically opens two port ranges, one for TCP messaging and one for UDP.

```python
# build: gamelift.Build


fleet = gamelift.BuildFleet(self, "Game server fleet",
    fleet_name="test-fleet",
    content=build,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C4, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE),
    runtime_configuration=gamelift.RuntimeConfiguration(
        server_processes=[gamelift.ServerProcess(
            launch_path="/local/game/GameLiftExampleServer.x86_64"
        )]
    ),
    ingress_rules=[gamelift.IngressRule(
        source=gamelift.Peer.any_ipv4(),
        port=gamelift.Port.tcp_range(100, 200)
    )]
)
# Allowing a specific CIDR for port 1111 on UDP Protocol
fleet.add_ingress_rule(gamelift.Peer.ipv4("1.2.3.4/32"), gamelift.Port.udp(1111))
```

### Managing locations

A single Amazon GameLift fleet has a home Region by default (the Region you
deploy it to), but it can deploy resources to any number of GameLift supported
Regions. Select Regions based on where your players are located and your
latency needs.

By default, home region is used as default location but we can add new locations if needed and define desired capacity

```python
# build: gamelift.Build


# Locations can be added directly through constructor
fleet = gamelift.BuildFleet(self, "Game server fleet",
    fleet_name="test-fleet",
    content=build,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C4, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE),
    runtime_configuration=gamelift.RuntimeConfiguration(
        server_processes=[gamelift.ServerProcess(
            launch_path="/local/game/GameLiftExampleServer.x86_64"
        )]
    ),
    locations=[gamelift.Location(
        region="eu-west-1",
        capacity=gamelift.LocationCapacity(
            desired_capacity=5,
            min_size=2,
            max_size=10
        )
    ), gamelift.Location(
        region="us-east-1",
        capacity=gamelift.LocationCapacity(
            desired_capacity=5,
            min_size=2,
            max_size=10
        )
    )]
)

# Or through dedicated methods
fleet.add_location("ap-southeast-1", 5, 2, 10)
```

### Specifying an IAM role for a Fleet

Some GameLift features require you to extend limited access to your AWS
resources. This is done by creating an AWS IAM role. The GameLift Fleet class
automatically created an IAM role with all the minimum necessary permissions
for GameLift to access your resources. If you wish, you may
specify your own IAM role.

```python
# build: gamelift.Build

role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.CompositePrincipal(iam.ServicePrincipal("gamelift.amazonaws.com"))
)
role.add_managed_policy(iam.ManagedPolicy.from_aws_managed_policy_name("CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy"))

fleet = gamelift.BuildFleet(self, "Game server fleet",
    fleet_name="test-fleet",
    content=build,
    instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C5, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE),
    runtime_configuration=gamelift.RuntimeConfiguration(
        server_processes=[gamelift.ServerProcess(
            launch_path="/local/game/GameLiftExampleServer.x86_64"
        )]
    ),
    role=role
)

# Actions can also be grantted through dedicated method
fleet.grant(role, "gamelift:ListFleets")
```

### Alias

A GameLift alias is used to abstract a fleet designation. Fleet designations
tell Amazon GameLift where to search for available resources when creating new
game sessions for players. By using aliases instead of specific fleet IDs, you
can more easily and seamlessly switch player traffic from one fleet to another
by changing the alias's target location.

```python
# fleet: gamelift.BuildFleet


# Add an alias to an existing fleet using a dedicated fleet method
live_alias = fleet.add_alias("live")

# You can also create a standalone alias
gamelift.Alias(self, "TerminalAlias",
    alias_name="terminal-alias",
    terminal_message="A terminal message"
)
```

See [Add an alias to a GameLift fleet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/aliases-creating.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift Developer Guide*.

### Monitoring your Fleet

GameLift is integrated with CloudWatch, so you can monitor the performance of
your game servers via logs and metrics.

#### Fleet Metrics

GameLift Fleet sends metrics to CloudWatch so that you can collect and analyze
the activity of your Fleet, including game  and player sessions and server
processes.

You can then use CloudWatch alarms to alert you, for example, when matches has
been rejected (potential matches that were rejected by at least one player
since the last report) exceed a certain threshold which could means that you may
have an issue in your matchmaking rules.

CDK provides methods for accessing GameLift Fleet metrics with default configuration,
such as `metricActiveInstances`, or `metricIdleInstances` (see [`IFleet`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-gamelift.IFleet.html)
for a full list). CDK also provides a generic `metric` method that can be used
to produce metric configurations for any metric provided by GameLift Fleet,
Game sessions or server processes; the configurations are pre-populated with
the correct dimensions for the matchmaking configuration.

```python
# fleet: gamelift.BuildFleet

# Alarm that triggers when the per-second average of not used instances exceed 10%
instances_used_ratio = cloudwatch.MathExpression(
    expression="1 - (activeInstances / idleInstances)",
    using_metrics={
        "active_instances": fleet.metric("ActiveInstances", statistic=cloudwatch.Statistic.SUM),
        "idle_instances": fleet.metric_idle_instances()
    }
)
cloudwatch.Alarm(self, "Alarm",
    metric=instances_used_ratio,
    threshold=0.1,
    evaluation_periods=3
)
```

See: [Monitoring Using CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/monitoring-cloudwatch.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift Developer Guide*.

## Game session queue

The game session queue is the primary mechanism for processing new game session
requests and locating available game servers to host them. Although it is
possible to request a new game session be hosted on specific fleet or location.

The `GameSessionQueue` resource creates a placement queue that processes requests for
new game sessions. A queue uses FleetIQ algorithms to determine the best placement
locations and find an available game server, then prompts the game server to start a
new game session. Queues can have destinations (GameLift fleets or aliases), which
determine where the queue can place new game sessions. A queue can have destinations
with varied fleet type (Spot and On-Demand), instance type, and AWS Region.

```python
# fleet: gamelift.BuildFleet
# alias: gamelift.Alias


queue = gamelift.GameSessionQueue(self, "GameSessionQueue",
    game_session_queue_name="my-queue-name",
    destinations=[fleet]
)
queue.add_destination(alias)
```

A more complex configuration can also be definied to override how FleetIQ algorithms prioritize game session placement in order to favour a destination based on `Cost`, `Latency`, `Destination order`or `Location`.

```python
# fleet: gamelift.BuildFleet
# topic: sns.Topic


gamelift.GameSessionQueue(self, "MyGameSessionQueue",
    game_session_queue_name="test-gameSessionQueue",
    custom_event_data="test-event-data",
    allowed_locations=["eu-west-1", "eu-west-2"],
    destinations=[fleet],
    notification_target=topic,
    player_latency_policies=[gamelift.PlayerLatencyPolicy(
        maximum_individual_player_latency=Duration.millis(100),
        policy_duration=Duration.seconds(300)
    )],
    priority_configuration=gamelift.PriorityConfiguration(
        location_order=["eu-west-1", "eu-west-2"
        ],
        priority_order=[gamelift.PriorityType.LATENCY, gamelift.PriorityType.COST, gamelift.PriorityType.DESTINATION, gamelift.PriorityType.LOCATION
        ]
    ),
    timeout=Duration.seconds(300)
)
```

See [Setting up GameLift queues for game session placement](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/realtime-script-uploading.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift Developer Guide*.

## GameLift FleetIQ

The GameLift FleetIQ solution is a game hosting layer that supplements the full
set of computing resource management tools that you get with Amazon EC2 and
Auto Scaling. This solution lets you directly manage your Amazon EC2 and Auto
Scaling resources and integrate as needed with other AWS services.

### Defining a Game Server Group

When using GameLift FleetIQ, you prepare to launch Amazon EC2 instances as
usual: make an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) with your game server software,
create an Amazon EC2 launch template, and define configuration settings for an
Auto Scaling group. However, instead of creating an Auto Scaling group
directly, you create a GameLift FleetIQ game server group with your Amazon EC2
and Auto Scaling resources and configuration. All game server groups must have
at least two instance types defined for it.

Once a game server group and Auto Scaling group are up and running with
instances deployed, when updating a Game Server Group instance, only certain
properties in the Auto Scaling group may be overwrite. For all other Auto
Scaling group properties, such as MinSize, MaxSize, and LaunchTemplate, you can
modify these directly on the Auto Scaling group using the AWS Console or
dedicated Api.

```python
# launch_template: ec2.ILaunchTemplate
# vpc: ec2.IVpc


gamelift.GameServerGroup(self, "Game server group",
    game_server_group_name="sample-gameservergroup-name",
    instance_definitions=[gamelift.InstanceDefinition(
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C5, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE)
    ), gamelift.InstanceDefinition(
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C4, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE)
    )],
    launch_template=launch_template,
    vpc=vpc
)
```

See [Manage game server groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-integrate-gameservergroup.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide*.

### Scaling Policy

The scaling policy uses the metric `PercentUtilizedGameServers` to maintain a
buffer of idle game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and
players.

```python
# launch_template: ec2.ILaunchTemplate
# vpc: ec2.IVpc


gamelift.GameServerGroup(self, "Game server group",
    game_server_group_name="sample-gameservergroup-name",
    instance_definitions=[gamelift.InstanceDefinition(
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C5, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE)
    ), gamelift.InstanceDefinition(
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C4, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE)
    )],
    launch_template=launch_template,
    vpc=vpc,
    auto_scaling_policy=gamelift.AutoScalingPolicy(
        estimated_instance_warmup=Duration.minutes(5),
        target_tracking_configuration=5
    )
)
```

See [Manage game server groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-integrate-gameservergroup.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide*.

### Specifying an IAM role for GameLift

The GameLift FleetIQ class automatically creates an IAM role with all the minimum necessary
permissions for GameLift to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups. If you wish, you may
specify your own IAM role. It must have the correct permissions, or FleetIQ creation or resource usage may fail.

```python
# launch_template: ec2.ILaunchTemplate
# vpc: ec2.IVpc


role = iam.Role(self, "Role",
    assumed_by=iam.CompositePrincipal(iam.ServicePrincipal("gamelift.amazonaws.com"),
    iam.ServicePrincipal("autoscaling.amazonaws.com"))
)
role.add_managed_policy(iam.ManagedPolicy.from_aws_managed_policy_name("GameLiftGameServerGroupPolicy"))

gamelift.GameServerGroup(self, "Game server group",
    game_server_group_name="sample-gameservergroup-name",
    instance_definitions=[gamelift.InstanceDefinition(
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C5, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE)
    ), gamelift.InstanceDefinition(
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C4, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE)
    )],
    launch_template=launch_template,
    vpc=vpc,
    role=role
)
```

See [Controlling Access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-iam-permissions-roles.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide*.

### Specifying VPC Subnets

GameLift FleetIQ use by default, all supported GameLift FleetIQ Availability
Zones in your chosen region. You can override this parameter to specify VPCs
subnets that you've set up.

This property cannot be updated after the game server group is created, and the
corresponding Auto Scaling group will always use the property value that is set
with this request, even if the Auto Scaling group is updated directly.

```python
# launch_template: ec2.ILaunchTemplate
# vpc: ec2.IVpc


gamelift.GameServerGroup(self, "GameServerGroup",
    game_server_group_name="sample-gameservergroup-name",
    instance_definitions=[gamelift.InstanceDefinition(
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C5, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE)
    ), gamelift.InstanceDefinition(
        instance_type=ec2.InstanceType.of(ec2.InstanceClass.C4, ec2.InstanceSize.LARGE)
    )],
    launch_template=launch_template,
    vpc=vpc,
    vpc_subnets=ec2.SubnetSelection(subnet_type=ec2.SubnetType.PUBLIC)
)
```

### FleetIQ Monitoring

GameLift FleetIQ sends metrics to CloudWatch so that you can collect and
analyze the activity of your Game server fleet, including the number of
utilized game servers, and the number of game server interruption due to
limited Spot availability.

You can then use CloudWatch alarms to alert you, for example, when the portion
of game servers that are currently supporting game executions exceed a certain
threshold which could means that your autoscaling policy need to be adjust to
add more instances to match with player demand.

CDK provides a generic `metric` method that can be used
to produce metric configurations for any metric provided by GameLift FleetIQ;
the configurations are pre-populated with the correct dimensions for the
matchmaking configuration.

```python
# game_server_group: gamelift.IGameServerGroup

# Alarm that triggers when the percent of utilized game servers exceed 90%
cloudwatch.Alarm(self, "Alarm",
    metric=game_server_group.metric("UtilizedGameServers"),
    threshold=0.9,
    evaluation_periods=2
)
```

See: [Monitoring with CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/fleetiqguide/gsg-metrics.html)
in the *Amazon GameLift FleetIQ Developer Guide*.

        :param path: Either a directory with the game content bundle or a .zip file.
        :param deploy_time: Whether or not the asset needs to exist beyond deployment time; i.e. are copied over to a different location and not needed afterwards. Setting this property to true has an impact on the lifecycle of the asset, because we will assume that it is safe to delete after the CloudFormation deployment succeeds. For example, Lambda Function assets are copied over to Lambda during deployment. Therefore, it is not necessary to store the asset in S3, so we consider those deployTime assets. Default: false
        :param display_name: A display name for this asset. If supplied, the display name will be used in locations where the asset identifier is printed, like in the CLI progress information. If the same asset is added multiple times, the display name of the first occurrence is used. The default is the construct path of the Asset construct, with respect to the enclosing stack. If the asset is produced by a construct helper function (such as ``lambda.Code.fromAsset()``), this will look like ``MyFunction/Code``. We use the stack-relative construct path so that in the common case where you have multiple stacks with the same asset, we won't show something like ``/MyBetaStack/MyFunction/Code`` when you are actually deploying to production. Default: - Stack-relative construct path
        :param readers: A list of principals that should be able to read this asset from S3. You can use ``asset.grantRead(principal)`` to grant read permissions later. Default: - No principals that can read file asset.
        :param source_kms_key: The ARN of the KMS key used to encrypt the handler code. Default: - the default server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys(SSE-S3) key will be used.
        :param asset_hash: Specify a custom hash for this asset. If ``assetHashType`` is set it must be set to ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``. For consistency, this custom hash will be SHA256 hashed and encoded as hex. The resulting hash will be the asset hash. NOTE: the hash is used in order to identify a specific revision of the asset, and used for optimizing and caching deployment activities related to this asset such as packaging, uploading to Amazon S3, etc. If you chose to customize the hash, you will need to make sure it is updated every time the asset changes, or otherwise it is possible that some deployments will not be invalidated. Default: - based on ``assetHashType``
        :param asset_hash_type: Specifies the type of hash to calculate for this asset. If ``assetHash`` is configured, this option must be ``undefined`` or ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``. Default: - the default is ``AssetHashType.SOURCE``, but if ``assetHash`` is explicitly specified this value defaults to ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``.
        :param bundling: Bundle the asset by executing a command in a Docker container or a custom bundling provider. The asset path will be mounted at ``/asset-input``. The Docker container is responsible for putting content at ``/asset-output``. The content at ``/asset-output`` will be zipped and used as the final asset. Default: - uploaded as-is to S3 if the asset is a regular file or a .zip file, archived into a .zip file and uploaded to S3 otherwise
        :param exclude: File paths matching the patterns will be excluded. See ``ignoreMode`` to set the matching behavior. Has no effect on Assets bundled using the ``bundling`` property. Default: - nothing is excluded
        :param follow_symlinks: A strategy for how to handle symlinks. Default: SymlinkFollowMode.NEVER
        :param ignore_mode: The ignore behavior to use for ``exclude`` patterns. Default: IgnoreMode.GLOB

        '''(experimental) Properties for a new Gamelift fleet.

        :param fleet_name: (experimental) A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet. Fleet names do not need to be unique.
        :param instance_type: (experimental) The GameLift-supported Amazon EC2 instance type to use for all fleet instances. Instance type determines the computing resources that will be used to host your game servers, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
        :param runtime_configuration: (experimental) A collection of server process configurations that describe the set of processes to run on each instance in a fleet. Server processes run either an executable in a custom game build or a Realtime Servers script. GameLift launches the configured processes, manages their life cycle, and replaces them as needed. Each instance checks regularly for an updated runtime configuration. A GameLift instance is limited to 50 processes running concurrently. To calculate the total number of processes in a runtime configuration, add the values of the ConcurrentExecutions parameter for each ServerProcess.
        :param description: (experimental) A human-readable description of the fleet. Default: - no description is provided
        :param desired_capacity: (experimental) The number of EC2 instances that you want this fleet to host. When creating a new fleet, GameLift automatically sets this value to "1" and initiates a single instance. Once the fleet is active, update this value to trigger GameLift to add or remove instances from the fleet. Default: - Default capacity is 0
        :param locations: (experimental) A set of remote locations to deploy additional instances to and manage as part of the fleet. This parameter can only be used when creating fleets in AWS Regions that support multiple locations. You can add any GameLift-supported AWS Region as a remote location, in the form of an AWS Region code such as ``us-west-2``. To create a fleet with instances in the home region only, omit this parameter. Default: - Create a fleet with instances in the home region only
        :param max_size: (experimental) The maximum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet location. Default: 1
        :param metric_group: (experimental) The name of an AWS CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. A metric group is used to aggregate the metrics for multiple fleets. You can specify an existing metric group name or set a new name to create a new metric group. A fleet can be included in only one metric group at a time. Default: - Fleet metrics are aggregated with other fleets in the default metric group
        :param min_size: (experimental) The minimum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet location. Default: 0
        :param peer_vpc: (experimental) A VPC peering connection between your GameLift-hosted game servers and your other non-GameLift resources. Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering connections to enable your game servers to communicate directly and privately with your other AWS resources, such as a web service or a repository. You can establish VPC peering with any resources that run on AWS and are managed by an AWS account that you have access to. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. Warning: Be sure to create a VPC Peering authorization through Gamelift Service API. Default: - no vpc peering
        :param protect_new_game_session: (experimental) The status of termination protection for active game sessions on the fleet. By default, new game sessions are protected and cannot be terminated during a scale-down event. Default: true - Game sessions in ``ACTIVE`` status cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
        :param resource_creation_limit_policy: (experimental) A policy that limits the number of game sessions that an individual player can create on instances in this fleet within a specified span of time. Default: - No resource creation limit policy
        :param role: (experimental) The IAM role assumed by GameLift fleet instances to access AWS ressources. With a role set, any application that runs on an instance in this fleet can assume the role, including install scripts, server processes, and daemons (background processes). If providing a custom role, it needs to trust the GameLift service principal (gamelift.amazonaws.com). No permission is required by default. This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created. Default: - a role will be created with default trust to Gamelift service principal.
        :param use_certificate: (experimental) Prompts GameLift to generate a TLS/SSL certificate for the fleet. GameLift uses the certificates to encrypt traffic between game clients and the game servers running on GameLift. You can't change this property after you create the fleet. Additionnal info: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates expire after 13 months. Certificate expiration can cause fleets to fail, preventing players from connecting to instances in the fleet. We recommend you replace fleets before 13 months, consider using fleet aliases for a smooth transition. Default: - TLS/SSL certificate are generated for the fleet
        :param use_spot: (experimental) Indicates whether to use On-Demand or Spot instances for this fleet. By default, fleet use on demand capacity. This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created. Default: - Gamelift fleet use on demand capacity

        :param launch_template: (experimental) The Amazon EC2 launch template that contains configuration settings and game server code to be deployed to all instances in the game server group. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs. NOTE: If you specify network interfaces in your launch template, you must explicitly set the property AssociatePublicIpAddress to ``true``. If no network interface is specified in the launch template, GameLift FleetIQ uses your account's default VPC.
        :param vpc: (experimental) The VPC network to place the game server group in. By default, all GameLift FleetIQ-supported Availability Zones are used. You can use this parameter to specify VPCs that you've set up. This property cannot be updated after the game server group is created, and the corresponding Auto Scaling group will always use the property value that is set with this request, even if the Auto Scaling group is updated directly.
        :param auto_scaling_policy: (experimental) Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group that is optimized for game hosting. The scaling policy uses the metric ``PercentUtilizedGameServers`` to maintain a buffer of idle game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and players. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs. Default: no autoscaling policy settled
        :param balancing_strategy: (experimental) Indicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Default: SPOT_PREFERRED
        :param delete_option: (experimental) The type of delete to perform. To delete a game server group, specify the DeleteOption Default: SAFE_DELETE
        :param max_size: (experimental) The maximum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale up the group above this maximum. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs. Default: the default is 1
        :param min_size: (experimental) The minimum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and Amazon EC2 do not scale down the group below this minimum. In production, this value should be set to at least 1. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs. Default: the default is 0
        :param protect_game_server: (experimental) A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion. An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. Default: game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event
        :param role: (experimental) The IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups. Default: - a role will be created with default trust to Gamelift and Autoscaling service principal with a default policy ``GameLiftGameServerGroupPolicy`` attached.

        - If player latency data is not included, destinations and locations are prioritized first on destination list order (1), and then on location (alphabetical) (2).
          This approach ensures that the queue's top priority is to place game sessions on the first destination fleet listed. If that fleet has multiple locations, the game session is placed on the first location (when listed alphabetically).

        Changing the priority order will affect how game sessions are placed.

        :param path: The path to the asset file or directory.
        :param deploy_time: Whether or not the asset needs to exist beyond deployment time; i.e. are copied over to a different location and not needed afterwards. Setting this property to true has an impact on the lifecycle of the asset, because we will assume that it is safe to delete after the CloudFormation deployment succeeds. For example, Lambda Function assets are copied over to Lambda during deployment. Therefore, it is not necessary to store the asset in S3, so we consider those deployTime assets. Default: false
        :param display_name: A display name for this asset. If supplied, the display name will be used in locations where the asset identifier is printed, like in the CLI progress information. If the same asset is added multiple times, the display name of the first occurrence is used. The default is the construct path of the Asset construct, with respect to the enclosing stack. If the asset is produced by a construct helper function (such as ``lambda.Code.fromAsset()``), this will look like ``MyFunction/Code``. We use the stack-relative construct path so that in the common case where you have multiple stacks with the same asset, we won't show something like ``/MyBetaStack/MyFunction/Code`` when you are actually deploying to production. Default: - Stack-relative construct path
        :param readers: A list of principals that should be able to read this asset from S3. You can use ``asset.grantRead(principal)`` to grant read permissions later. Default: - No principals that can read file asset.
        :param source_kms_key: The ARN of the KMS key used to encrypt the handler code. Default: - the default server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys(SSE-S3) key will be used.
        :param asset_hash: Specify a custom hash for this asset. If ``assetHashType`` is set it must be set to ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``. For consistency, this custom hash will be SHA256 hashed and encoded as hex. The resulting hash will be the asset hash. NOTE: the hash is used in order to identify a specific revision of the asset, and used for optimizing and caching deployment activities related to this asset such as packaging, uploading to Amazon S3, etc. If you chose to customize the hash, you will need to make sure it is updated every time the asset changes, or otherwise it is possible that some deployments will not be invalidated. Default: - based on ``assetHashType``
        :param asset_hash_type: Specifies the type of hash to calculate for this asset. If ``assetHash`` is configured, this option must be ``undefined`` or ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``. Default: - the default is ``AssetHashType.SOURCE``, but if ``assetHash`` is explicitly specified this value defaults to ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``.
        :param bundling: Bundle the asset by executing a command in a Docker container or a custom bundling provider. The asset path will be mounted at ``/asset-input``. The Docker container is responsible for putting content at ``/asset-output``. The content at ``/asset-output`` will be zipped and used as the final asset. Default: - uploaded as-is to S3 if the asset is a regular file or a .zip file, archived into a .zip file and uploaded to S3 otherwise
        :param exclude: File paths matching the patterns will be excluded. See ``ignoreMode`` to set the matching behavior. Has no effect on Assets bundled using the ``bundling`` property. Default: - nothing is excluded
        :param follow_symlinks: A strategy for how to handle symlinks. Default: SymlinkFollowMode.NEVER
        :param ignore_mode: The ignore behavior to use for ``exclude`` patterns. Default: IgnoreMode.GLOB

        :param locations: (experimental) A set of remote locations to deploy additional instances to and manage as part of the fleet. This parameter can only be used when creating fleets in AWS Regions that support multiple locations. You can add any GameLift-supported AWS Region as a remote location, in the form of an AWS Region code such as ``us-west-2``. To create a fleet with instances in the home region only, omit this parameter. Default: - Create a fleet with instances in the home region only
        :param max_size: (experimental) The maximum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet location. Default: 1
        :param metric_group: (experimental) The name of an AWS CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. A metric group is used to aggregate the metrics for multiple fleets. You can specify an existing metric group name or set a new name to create a new metric group. A fleet can be included in only one metric group at a time. Default: - Fleet metrics are aggregated with other fleets in the default metric group
        :param min_size: (experimental) The minimum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet location. Default: 0
        :param peer_vpc: (experimental) A VPC peering connection between your GameLift-hosted game servers and your other non-GameLift resources. Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering connections to enable your game servers to communicate directly and privately with your other AWS resources, such as a web service or a repository. You can establish VPC peering with any resources that run on AWS and are managed by an AWS account that you have access to. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. Warning: Be sure to create a VPC Peering authorization through Gamelift Service API. Default: - no vpc peering
        :param protect_new_game_session: (experimental) The status of termination protection for active game sessions on the fleet. By default, new game sessions are protected and cannot be terminated during a scale-down event. Default: true - Game sessions in ``ACTIVE`` status cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
        :param resource_creation_limit_policy: (experimental) A policy that limits the number of game sessions that an individual player can create on instances in this fleet within a specified span of time. Default: - No resource creation limit policy
        :param role: (experimental) The IAM role assumed by GameLift fleet instances to access AWS ressources. With a role set, any application that runs on an instance in this fleet can assume the role, including install scripts, server processes, and daemons (background processes). If providing a custom role, it needs to trust the GameLift service principal (gamelift.amazonaws.com). No permission is required by default. This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created. Default: - a role will be created with default trust to Gamelift service principal.
        :param use_certificate: (experimental) Prompts GameLift to generate a TLS/SSL certificate for the fleet. GameLift uses the certificates to encrypt traffic between game clients and the game servers running on GameLift. You can't change this property after you create the fleet. Additionnal info: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates expire after 13 months. Certificate expiration can cause fleets to fail, preventing players from connecting to instances in the fleet. We recommend you replace fleets before 13 months, consider using fleet aliases for a smooth transition. Default: - TLS/SSL certificate are generated for the fleet
        :param use_spot: (experimental) Indicates whether to use On-Demand or Spot instances for this fleet. By default, fleet use on demand capacity. This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created. Default: - Gamelift fleet use on demand capacity
        :param content: (experimental) A build to be deployed on the fleet. The build must have been successfully uploaded to Amazon GameLift and be in a ``READY`` status. This fleet setting cannot be changed once the fleet is created.
        :param ingress_rules: (experimental) The allowed IP address ranges and port settings that allow inbound traffic to access game sessions on this fleet. This property must be set before players can connect to game sessions. Default: no inbound traffic allowed

        :param color: The hex color code, prefixed with '#' (e.g. '#00ff00'), to use when this metric is rendered on a graph. The ``Color`` class has a set of standard colors that can be used here. Default: - Automatic color
        :param dimensions_map: Dimensions of the metric. Default: - No dimensions.
        :param id: Unique identifier for this metric when used in dashboard widgets. The id can be used as a variable to represent this metric in math expressions. Valid characters are letters, numbers, and underscore. The first character must be a lowercase letter. Default: - No ID
        :param label: Label for this metric when added to a Graph in a Dashboard. You can use `dynamic labels <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/graph-dynamic-labels.html>`_ to show summary information about the entire displayed time series in the legend. For example, if you use:: [max: ${MAX}] MyMetric As the metric label, the maximum value in the visible range will be shown next to the time series name in the graph's legend. Default: - No label
        :param period: The period over which the specified statistic is applied. Default: Duration.minutes(5)
        :param region: Region which this metric comes from. Default: - Deployment region.
        :param stack_account: Account of the stack this metric is attached to. Default: - Deployment account.
        :param stack_region: Region of the stack this metric is attached to. Default: - Deployment region.
        :param statistic: What function to use for aggregating. Use the ``aws_cloudwatch.Stats`` helper class to construct valid input strings. Can be one of the following: - "Minimum" | "min" - "Maximum" | "max" - "Average" | "avg" - "Sum" | "sum" - "SampleCount | "n" - "pNN.NN" - "tmNN.NN" | "tm(NN.NN%:NN.NN%)" - "iqm" - "wmNN.NN" | "wm(NN.NN%:NN.NN%)" - "tcNN.NN" | "tc(NN.NN%:NN.NN%)" - "tsNN.NN" | "ts(NN.NN%:NN.NN%)" Default: Average
        :param unit: Unit used to filter the metric stream. Only refer to datums emitted to the metric stream with the given unit and ignore all others. Only useful when datums are being emitted to the same metric stream under different units. The default is to use all matric datums in the stream, regardless of unit, which is recommended in nearly all cases. CloudWatch does not honor this property for graphs. Default: - All metric datums in the given metric stream
        :param visible: Whether this metric should be visible in dashboard graphs. Setting this to false is useful when you want to hide raw metrics that are used in math expressions, and show only the expression results. Default: true

        :param scope: -

        :param path: -
        :param deploy_time: Whether or not the asset needs to exist beyond deployment time; i.e. are copied over to a different location and not needed afterwards. Setting this property to true has an impact on the lifecycle of the asset, because we will assume that it is safe to delete after the CloudFormation deployment succeeds. For example, Lambda Function assets are copied over to Lambda during deployment. Therefore, it is not necessary to store the asset in S3, so we consider those deployTime assets. Default: false
        :param display_name: A display name for this asset. If supplied, the display name will be used in locations where the asset identifier is printed, like in the CLI progress information. If the same asset is added multiple times, the display name of the first occurrence is used. The default is the construct path of the Asset construct, with respect to the enclosing stack. If the asset is produced by a construct helper function (such as ``lambda.Code.fromAsset()``), this will look like ``MyFunction/Code``. We use the stack-relative construct path so that in the common case where you have multiple stacks with the same asset, we won't show something like ``/MyBetaStack/MyFunction/Code`` when you are actually deploying to production. Default: - Stack-relative construct path
        :param readers: A list of principals that should be able to read this asset from S3. You can use ``asset.grantRead(principal)`` to grant read permissions later. Default: - No principals that can read file asset.
        :param source_kms_key: The ARN of the KMS key used to encrypt the handler code. Default: - the default server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys(SSE-S3) key will be used.
        :param asset_hash: Specify a custom hash for this asset. If ``assetHashType`` is set it must be set to ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``. For consistency, this custom hash will be SHA256 hashed and encoded as hex. The resulting hash will be the asset hash. NOTE: the hash is used in order to identify a specific revision of the asset, and used for optimizing and caching deployment activities related to this asset such as packaging, uploading to Amazon S3, etc. If you chose to customize the hash, you will need to make sure it is updated every time the asset changes, or otherwise it is possible that some deployments will not be invalidated. Default: - based on ``assetHashType``
        :param asset_hash_type: Specifies the type of hash to calculate for this asset. If ``assetHash`` is configured, this option must be ``undefined`` or ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``. Default: - the default is ``AssetHashType.SOURCE``, but if ``assetHash`` is explicitly specified this value defaults to ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``.
        :param bundling: Bundle the asset by executing a command in a Docker container or a custom bundling provider. The asset path will be mounted at ``/asset-input``. The Docker container is responsible for putting content at ``/asset-output``. The content at ``/asset-output`` will be zipped and used as the final asset. Default: - uploaded as-is to S3 if the asset is a regular file or a .zip file, archived into a .zip file and uploaded to S3 otherwise
        :param exclude: File paths matching the patterns will be excluded. See ``ignoreMode`` to set the matching behavior. Has no effect on Assets bundled using the ``bundling`` property. Default: - nothing is excluded
        :param follow_symlinks: A strategy for how to handle symlinks. Default: SymlinkFollowMode.NEVER

        :param path: -
        :param deploy_time: Whether or not the asset needs to exist beyond deployment time; i.e. are copied over to a different location and not needed afterwards. Setting this property to true has an impact on the lifecycle of the asset, because we will assume that it is safe to delete after the CloudFormation deployment succeeds. For example, Lambda Function assets are copied over to Lambda during deployment. Therefore, it is not necessary to store the asset in S3, so we consider those deployTime assets. Default: false
        :param display_name: A display name for this asset. If supplied, the display name will be used in locations where the asset identifier is printed, like in the CLI progress information. If the same asset is added multiple times, the display name of the first occurrence is used. The default is the construct path of the Asset construct, with respect to the enclosing stack. If the asset is produced by a construct helper function (such as ``lambda.Code.fromAsset()``), this will look like ``MyFunction/Code``. We use the stack-relative construct path so that in the common case where you have multiple stacks with the same asset, we won't show something like ``/MyBetaStack/MyFunction/Code`` when you are actually deploying to production. Default: - Stack-relative construct path
        :param readers: A list of principals that should be able to read this asset from S3. You can use ``asset.grantRead(principal)`` to grant read permissions later. Default: - No principals that can read file asset.
        :param source_kms_key: The ARN of the KMS key used to encrypt the handler code. Default: - the default server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys(SSE-S3) key will be used.
        :param asset_hash: Specify a custom hash for this asset. If ``assetHashType`` is set it must be set to ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``. For consistency, this custom hash will be SHA256 hashed and encoded as hex. The resulting hash will be the asset hash. NOTE: the hash is used in order to identify a specific revision of the asset, and used for optimizing and caching deployment activities related to this asset such as packaging, uploading to Amazon S3, etc. If you chose to customize the hash, you will need to make sure it is updated every time the asset changes, or otherwise it is possible that some deployments will not be invalidated. Default: - based on ``assetHashType``
        :param asset_hash_type: Specifies the type of hash to calculate for this asset. If ``assetHash`` is configured, this option must be ``undefined`` or ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``. Default: - the default is ``AssetHashType.SOURCE``, but if ``assetHash`` is explicitly specified this value defaults to ``AssetHashType.CUSTOM``.
        :param bundling: Bundle the asset by executing a command in a Docker container or a custom bundling provider. The asset path will be mounted at ``/asset-input``. The Docker container is responsible for putting content at ``/asset-output``. The content at ``/asset-output`` will be zipped and used as the final asset. Default: - uploaded as-is to S3 if the asset is a regular file or a .zip file, archived into a .zip file and uploaded to S3 otherwise
        :param exclude: File paths matching the patterns will be excluded. See ``ignoreMode`` to set the matching behavior. Has no effect on Assets bundled using the ``bundling`` property. Default: - nothing is excluded
        :param follow_symlinks: A strategy for how to handle symlinks. Default: SymlinkFollowMode.NEVER
        :param ignore_mode: The ignore behavior to use for ``exclude`` patterns. Default: IgnoreMode.GLOB

To calculate the total number of processes in a runtime configuration, add the values of the ConcurrentExecutions parameter for each ServerProcess.
        :param description: (experimental) A human-readable description of the fleet. Default: - no description is provided
        :param desired_capacity: (experimental) The number of EC2 instances that you want this fleet to host. When creating a new fleet, GameLift automatically sets this value to "1" and initiates a single instance. Once the fleet is active, update this value to trigger GameLift to add or remove instances from the fleet. Default: - Default capacity is 0
        :param locations: (experimental) A set of remote locations to deploy additional instances to and manage as part of the fleet. This parameter can only be used when creating fleets in AWS Regions that support multiple locations. You can add any GameLift-supported AWS Region as a remote location, in the form of an AWS Region code such as ``us-west-2``. To create a fleet with instances in the home region only, omit this parameter. Default: - Create a fleet with instances in the home region only
        :param max_size: (experimental) The maximum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet location. Default: 1
        :param metric_group: (experimental) The name of an AWS CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. A metric group is used to aggregate the metrics for multiple fleets. You can specify an existing metric group name or set a new name to create a new metric group. A fleet can be included in only one metric group at a time. Default: - Fleet metrics are aggregated with other fleets in the default metric group
        :param min_size: (experimental) The minimum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet location. Default: 0
        :param peer_vpc: (experimental) A VPC peering connection between your GameLift-hosted game servers and your other non-GameLift resources. Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering connections to enable your game servers to communicate directly and privately with your other AWS resources, such as a web service or a repository. You can establish VPC peering with any resources that run on AWS and are managed by an AWS account that you have access to. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. Warning: Be sure to create a VPC Peering authorization through Gamelift Service API. Default: - no vpc peering
        :param protect_new_game_session: (experimental) The status of termination protection for active game sessions on the fleet. By default, new game sessions are protected and cannot be terminated during a scale-down event. Default: true - Game sessions in ``ACTIVE`` status cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
        :param resource_creation_limit_policy: (experimental) A policy that limits the number of game sessions that an individual player can create on instances in this fleet within a specified span of time. Default: - No resource creation limit policy
        :param role: (experimental) The IAM role assumed by GameLift fleet instances to access AWS ressources. With a role set, any application that runs on an instance in this fleet can assume the role, including install scripts, server processes, and daemons (background processes). If providing a custom role, it needs to trust the GameLift service principal (gamelift.amazonaws.com). No permission is required by default. This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created. Default: - a role will be created with default trust to Gamelift service principal.
        :param use_certificate: (experimental) Prompts GameLift to generate a TLS/SSL certificate for the fleet. GameLift uses the certificates to encrypt traffic between game clients and the game servers running on GameLift. You can't change this property after you create the fleet. Additionnal info: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates expire after 13 months. Certificate expiration can cause fleets to fail, preventing players from connecting to instances in the fleet. We recommend you replace fleets before 13 months, consider using fleet aliases for a smooth transition. Default: - TLS/SSL certificate are generated for the fleet
        :param use_spot: (experimental) Indicates whether to use On-Demand or Spot instances for this fleet. By default, fleet use on demand capacity. This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created. Default: - Gamelift fleet use on demand capacity

    '''(experimental) Creates a GameLift FleetIQ game server group for managing game hosting on a collection of Amazon EC2 instances for game hosting.

    This operation creates the game server group, creates an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account, and establishes a link between the two groups.
    You can view the status of your game server groups in the GameLift console.
    Game server group metrics and events are emitted to Amazon CloudWatch.
    Before creating a new game server group, you must have the following:

    - An Amazon EC2 launch template that specifies how to launch Amazon EC2 instances with your game server build.
    - An IAM role that extends limited access to your AWS account to allow GameLift FleetIQ to create and interact with the Auto Scaling group.

    To create a new game server group, specify a unique group name, IAM role and Amazon EC2 launch template, and provide a list of instance types that can be used in the group.
    You must also set initial maximum and minimum limits on the group's instance count.
    You can optionally set an Auto Scaling policy with target tracking based on a GameLift FleetIQ metric.

    Once the game server group and corresponding Auto Scaling group are created, you have full access to change the Auto Scaling group's configuration as needed.
    Several properties that are set when creating a game server group, including maximum/minimum size and auto-scaling policy settings, must be updated directly in the Auto Scaling group.
    Keep in mind that some Auto Scaling group properties are periodically updated by GameLift FleetIQ as part of its balancing activities to optimize for availability and cost.

        :param launch_template: (experimental) The Amazon EC2 launch template that contains configuration settings and game server code to be deployed to all instances in the game server group. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs. NOTE: If you specify network interfaces in your launch template, you must explicitly set the property AssociatePublicIpAddress to ``true``. If no network interface is specified in the launch template, GameLift FleetIQ uses your account's default VPC.
        :param vpc: (experimental) The VPC network to place the game server group in. By default, all GameLift FleetIQ-supported Availability Zones are used. You can use this parameter to specify VPCs that you've set up. This property cannot be updated after the game server group is created, and the corresponding Auto Scaling group will always use the property value that is set with this request, even if the Auto Scaling group is updated directly.
        :param auto_scaling_policy: (experimental) Configuration settings to define a scaling policy for the Auto Scaling group that is optimized for game hosting. The scaling policy uses the metric ``PercentUtilizedGameServers`` to maintain a buffer of idle game servers that can immediately accommodate new games and players. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs. Default: no autoscaling policy settled

        :param max_size: (experimental) The maximum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and EC2 do not scale up the group above this maximum. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs. Default: the default is 1
        :param min_size: (experimental) The minimum number of instances allowed in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group. During automatic scaling events, GameLift FleetIQ and Amazon EC2 do not scale down the group below this minimum. In production, this value should be set to at least 1. After the Auto Scaling group is created, update this value directly in the Auto Scaling group using the AWS console or APIs. Default: the default is 0
        :param protect_game_server: (experimental) A flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion. An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status. Default: game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event
        :param role: (experimental) The IAM role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups. Default: - a role will be created with default trust to Gamelift and Autoscaling service principal with a default policy ``GameLiftGameServerGroupPolicy`` attached.

    Fleet designations tell GameLift where to search for available resources when creating new game sessions for players.
    Use aliases instead of specific fleet IDs to seamlessly switch player traffic from one fleet to another by changing the alias's target location.

    Aliases are useful in games that don't use queues.
    Switching fleets in a queue is a simple matter of creating a new fleet, adding it to the queue, and removing the old fleet, none of which is visible to players.
    In contrast, game clients that don't use queues must specify which fleet to use when communicating with the GameLift service.
    Without aliases, a fleet switch requires updates to your game code and possibly distribution of an updated game clients to players.

    When updating the fleet-id an alias points to, there is a transition period of up to 2 minutes where game sessions on the alias may end up on the old fleet.

    For example, you can use Spot Instance fleets configured with your preferred locations, along with a backup On-Demand Instance fleet with the same locations.

        :param scope: -
        :param id: -
        :param content: (experimental) A build to be deployed on the fleet. The build must have been successfully uploaded to Amazon GameLift and be in a ``READY`` status. This fleet setting cannot be changed once the fleet is created.
        :param ingress_rules: (experimental) The allowed IP address ranges and port settings that allow inbound traffic to access game sessions on this fleet. This property must be set before players can connect to game sessions. Default: no inbound traffic allowed
        :param fleet_name: (experimental) A descriptive label that is associated with a fleet. Fleet names do not need to be unique.
        :param instance_type: (experimental) The GameLift-supported Amazon EC2 instance type to use for all fleet instances. Instance type determines the computing resources that will be used to host your game servers, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity.
        :param runtime_configuration: (experimental) A collection of server process configurations that describe the set of processes to run on each instance in a fleet. Server processes run either an executable in a custom game build or a Realtime Servers script. GameLift launches the configured processes, manages their life cycle, and replaces them as needed. Each instance checks regularly for an updated runtime configuration. A GameLift instance is limited to 50 processes running concurrently. To calculate the total number of processes in a runtime configuration, add the values of the ConcurrentExecutions parameter for each ServerProcess.
        :param description: (experimental) A human-readable description of the fleet. Default: - no description is provided
        :param desired_capacity: (experimental) The number of EC2 instances that you want this fleet to host. When creating a new fleet, GameLift automatically sets this value to "1" and initiates a single instance. Once the fleet is active, update this value to trigger GameLift to add or remove instances from the fleet. Default: - Default capacity is 0
        :param locations: (experimental) A set of remote locations to deploy additional instances to and manage as part of the fleet. This parameter can only be used when creating fleets in AWS Regions that support multiple locations. You can add any GameLift-supported AWS Region as a remote location, in the form of an AWS Region code such as ``us-west-2``. To create a fleet with instances in the home region only, omit this parameter. Default: - Create a fleet with instances in the home region only
        :param max_size: (experimental) The maximum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet location. Default: 1
        :param metric_group: (experimental) The name of an AWS CloudWatch metric group to add this fleet to. A metric group is used to aggregate the metrics for multiple fleets. You can specify an existing metric group name or set a new name to create a new metric group. A fleet can be included in only one metric group at a time. Default: - Fleet metrics are aggregated with other fleets in the default metric group
        :param min_size: (experimental) The minimum number of instances that are allowed in the specified fleet location. Default: 0
        :param peer_vpc: (experimental) A VPC peering connection between your GameLift-hosted game servers and your other non-GameLift resources. Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) peering connections to enable your game servers to communicate directly and privately with your other AWS resources, such as a web service or a repository. You can establish VPC peering with any resources that run on AWS and are managed by an AWS account that you have access to. The VPC must be in the same Region as your fleet. Warning: Be sure to create a VPC Peering authorization through Gamelift Service API. Default: - no vpc peering
        :param protect_new_game_session: (experimental) The status of termination protection for active game sessions on the fleet. By default, new game sessions are protected and cannot be terminated during a scale-down event. Default: true - Game sessions in ``ACTIVE`` status cannot be terminated during a scale-down event.
        :param resource_creation_limit_policy: (experimental) A policy that limits the number of game sessions that an individual player can create on instances in this fleet within a specified span of time. Default: - No resource creation limit policy
        :param role: (experimental) The IAM role assumed by GameLift fleet instances to access AWS ressources. With a role set, any application that runs on an instance in this fleet can assume the role, including install scripts, server processes, and daemons (background processes). If providing a custom role, it needs to trust the GameLift service principal (gamelift.amazonaws.com). No permission is required by default. This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created. Default: - a role will be created with default trust to Gamelift service principal.
        :param use_certificate: (experimental) Prompts GameLift to generate a TLS/SSL certificate for the fleet. GameLift uses the certificates to encrypt traffic between game clients and the game servers running on GameLift. You can't change this property after you create the fleet. Additionnal info: AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates expire after 13 months. Certificate expiration can cause fleets to fail, preventing players from connecting to instances in the fleet. We recommend you replace fleets before 13 months, consider using fleet aliases for a smooth transition. Default: - TLS/SSL certificate are generated for the fleet
        :param use_spot: (experimental) Indicates whether to use On-Demand or Spot instances for this fleet. By default, fleet use on demand capacity. This property cannot be changed after the fleet is created. Default: - Gamelift fleet use on demand capacity
