The insurance policy provides comprehensive coverage including death benefits, illness coverage, hospitalization benefits, and surgical expense coverage. In addition to these core benefits, the policy also includes optional riders for critical illness, disability income, and long-term care. The policyholder may choose to add or remove these riders at any time during the policy term, subject to underwriting approval. Premium payments can be made monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually, with discounts available for annual payment modes.",
        "Furthermore, the policy includes a waiver of premium benefit in case of total disability, meaning that if the insured becomes totally disabled and unable to work, the insurance company will waive all future premium payments while keeping the coverage in force. This benefit typically requires proof of disability from a licensed physician and may be subject to a waiting period of 90 to 180 days depending on the specific policy terms and conditions."
