# FoundryTools-CLI

FoundryTools-CLI is a command line interface for the
[FoundryTools](https://github.com/ftCLI/FoundryTools) library, which provides a set of tools for
working with font files. It is designed to be used from the command line, allowing users to perform
various operations on font files without the need for a graphical user interface.

The CLI provides a range of commands for manipulating font files, including converting between
different font formats, extracting and modifying font metadata, and performing various font-related
operations. It is built on top of the FoundryTools library, which provides a comprehensive set of
tools for working with font files in Python.

The CLI is designed to be easy to use and provides a consistent interface for working with different
font formats. It is suitable for both developers and font designers who need to perform various
operations on font files from the command line. The CLI is also extensible, allowing users to add
their own commands and functionality as needed.

The command line interface is built with [click](https://github.com/pallets/click/) and tables are
rendered by [rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich).
