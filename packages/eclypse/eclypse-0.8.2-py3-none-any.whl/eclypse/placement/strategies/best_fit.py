"""Module for a Best Fit placement strategy.

It overrides the `place` method of the
PlacementStrategy class to place services of an application on infrastructure nodes
based on the node that best fits the requirements of the service (i.e., the node that
satisfies the requirements and has the least amount of resources left after the placement).
