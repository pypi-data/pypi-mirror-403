"""The module for computing Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) association metric.

This module provides functionality for computing the similarity score between detection reports
and Kalman filter states (targets) using the Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) metric.
The metric is computed between the 3D bounding boxes which are aligned with Cartesian axes.

The resulting rectangular matrix will have a shape of (num_reports, num_targets), and located
at the beginning of the pre-allocated buffer `metric_rt` of the base class `MetricDriverBase`.
The resulting matrix is contiguous in memory.

Classes:
    MetricGIoUAligned: Computes GIoU-based association metrics between detections
        and Kalman filter states in aligned coordinate space.
