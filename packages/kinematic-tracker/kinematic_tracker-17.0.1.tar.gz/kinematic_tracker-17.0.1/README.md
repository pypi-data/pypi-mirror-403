# Kinematic Tracker

📖 Live docs: https://kovalp.github.io/kinematic-tracker-docs/

This tracker is based on kinematic Kalman filters. The system state can consist of multiple parts,
each defined by its *kinematic order* and *dimensionality*. For example, to track cuboids
aligned with Cartesian axes, we might decide for a constant-acceleration motion model
for Cartesian coordinates and a constant-position motion model for the sizes of the cuboids.
This choice encoded by `orders = [3, 1]`. The dimensionality of both parts (coordinates and sizes)
is `3`. Therefore `dimensions = [3, 3]` in our example.

The state of the cuboids aligned with Cartesian axis will have 12 variables.
Internally, a block-diagonal states are used, i.e.

```state = p_x, v_x, a_x, p_y, v_y, a_y, p_z, v_z, a_z, s_x, s_y, s_z```

To simplify the input/output processing, one might find attractive a derivative-sorted order

```state = p_x, p_y, p_z, s_x, s_y, s_z, v_x, v_y, v_z, a_x, a_y, a_z```

This package provides utility classes for such conversion (block-diagonal ↔ derivative sorted).

## Process noise models

The tracker supports various process noise models, including a custom adaptive process noise model
based on a white-noise assumption.

## Association metrics

A number of association metrics are implemented. Some of the metrics are experimental.

  - Mahalanobis with a process-measurement noise sum covariance (HPH + R) -- **default**.
  - 3D axes-aligned GIoU (volumetric GIoU for cuboids).
  - Mahalanobis with size-modulated covariance (experimental)
  - A dimension-averaged GIoU (experimental)
