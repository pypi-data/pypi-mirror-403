  - Improve typing hints in the method `NdKkfTracker.advance()`.

# 15.7.1

  - Improve the definition of the dependencies to avoid compilation on Python 3.14


# 15.7.0

  - Introduce generator of measurement vectors in `MetricDriverBase` class.
  - Precompute the GIoU auxiliaries in aligned GIoU driver.
  - Setter for the max number of reports and targets.
  - Suggest a dimension-averaged GIoU association metric.

# 15.0.1

  - Using the package `association-quality-clavia`.
  - Published in PyPI registry.

# 14.2.0

  - Using the package `binary-classification-ratios`.

# 14.1.2

  - Compatibility with nuScenes @ `evaluation-against-nuscenes` (Python >=3.10 & NumPy >=1.26.4).

# 14.1.0

  - Added an association-threshold setter in `NdKkfTracker`.

# 14.0.1

  - Corrected the example of tracking with yaw angle affected by the version 14.
  - Made the example of tracking association quality more robust.

# 14.0.0
    
This version bump is major because it breaks a silent convention on the distribution 
of variables in the measurement vector. In previous versions, the measurement vector
has been distributed as follows:

     $$z^T = (p_x, p_y, p_z, s_x, s_y, s_z, ...)$$

In this version, the distribution of variables in the measurement vector is as follows:

     $$z^T = (p_x, p_y, p_z, ..., s_x, s_y, s_z)$$

where the position variables are listed first, followed by the size variables.
This change makes the tracker more convenient to use with ASAM OpenLabel frames.

  - Possibility to adjust the distribution of variables in the measurement vector.
  - Added setter `NdKkfTracker.set_ind_pos_size`.

# 13.0.1
    
  - Proofread the README file.
  - Renamed `gen_z` --> `gen_xz` in tracker.

# 12.1.0

  - Remove the unfinished `GIoUWithYaw` class.
  - Add all non-trivial docstrings.
  - Eliminate the flip in Greedy matching.
  - Eliminate unused buffer in the Mahalanobis metric driver.
  - Remove the obsolete method `NdKkfTrack.get_det_cov()`. 

# 12.0.0

  - All dependencies are public from PyPI.

# 11.1.2

  - Add docstrings in `nd` modules
  - Use documented version of the kinematic-matrix package (viulib-kinematic-matrices>=0.3.0)


# 11.1.0

  - Allow both `int` and `np.int64` to be used as time stamps in the `Tracker.advance` method.
  - Add three tutorial examples:
    - tracking of cuboids aligned with Cartesian axes
    - tracking of cuboids with yaw angle
    - tracking and classifying the association quality

# 11.0.0

  - Introduced the (bipartite) matching drivers:
    - Maximal shape of the metric is rectangular
    - The returned match is in fixed-size numpy arrays which stay the same across time stamps
    - Auxiliary buffers are used instead of temporary (scrap) RAM
  - Remove the calculation of threshold from the association probability 

# 10.4.0

  - Added nuScenes example
  - Refactored the metric drivers:
    - Maximal shape of the metric is rectangular
    - Metric is computed in a chunk of memory at the beginning of the rectangular buffer
    - The returned matrix is rectangular, local and shares memory with the buffer
    - Removed O(N) buffers for $Hx$ and $HPH^T$
    - The order of indices is (reports, targets) resulting in wide matrices most of the time
    - Auxiliary buffers are used instead of temporary (scrap) RAM
