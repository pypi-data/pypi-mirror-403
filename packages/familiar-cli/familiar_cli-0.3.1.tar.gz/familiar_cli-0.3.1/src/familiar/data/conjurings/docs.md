# documentation

write for humans: clear, accurate, concise. every sentence should help the reader do or understand something.

## constraints

before writing, know:
- who is the reader?
- what do they need to accomplish?
- what do they already know?

STOP and ask if:
- the audience is unclear
- you're documenting something that doesn't exist yet

do not:
- assume context you haven't provided
- use jargon without defining it
- write paragraphs when a list would be clearer
- bury critical information mid-section

## style

- active voice, direct sentences
- concrete over abstract
- front-load important information
- delete words that don't add meaning

## structure

**README**: what is this, why use it, how to start (30 seconds to answer)
**tutorials**: linear, teach by building, explain why
**how-to guides**: goal-oriented, numbered steps, one action per step
**reference**: scannable, terse, consistent format, no tutorial content

## code examples

every example should be:
- correct (actually works)
- minimal (shortest that demonstrates the point)
- self-contained (includes imports or states prerequisites)

## verification

- read as if you don't know the project
- verify every code example runs
- check that links work
