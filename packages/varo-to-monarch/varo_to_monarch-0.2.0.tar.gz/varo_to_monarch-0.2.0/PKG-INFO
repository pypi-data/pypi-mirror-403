# Varo to Monarch

Convert Varo Bank PDF statements to Monarch Money CSV format with ease. No more
manual data entry - just point the tool at your Varo statements and get a
Monarch-ready CSV file in seconds.

## Features

- 📄 **Hybrid PDF Extraction**: Uses PyMuPDF for table-based extraction and
  pdfplumber for text-based parsing to capture all transactions
- 🔄 **Parallel Processing**: Process multiple PDFs concurrently with
  customizable worker count for faster conversions
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Rich progress bars show real-time conversion status
  for each file
- 💰 **Smart Amount Handling**: Automatically applies correct sign
  transformations per transaction section (purchases are negative, payments are
  positive, etc.)
- 🎯 **Intelligent Section Detection**: Accurately identifies and categorizes
  Purchases, Payments/Credits, Fees, and Secured Account transactions
- 🏦 **Account Mapping**: Automatically maps transactions to correct accounts
  (Varo Believe Card vs Varo Secured Account)
- 📝 **Monarch-Ready Output**: Generates CSV files with the exact format
  required by Monarch Money import
- 🚀 **No External Dependencies**: Pure Python implementation with no
  Ghostscript or system dependencies required

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install varo-to-monarch
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blacksuan19/varo-to-monarch.git
cd varo-to-monarch
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Convert all PDFs in a folder:

```bash
vtm path/to/statements
```

This will:

1. Find all PDF files in the specified directory
2. Extract transactions from each statement
3. Combine them into a single CSV file:
   `path/to/statements/varo_monarch_combined.csv`

### Advanced Options

**Custom output file:**

```bash
vtm path/to/statements --output path/to/output.csv
```

**Filter specific PDFs:**

```bash
vtm path/to/statements --pattern "2024*.pdf"
```

**Parallel processing (faster for multiple files):**

```bash
vtm path/to/statements --workers 4
```

**Exclude source filename column:**

```bash
vtm path/to/statements --no-include-source-file
```

**Get help:**

```bash
vtm --help
```

## Output Format

The generated CSV contains the following columns:

- **Date**: Transaction date (MM/DD/YYYY format)
- **Merchant Name**: Transaction description
- **Account**: Either "Varo Believe Card" or "Varo Secured Account"
- **Amount**: Transaction amount (negative for purchases/fees, positive for
  payments/credits)
- **SourceFile**: Original PDF filename (optional, can be excluded with
  `--no-include-source-file`)

## How It Works

The tool uses a hybrid extraction strategy:

1. **Table Extraction (PyMuPDF)**: Detects and extracts transaction tables for
   structured data
2. **Text Parsing (pdfplumber)**: Fallback method for transactions that table
   detection misses
3. **Smart Deduplication**: Removes duplicate extractions while preserving
   legitimate duplicate transactions
4. **Section-Based Classification**: Assigns correct account and sign based on
   transaction type:
   - **Purchases**: Negative amounts → Varo Believe Card
   - **Fees**: Negative amounts → Varo Believe Card
   - **Payments and Credits**: Positive amounts → Varo Believe Card
   - **Secured Account Transactions**: Based on description patterns → Varo
     Secured Account

## Supported Transaction Types

### Varo Believe Card

- Credit card purchases
- Fees and charges
- Payments and credits

### Varo Secured Account

- Transfers from Secured Account to Believe Card
- Transfers from Secured Account to Checking Account (DDA)
- Deposits into Secured Account (e.g., "Move Your Pay")

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Internet connection for initial package installation

## Troubleshooting

**No transactions extracted:**

- Ensure your PDFs are actual Varo Bank statements
- Check that PDFs are not password-protected or corrupted

**Missing some transactions:**

- The tool automatically handles multi-page statements
- Try running with `--workers 1` to rule out concurrency issues

**Incorrect amounts or accounts:**

- File an issue on GitHub with a sample (redacted) statement

## Development
