## Introduction

Bouquin ("Book-ahn") is a notebook and planner application written in Python, Qt and SQLCipher.

It is designed to treat each day as its own 'page', complete with Markdown rendering, tagging,
search, reminders and time logging for those of us who need to keep track of not just TODOs, but
also how long we spent on them.

For those who rely on that time logging for work, there is also an Invoicing feature that can
generate invoices of that time spent.

There is also support for embedding documents in a file manager.

It uses SQLCipher as a drop-in replacement for SQLite3.

This means that the underlying database for the notebook is encrypted at rest.

To increase security, the SQLCipher key is requested when the app is opened, and is not written
to disk unless the user configures it to be in the settings.

There is deliberately no network connectivity or syncing intended, other than the option to send a bug
report from within the app, or optionally to check for new versions to upgrade to.

## How to install

Unless you are using the Debian option below:

 * Make sure you have `libxcb-cursor0` installed (on Debian-based distributions) or `xcb-util-cursor` (RedHat/Fedora-based distributions).
 * If downloading from my Forgejo's Releases page, you may wish to verify the GPG signatures with my [GPG key](https://mig5.net/static/mig5.asc).

### Debian 13 ('Trixie')

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://mig5.net/static/mig5.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/mig5.gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mig5.gpg] https://apt.mig5.net $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mig5.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install bouquin
```

### Fedora 42

```bash
sudo rpm --import https://mig5.net/static/mig5.asc

sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/mig5.repo > /dev/null << 'EOF'
[mig5]
