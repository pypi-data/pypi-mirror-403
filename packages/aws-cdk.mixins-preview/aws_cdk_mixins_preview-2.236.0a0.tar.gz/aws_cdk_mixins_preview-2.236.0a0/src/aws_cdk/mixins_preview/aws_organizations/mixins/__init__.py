class CfnAccountPropsMixin(

    metaclass=jsii.JSIIMeta,
    jsii_type="@aws-cdk/mixins-preview.aws_organizations.mixins.CfnAccountPropsMixin",
):
    '''Creates an AWS account that is automatically a member of the organization whose credentials made the request.

    CloudFormation uses the ```CreateAccount`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_CreateAccount.html>`_ operation to create accounts. This is an asynchronous request that AWS performs in the background. Because ``CreateAccount`` operates asynchronously, it can return a successful completion message even though account initialization might still be in progress. You might need to wait a few minutes before you can successfully access the account. To check the status of the request, do one of the following:

    - Use the ``Id`` value of the ``CreateAccountStatus`` response element from the ``CreateAccount`` operation to provide as a parameter to the ```DescribeCreateAccountStatus`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCreateAccountStatus.html>`_ operation.
    - Check the CloudTrail log for the ``CreateAccountResult`` event. For information on using CloudTrail with AWS Organizations , see `Logging and monitoring in AWS Organizations <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_security_incident-response.html#orgs_cloudtrail-integration>`_ in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .

    The user who calls the API to create an account must have the ``organizations:CreateAccount`` permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, AWS Organizations creates the required service-linked role named ``AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations`` . For more information, see `AWS Organizations and service-linked roles <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_services.html#orgs_integrate_services-using_slrs>`_ in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .

    If the request includes tags, then the requester must have the ``organizations:TagResource`` permission.

    AWS Organizations preconfigures the new member account with a role (named ``OrganizationAccountAccessRole`` by default) that grants users in the management account administrator permissions in the new member account. Principals in the management account can assume the role. AWS Organizations clones the company name and address information for the new account from the organization's management account.

    For more information about creating accounts, see `Creating a member account in your organization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html>`_ in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .

    This operation can be called only from the organization's management account.

    *Deleting Account resources*

    The default ``DeletionPolicy`` for resource ``AWS::Organizations::Account`` is ``Retain`` . For more information about how CloudFormation deletes resources, see `DeletionPolicy Attribute <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-deletionpolicy.html>`_ .
    .. epigraph::

       - If you include multiple accounts in a single template, you must use the ``DependsOn`` attribute on each account resource type so that the accounts are created sequentially. If you create multiple accounts at the same time, Organizations returns an error and the stack operation fails.
       - You can't modify the following list of ``Account`` resource parameters using CloudFormation updates.
       - AccountName
       - Email
       - RoleName

       If you attempt to update the listed parameters, CloudFormation will attempt the update, but you will receive an error message as those updates are not supported from an Organizations management account or a `registered delegated administrator <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/stacksets-orgs-delegated-admin.html>`_ account. Both the update and the update roll-back will fail, so you must skip the account resource update. To update parameters ``AccountName`` and ``Email`` , you must sign in to the AWS Management Console as the AWS account root user. For more information, see `Update the AWS account name, email address, or password for the root user <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-update-root-user.html>`_ in the *Account Management Reference Guide* .

       - When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or AWS CLI commands, we don't automatically collect the information required for the account to operate as a standalone account. That includes collecting the payment method and signing the end user license agreement (EULA). If you must remove an account from your organization later, you can do so only after you provide the missing information. For more information, see `Considerations before removing an account from an organization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_account-before-remove.html>`_ in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .
       - When you create an account in an organization using CloudFormation , you can't specify a value for the ``CreateAccount`` operation parameter ``IamUserAccessToBilling`` . The default value for parameter ``IamUserAccessToBilling`` is ``ALLOW`` , and IAM users and roles with the required permissions can access billing information for the new account.
       - If you get an exception that indicates ``DescribeCreateAccountStatus returns IN_PROGRESS state before time out`` . You must check the account creation status using the ```DescribeCreateAccountStatus`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeCreateAccountStatus.html>`_ operation. If the account state returns as ``SUCCEEDED`` , you can import the account into CloudFormation management using ```resource import`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/resource-import.html>`_ .
       - If you get an exception that indicates you have exceeded your account quota for the organization, you can request an increase by using the `Service Quotas console <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_reference_limits.html>`_ .
       - If you get an exception that indicates the operation failed because your organization is still initializing, wait one hour and then try again. If the error persists, contact `AWS Support <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/>`_ .
       - We don't recommend that you use the ``CreateAccount`` operation to create multiple temporary accounts. You can close accounts using the ```CloseAccount`` <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/APIReference/API_CloseAccount.html>`_ operation or from the AWS Organizations console in the organization's management account. For information on the requirements and process for closing an account, see `Closing a member account in your organization <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_close.html>`_ in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .

       - You can delete an organization only after you remove all member accounts from the organization. If you created some of your member accounts using AWS Organizations , you might be blocked from removing those accounts. You can remove a member account only if it has all the information that's required to operate as a standalone AWS account. For more information about how to provide that information and then remove the account, see `Leave an organization from your member account <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_leave-as-member.html>`_ in the *AWS Organizations User Guide* .
