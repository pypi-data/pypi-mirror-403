        :param policy_document: Specify the policy, in JSON. *Data protection policy* A data protection policy must include two JSON blocks: - The first block must include both a ``DataIdentifer`` array and an ``Operation`` property with an ``Audit`` action. The ``DataIdentifer`` array lists the types of sensitive data that you want to mask. For more information about the available options, see `Types of data that you can mask <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data-types.html>`_ . The ``Operation`` property with an ``Audit`` action is required to find the sensitive data terms. This ``Audit`` action must contain a ``FindingsDestination`` object. You can optionally use that ``FindingsDestination`` object to list one or more destinations to send audit findings to. If you specify destinations such as log groups, Firehose streams, and S3 buckets, they must already exist. - The second block must include both a ``DataIdentifer`` array and an ``Operation`` property with an ``Deidentify`` action. The ``DataIdentifer`` array must exactly match the ``DataIdentifer`` array in the first block of the policy. The ``Operation`` property with the ``Deidentify`` action is what actually masks the data, and it must contain the ``"MaskConfig": {}`` object. The ``"MaskConfig": {}`` object must be empty. .. epigraph:: The contents of the two ``DataIdentifer`` arrays must match exactly. In addition to the two JSON blocks, the ``policyDocument`` can also include ``Name`` , ``Description`` , and ``Version`` fields. The ``Name`` is different than the operation's ``policyName`` parameter, and is used as a dimension when CloudWatch Logs reports audit findings metrics to CloudWatch . The JSON specified in ``policyDocument`` can be up to 30,720 characters long. *Subscription filter policy* A subscription filter policy can include the following attributes in a JSON block: - *DestinationArn* The ARN of the destination to deliver log events to. Supported destinations are: - An Kinesis Data Streams data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery. - An Firehose data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery. - A Lambda function in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery. - A logical destination in a different account created with `PutDestination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestination.html>`_ , for cross-account delivery. Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose are supported as logical destinations. - *RoleArn* The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch Logs permissions to deliver ingested log events to the destination stream. You don't need to provide the ARN when you are working with a logical destination for cross-account delivery. - *FilterPattern* A filter pattern for subscribing to a filtered stream of log events. - *Distribution* The method used to distribute log data to the destination. By default, log data is grouped by log stream, but the grouping can be set to ``Random`` for a more even distribution. This property is only applicable when the destination is an Kinesis Data Streams data stream. *Field index policy* A field index filter policy can include the following attribute in a JSON block: - *Fields* The array of field indexes to create. The following is an example of an index policy document that creates two indexes, ``RequestId`` and ``TransactionId`` . ``"policyDocument": "{ \\"Fields\\": [ \\"RequestId\\", \\"TransactionId\\" ] }"`` *Transformer policy* A transformer policy must include one JSON block with the array of processors and their configurations. For more information about available processors, see `Processors that you can use <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation.html#CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation-Processors>`_ .
        :param policy_name: A name for the policy. This must be unique within the account.
        :param policy_type: The type of policy that you're creating or updating.
        :param scope: Currently the only valid value for this parameter is ``ALL`` , which specifies that the policy applies to all log groups in the account. If you omit this parameter, the default of ``ALL`` is used. To scope down a subscription filter policy to a subset of log groups, use the ``SelectionCriteria`` parameter.
        :param selection_criteria: Use this parameter to apply the new policy to a subset of log groups in the account. You need to specify ``SelectionCriteria`` only when you specify ``SUBSCRIPTION_FILTER_POLICY`` , ``FIELD_INDEX_POLICY`` or ``TRANSFORMER_POLICY`` for ``PolicyType`` . If ``PolicyType`` is ``SUBSCRIPTION_FILTER_POLICY`` , the only supported ``SelectionCriteria`` filter is ``LogGroupName NOT IN []`` If ``PolicyType`` is ``FIELD_INDEX_POLICY`` or ``TRANSFORMER_POLICY`` , the only supported ``SelectionCriteria`` filter is ``LogGroupNamePrefix`` The ``SelectionCriteria`` string can be up to 25KB in length. The length is determined by using its UTF-8 bytes. Using the ``SelectionCriteria`` parameter with ``SUBSCRIPTION_FILTER_POLICY`` is useful to help prevent infinite loops.

        - The second block must include both a ``DataIdentifer`` array and an ``Operation`` property with an ``Deidentify`` action. The ``DataIdentifer`` array must exactly match the ``DataIdentifer`` array in the first block of the policy.

        The ``Operation`` property with the ``Deidentify`` action is what actually masks the data, and it must contain the ``"MaskConfig": {}`` object. The ``"MaskConfig": {}`` object must be empty.
        .. epigraph::

           The contents of the two ``DataIdentifer`` arrays must match exactly.

        In addition to the two JSON blocks, the ``policyDocument`` can also include ``Name`` , ``Description`` , and ``Version`` fields. The ``Name`` is different than the operation's ``policyName`` parameter, and is used as a dimension when CloudWatch Logs reports audit findings metrics to CloudWatch .

        The JSON specified in ``policyDocument`` can be up to 30,720 characters long.

        *Subscription filter policy*

        A subscription filter policy can include the following attributes in a JSON block:

        - *DestinationArn* The ARN of the destination to deliver log events to. Supported destinations are:
        - An Kinesis Data Streams data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.
        - An Firehose data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.
        - A Lambda function in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.
        - A logical destination in a different account created with `PutDestination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestination.html>`_ , for cross-account delivery. Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose are supported as logical destinations.
        - *RoleArn* The ARN of an IAM role that grants CloudWatch Logs permissions to deliver ingested log events to the destination stream. You don't need to provide the ARN when you are working with a logical destination for cross-account delivery.
        - *FilterPattern* A filter pattern for subscribing to a filtered stream of log events.
        - *Distribution* The method used to distribute log data to the destination. By default, log data is grouped by log stream, but the grouping can be set to ``Random`` for a more even distribution. This property is only applicable when the destination is an Kinesis Data Streams data stream.

        *Field index policy*

    '''Creates or updates an account-level data protection policy or subscription filter policy that applies to all log groups or a subset of log groups in the account.

    *Data protection policy*

    A data protection policy can help safeguard sensitive data that's ingested by your log groups by auditing and masking the sensitive log data. Each account can have only one account-level data protection policy.
    .. epigraph::

       Sensitive data is detected and masked when it is ingested into a log group. When you set a data protection policy, log events ingested into the log groups before that time are not masked.

    If you create a data protection policy for your whole account, it applies to both existing log groups and all log groups that are created later in this account. The account policy is applied to existing log groups with eventual consistency. It might take up to 5 minutes before sensitive data in existing log groups begins to be masked.

    By default, when a user views a log event that includes masked data, the sensitive data is replaced by asterisks. A user who has the ``logs:Unmask`` permission can use a `GetLogEvents <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_GetLogEvents.html>`_ or `FilterLogEvents <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_FilterLogEvents.html>`_ operation with the ``unmask`` parameter set to ``true`` to view the unmasked log events. Users with the ``logs:Unmask`` can also view unmasked data in the CloudWatch Logs console by running a CloudWatch Logs Insights query with the ``unmask`` query command.

    For more information, including a list of types of data that can be audited and masked, see `Protect sensitive log data with masking <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/mask-sensitive-log-data.html>`_ .

    To create an account-level policy, you must be signed on with the ``logs:PutDataProtectionPolicy`` and ``logs:PutAccountPolicy`` permissions.

    An account-level policy applies to all log groups in the account. You can also create a data protection policy that applies to just one log group. If a log group has its own data protection policy and the account also has an account-level data protection policy, then the two policies are cumulative. Any sensitive term specified in either policy is masked.

    *Subscription filter policy*

    A subscription filter policy sets up a real-time feed of log events from CloudWatch Logs to other AWS services. Account-level subscription filter policies apply to both existing log groups and log groups that are created later in this account. Supported destinations are Kinesis Data Streams , Firehose , and Lambda . When log events are sent to the receiving service, they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the GZIP format.

    The following destinations are supported for subscription filters:

    - An Kinesis Data Streams data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.
    - An Firehose data stream in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.
    - A Lambda function in the same account as the subscription policy, for same-account delivery.
    - A logical destination in a different account created with `PutDestination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDestination.html>`_ , for cross-account delivery. Kinesis Data Streams and Firehose are supported as logical destinations.

    Each account can have one account-level subscription filter policy. If you are updating an existing filter, you must specify the correct name in ``PolicyName`` . To perform a ``PutAccountPolicy`` subscription filter operation for any destination except a Lambda function, you must also have the ``iam:PassRole`` permission.

    *Field index policy*

    You can use field index policies to create indexes on fields found in log events in the log group. Creating field indexes lowers the scan volume for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that reference those fields, because these queries attempt to skip the processing of log events that are known to not match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query for. Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, user IDs, or instance IDs. For more information, see `Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogs-Field-Indexing.html>`_

    For example, suppose you have created a field index for ``requestId`` . Then, any CloudWatch Logs Insights query on that log group that includes ``requestId = *value*`` or ``requestId IN [ *value* , *value* , ...]`` will attempt to process only the log events where the indexed field matches the specified value.

    Matches of log events to the names of indexed fields are case-sensitive. For example, an indexed field of ``RequestId`` won't match a log event containing ``requestId`` .

    You can have one account-level field index policy that applies to all log groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level field index policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups with the ``SelectionCriteria`` parameter. If you have multiple account-level index policies with selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or overlapping log group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log groups that start with ``my-log`` , you can't have another field index policy filtered to ``my-logpprod`` or ``my-logging`` .

    *Transformer policy*

    A *log transformer policy* transforms ingested log events into a different format, making them easier for you to process and analyze. You can also transform logs from different sources into standardized formats that contain relevant, source-specific information. After you have created a transformer, CloudWatch Logs performs this transformation at the time of log ingestion. You can then refer to the transformed versions of the logs during operations such as querying with CloudWatch Logs Insights or creating metric filters or subscription filters.

    You can also use a transformer to copy metadata from metadata keys into the log events themselves. This metadata can include log group name, log stream name, account ID and Region.

    A transformer for a log group is a series of processors, where each processor applies one type of transformation to the log events ingested into this log group. For more information about the available processors to use in a transformer, see `Processors that you can use <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation.html#CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation-Processors>`_ .

    Having log events in standardized format enables visibility across your applications for your log analysis, reporting, and alarming needs. CloudWatch Logs provides transformation for common log types with out-of-the-box transformation templates for major AWS log sources such as VPC flow logs, Lambda , and Amazon RDS . You can use pre-built transformation templates or create custom transformation policies.

    You can create transformers only for the log groups in the Standard log class.

    You can have one account-level transformer policy that applies to all log groups in the account. Or you can create as many as 20 account-level transformer policies that are each scoped to a subset of log groups with the ``selectionCriteria`` parameter. If you have multiple account-level transformer policies with selection criteria, no two of them can use the same or overlapping log group name prefixes. For example, if you have one policy filtered to log groups that start with ``my-log`` , you can't have another field index policy filtered to ``my-logpprod`` or ``my-logging`` .

    You can also set up a transformer at the log-group level. For more information, see `AWS::Logs::Transformer <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-logs-transformer.html>`_ . If there is both a log-group level transformer created with ``PutTransformer`` and an account-level transformer that could apply to the same log group, the log group uses only the log-group level transformer. It ignores the account-level transformer.

    '''This structure contains information about one *delivery destination* in your account.

    A delivery destination is an AWS resource that represents an AWS service that logs can be sent to. CloudWatch Logs, Amazon S3, Firehose, and X-Ray are supported as delivery destinations.

    To configure logs delivery between a supported AWS service and a destination, you must do the following:

    - Create a delivery source, which is a logical object that represents the resource that is actually sending the logs. For more information, see `PutDeliverySource <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliverySource.html>`_ .
    - Create a *delivery destination* , which is a logical object that represents the actual delivery destination.
    - If you are delivering logs cross-account, you must use `PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy.html>`_ in the destination account to assign an IAM policy to the destination. This policy allows delivery to that destination.
    - Create a *delivery* by pairing exactly one delivery source and one delivery destination. For more information, see `CreateDelivery <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDelivery.html>`_ .

    You can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create multiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to the same delivery destination.

    '''Creates or updates one *delivery source* in your account.

    A delivery source is an AWS resource that sends logs to an AWS destination. The destination can be CloudWatch Logs , Amazon S3 , or Firehose .

    Only some AWS services support being configured as a delivery source. These services are listed as *Supported [V2 Permissions]* in the table at `Enabling logging from AWS services. <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/AWS-logs-and-resource-policy.html>`_

    To configure logs delivery between a supported AWS service and a destination, you must do the following:

    - Create a delivery source, which is a logical object that represents the resource that is actually sending the logs.
    - Create a *delivery destination* , which is a logical object that represents the actual delivery destination. For more information, see `AWS::Logs::DeliveryDestination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-logs-deliverydestination.html>`_ or `PutDeliveryDestination <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutDeliveryDestination.html>`_ .
    - Create a *delivery* by pairing exactly one delivery source and one delivery destination. For more information, see `AWS::Logs::Delivery <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-logs-delivery.html>`_ or `CreateDelivery <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDelivery.html>`_ .

    You can configure a single delivery source to send logs to multiple destinations by creating multiple deliveries. You can also create multiple deliveries to configure multiple delivery sources to send logs to the same delivery destination.

    '''Creates or updates an *anomaly detector* that regularly scans one or more log groups and look for patterns and anomalies in the logs.

    An anomaly detector can help surface issues by automatically discovering anomalies in your log event traffic. An anomaly detector uses machine learning algorithms to scan log events and find *patterns* . A pattern is a shared text structure that recurs among your log fields. Patterns provide a useful tool for analyzing large sets of logs because a large number of log events can often be compressed into a few patterns.

    The anomaly detector uses pattern recognition to find ``anomalies`` , which are unusual log events. It compares current log events and patterns with trained baselines.

    Fields within a pattern are called *tokens* . Fields that vary within a pattern, such as a request ID or timestamp, are referred to as *dynamic tokens* and represented by ``<*>`` .

        :param data_protection_policy: Creates a data protection policy and assigns it to the log group. A data protection policy can help safeguard sensitive data that's ingested by the log group by auditing and masking the sensitive log data. When a user who does not have permission to view masked data views a log event that includes masked data, the sensitive data is replaced by asterisks.
        :param deletion_protection_enabled: Indicates whether deletion protection is enabled for this log group. When enabled, deletion protection blocks all deletion operations until it is explicitly disabled. Default: - false
        :param field_index_policies: Creates or updates a *field index policy* for the specified log group. Only log groups in the Standard log class support field index policies. For more information about log classes, see `Log classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch_Logs_Log_Classes.html>`_ . You can use field index policies to create *field indexes* on fields found in log events in the log group. Creating field indexes lowers the costs for CloudWatch Logs Insights queries that reference those field indexes, because these queries attempt to skip the processing of log events that are known to not match the indexed field. Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query for and fields that have high cardinality of values Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, userID, and instance IDs. For more information, see `Create field indexes to improve query performance and reduce costs <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatchLogs-Field-Indexing.html>`_ . Currently, this array supports only one field index policy object.
        :param kms_key_id: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS key to use when encrypting log data. To associate an AWS key with the log group, specify the ARN of that KMS key here. If you do so, ingested data is encrypted using this key. This association is stored as long as the data encrypted with the KMS key is still within CloudWatch Logs . This enables CloudWatch Logs to decrypt this data whenever it is requested. If you attempt to associate a KMS key with the log group but the KMS key doesn't exist or is deactivated, you will receive an ``InvalidParameterException`` error. Log group data is always encrypted in CloudWatch Logs . If you omit this key, the encryption does not use AWS . For more information, see `Encrypt log data in CloudWatch Logs using AWS Key Management Service <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/encrypt-log-data-kms.html>`_
        :param log_group_class: Specifies the log group class for this log group. There are two classes:. - The ``Standard`` log class supports all CloudWatch Logs features. - The ``Infrequent Access`` log class supports a subset of CloudWatch Logs features and incurs lower costs. For details about the features supported by each class, see `Log classes <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch_Logs_Log_Classes.html>`_ Default: - "STANDARD"
        :param log_group_name: The name of the log group. If you don't specify a name, AWS CloudFormation generates a unique ID for the log group.
        :param resource_policy_document: Creates or updates a resource policy for the specified log group that allows other services to put log events to this account. A LogGroup can have 1 resource policy.
        :param retention_in_days: The number of days to retain the log events in the specified log group. Possible values are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 365, 400, 545, 731, 1096, 1827, 2192, 2557, 2922, 3288, and 3653. To set a log group so that its log events do not expire, do not specify this property.
        :param tags: An array of key-value pairs to apply to the log group. For more information, see `Tag <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-resource-tags.html>`_ .

Good fields to index are fields that you often need to query for and fields that have high cardinality of values Common examples of indexes include request ID, session ID, userID, and instance IDs.

            For more information about publishing dimensions with metrics created by metric filters, see `Publishing dimensions with metrics from values in JSON or space-delimited log events <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html#logs-metric-filters-dimensions>`_ .

               Metrics extracted from log events are charged as custom metrics. To prevent unexpected high charges, do not specify high-cardinality fields such as ``IPAddress`` or ``requestID`` as dimensions. Each different value found for a dimension is treated as a separate metric and accrues charges as a separate custom metric.

               To help prevent accidental high charges, Amazon disables a metric filter if it generates 1000 different name/value pairs for the dimensions that you have specified within a certain amount of time.

               You can also set up a billing alarm to alert you if your charges are higher than expected.

    '''The ``AWS::Logs::SubscriptionFilter`` resource specifies a subscription filter and associates it with the specified log group.

    Subscription filters allow you to subscribe to a real-time stream of log events and have them delivered to a specific destination. Currently, the supported destinations are:

    - An Amazon Kinesis data stream belonging to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
    - A logical destination that belongs to a different account, for cross-account delivery.
    - An Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.
    - An AWS Lambda function that belongs to the same account as the subscription filter, for same-account delivery.

    There can be as many as two subscription filters associated with a log group.

    '''Creates or updates a *log transformer* for a single log group.

    You use log transformers to transform log events into a different format, making them easier for you to process and analyze. You can also transform logs from different sources into standardized formats that contains relevant, source-specific information.

    After you have created a transformer, CloudWatch Logs performs the transformations at the time of log ingestion. You can then refer to the transformed versions of the logs during operations such as querying with CloudWatch Logs Insights or creating metric filters or subscription filers.

    You can also use a transformer to copy metadata from metadata keys into the log events themselves. This metadata can include log group name, log stream name, account ID and Region.

    A transformer for a log group is a series of processors, where each processor applies one type of transformation to the log events ingested into this log group. The processors work one after another, in the order that you list them, like a pipeline. For more information about the available processors to use in a transformer, see `Processors that you can use <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation-Processors.html#CloudWatch-Logs-Transformation-Processors>`_ .

    Having log events in standardized format enables visibility across your applications for your log analysis, reporting, and alarming needs. CloudWatch Logs provides transformation for common log types with out-of-the-box transformation templates for major AWS log sources such as VPC flow logs, Lambda, and Amazon RDS. You can use pre-built transformation templates or create custom transformation policies.

    You can create transformers only for the log groups in the Standard log class.

    You can also set up a transformer at the account level. For more information, see `PutAccountPolicy <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutAccountPolicy.html>`_ . If there is both a log-group level transformer created with ``PutTransformer`` and an account-level transformer that could apply to the same log group, the log group uses only the log-group level transformer. It ignores the account-level transformer.
