    This is the object used to access Data Cloud DLOs and DMOs. Accessing DLOs/DMOs
    are tracked and will throw an exception if they are mixed. In other words, you
    can read from DLOs and write to DLOs, read from DMOs and write to DMOs, but you
    cannot read from DLOs and write to DMOs or read from DMOs and write to DLOs.
    Furthermore you cannot mix during merging tables. This class is a singleton to
    prevent accidental mixing of DLOs and DMOs.

    You can provide custom readers and writers to the client for advanced use
    cases, but this is not recommended for testing as they may result in unexpected
    behavior once deployed to Data Cloud. By default, the client intercepts all
    read/write operations and mocks access to Data Cloud. For example, during
    writing, we print to the console instead of writing to Data Cloud.

        finder: Find a file path
        reader: A custom reader to use for reading Data Cloud objects.
        writer: A custom writer to use for writing Data Cloud objects.

    >>> client = Client()
    >>> file_path = client.find_file_path("data.csv")
    >>> dlo = client.read_dlo("my_dlo")
    >>> client.write_to_dmo("my_dmo", dlo)
