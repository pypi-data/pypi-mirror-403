Graph algorithms for dependency graph analysis.

This module provides algorithms for simplifying and analyzing
AWS resource dependency graphs, including:

- Transitive Reduction: Remove redundant edges for cleaner visualization
- Graph Statistics: Analyze graph properties and complexity

Transitive Reduction:
    Given a directed graph G, the transitive reduction G' is the minimal
    graph with the same reachability. If A → B → C exists, and also A → C,
    the edge A → C is redundant and can be removed.

    This is particularly useful for:
    - Cleaner Terraform dependency visualization
    - Reducing visual clutter in large graphs
    - Identifying true "direct" dependencies

Usage:
    from replimap.core.graph.algorithms import TransitiveReducer

    reducer = TransitiveReducer(graph_engine)
    result = reducer.reduce()
    print(f"Removed {result.edges_removed} redundant edges")

    Transitive reduction removes "shortcut" edges that are implied
