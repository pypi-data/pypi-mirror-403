"""Base protocol for experience streams.

Experience streams generate temporally-uniform experience for continual learning.
Every time step produces a new observation-target pair.

This module defines the ScanStream protocol for JAX scan-compatible streams.
All streams implement pure functions that can be JIT-compiled.

    """Protocol for JAX scan-compatible experience streams.

    Streams generate temporally-uniform experience for continual learning.
    Unlike iterator-based streams, ScanStream uses pure functions that
    can be compiled with JAX's JIT and used with jax.lax.scan.

    The stream should be non-stationary to test continual learning
    capabilities - the underlying target function changes over time.

    Type Parameters:
        StateT: The state type maintained by this stream

    Example:
        >>> stream = RandomWalkStream(feature_dim=10, drift_rate=0.001)
