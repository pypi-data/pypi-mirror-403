A JAX-based research framework implementing components of [The Alberta Plan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11173) in the pursuit of building the foundations of Continual AI.

> "The agents are complex only because they interact with a complex world... their initial design is as simple, general, and scalable as possible." — *Sutton et al., 2022*

## Overview

The Alberta Framework provides foundational components for continual reinforcement learning research. Built on JAX for hardware acceleration, the framework emphasizes temporal uniformity every component updates at every time step, with no special training phases or batch processing.

### Roadmap

Depending on my research trajectory I may or may not implement components required for the plan. The current focus of this framework is the Step 1 Baseline Study, investigating the interaction between adaptive optimizers and online normalization.

| Step | Focus | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Meta-learned step-sizes (IDBD, Autostep) | **Complete** |
| 2 | Feature generation and testing | Planned |
| 3 | GVF predictions, Horde architecture | Planned |
| 4 | Actor-critic with eligibility traces | Planned |
| 5-6 | Off-policy learning, average reward | Planned |
| 7-12 | Hierarchical, multi-agent, world models | Future |

## Installation

```bash
pip install alberta-framework

# With optional dependencies
pip install alberta-framework[gymnasium]  # RL environment support
pip install alberta-framework[dev]        # Development (pytest, ruff)
```

**Requirements:** Python >= 3.13, JAX >= 0.4, NumPy >= 2.0

## Quick Start

```python
import jax.random as jr
from alberta_framework import LinearLearner, IDBD, RandomWalkStream, run_learning_loop

# Non-stationary stream where target weights drift over time
stream = RandomWalkStream(feature_dim=10, drift_rate=0.001)

# Learner with IDBD meta-learned step-sizes
learner = LinearLearner(optimizer=IDBD())

# JIT-compiled training via jax.lax.scan
state, metrics = run_learning_loop(learner, stream, num_steps=10000, key=jr.key(42))
```

## Core Components

### Optimizers

- **LMS**: Fixed step-size baseline
- **IDBD**: Per-weight adaptive step-sizes via gradient correlation (Sutton, 1992)
- **Autostep**: Tuning-free adaptation with gradient normalization (Mahmood et al., 2012)

### Streams

Non-stationary experience generators implementing the `ScanStream` protocol:

- `RandomWalkStream`: Gradual target drift
- `AbruptChangeStream`: Sudden target switches
- `PeriodicChangeStream`: Sinusoidal oscillation
- `DynamicScaleShiftStream`: Time-varying feature scales

### Gymnasium Integration

```python
from alberta_framework.streams.gymnasium import collect_trajectory, learn_from_trajectory, PredictionMode
import gymnasium as gym

env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
observations, targets = collect_trajectory(env, policy, num_steps=10000, mode=PredictionMode.REWARD)
state, metrics = learn_from_trajectory(learner, observations, targets)
```

### Publication Tools

Multi-seed experiments with statistical analysis and publication-ready outputs:

```python
from alberta_framework.utils import ExperimentConfig, run_multi_seed_experiment, pairwise_comparisons

results = run_multi_seed_experiment(configs, seeds=30, parallel=True)
significance = pairwise_comparisons(results, test="ttest", correction="bonferroni")
```
