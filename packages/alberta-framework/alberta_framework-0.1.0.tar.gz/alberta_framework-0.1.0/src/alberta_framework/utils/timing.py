"""Timing utilities for measuring and reporting experiment durations.

This module provides a simple Timer context manager for measuring execution time
and formatting durations in a human-readable format.

Example:
    >>> from alberta_framework.utils.timing import Timer
    >>>
    >>> with Timer("Training"):
    ...     # run training code
    ...     pass
    Training completed in 1.23s
    >>>
    >>> # Or capture the duration:
    >>> with Timer("Experiment") as t:
    ...     # run experiment
    ...     pass
    >>> print(f"Took {t.duration:.2f} seconds")
"""
