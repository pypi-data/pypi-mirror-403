The pyroSAR package aims at providing a complete solution for the scalable organization and processing of SAR satellite data:
* Reading of data from various past and present satellite missions
* Handling of acquisition metadata
* User-friendly access to processing utilities in [SNAP](https://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/) 
and [GAMMA Remote Sensing](https://www.gamma-rs.ch/) software
* Formatting of the preprocessed data for further analysis
* Export to Data Cube solutions

Head on over to [readthedocs](https://pyrosar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) for installation instructions,
examples and API reference.
