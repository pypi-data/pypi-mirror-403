# Lotion

Lotion is a wrapper for `notion-client` by [ramnes/notion-sdk-py: The official Notion API client library, but rewritten in Python! (sync + async)](https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py).

With Lotion, you can easily use the Notion API.

```python
from lotion import Lotion

lotion = Lotion.get_instance("NOTION_API_SECRET")
# or `lotion = Lotion.get_instance()` if you set it as `NOTION_SECRET`

pages = lotion.retrieve_database("1696567a3bbf803e9817c7ae1e398b71")
for page in pages:
    print(page.get_title().text)
```

## Install

```shell
pip install python-lotion
```

You must also create your integration, obtain a Notion API secret, and give your integration page permissions.
