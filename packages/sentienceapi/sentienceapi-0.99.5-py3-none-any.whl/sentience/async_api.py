Async API for Sentience SDK - Convenience re-exports

This module re-exports all async functions for backward compatibility and developer convenience.
You can also import directly from their respective modules:

    # Option 1: From async_api (recommended for convenience)
    from sentience.async_api import (
        AsyncSentienceBrowser,
        snapshot_async,
        click_async,
        wait_for_async,
        screenshot_async,
        find_text_rect_async,
        # ... all async functions in one place
    )

    # Option 2: From respective modules (also works)
    from sentience.browser import AsyncSentienceBrowser
    from sentience.snapshot import snapshot_async
    from sentience.actions import click_async
"""

# ========== Actions (Phase 1) ==========
# Re-export async action functions from actions.py
from sentience.actions import (
    click_async,
    click_rect_async,
    press_async,
    scroll_to_async,
    type_text_async,
)

# ========== Phase 2C: Agent Layer ==========
# Re-export async agent classes from agent.py and base_agent.py
from sentience.agent import SentienceAgentAsync
from sentience.base_agent import BaseAgentAsync

# ========== Browser ==========
# Re-export AsyncSentienceBrowser from browser.py (moved there for better organization)
from sentience.browser import AsyncSentienceBrowser

# Re-export async expect functions from expect.py
from sentience.expect import ExpectationAsync, expect_async
from sentience.inspector import InspectorAsync, inspect_async

# Re-export async overlay functions from overlay.py
from sentience.overlay import clear_overlay_async, show_overlay_async

# ========== Query Functions (Pure Functions - No Async Needed) ==========
# Re-export query functions (pure functions, no async needed)
from sentience.query import find, query

# ========== Phase 2B: Supporting Utilities ==========
# Re-export async read functions from read.py
from sentience.read import read_async, read_best_effort_async

# ========== Phase 2D: Developer Tools ==========
# Re-export async recorder and inspector from their modules
from sentience.recorder import RecorderAsync, record_async

# Re-export async screenshot function from screenshot.py
from sentience.screenshot import screenshot_async

# ========== Snapshot (Phase 1) ==========
# Re-export async snapshot functions from snapshot.py
from sentience.snapshot import snapshot_async

# Re-export async text search function from text_search.py
from sentience.text_search import find_text_rect_async

# ========== Phase 2A: Core Utilities ==========
# Re-export async wait function from wait.py
from sentience.wait import wait_for_async
