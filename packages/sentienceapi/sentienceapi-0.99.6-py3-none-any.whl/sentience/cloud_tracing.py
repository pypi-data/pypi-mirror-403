    Enterprise Cloud Sink: "Local Write, Batch Upload" pattern.

    Architecture:
    1. **Local Buffer**: Writes to persistent cache directory (zero latency, non-blocking)
    2. **Pre-signed URL**: Uses secure pre-signed PUT URL from backend API
    3. **Batch Upload**: Uploads complete file on close() or at intervals
    4. **Zero Credential Exposure**: Never embeds DigitalOcean credentials in SDK
    5. **Crash Recovery**: Traces survive process crashes (stored in ~/.sentience/traces/pending/)

    This design ensures:
    - Fast agent performance (microseconds per emit, not milliseconds)
    - Security (credentials stay on backend)
    - Reliability (network issues don't crash the agent)
    - Data durability (traces survive crashes and can be recovered)

    Tiered Access:
    - Free Tier: Falls back to JsonlTraceSink (local-only)
    - Pro/Enterprise: Uploads to cloud via pre-signed URLs

    Example:
        >>> from sentience.cloud_tracing import CloudTraceSink
        >>> from sentience.tracing import Tracer
        >>> # Get upload URL from API
        >>> upload_url = "https://sentience.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/..."
        >>> sink = CloudTraceSink(upload_url, run_id="demo")
        >>> tracer = Tracer(run_id="demo", sink=sink)
        >>> tracer.emit_run_start("SentienceAgent")
        >>> tracer.close()  # Uploads to cloud
        >>> # Or non-blocking:
        >>> tracer.close(blocking=False)  # Returns immediately
