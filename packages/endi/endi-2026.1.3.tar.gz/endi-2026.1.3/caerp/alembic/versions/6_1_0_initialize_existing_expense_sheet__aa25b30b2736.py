    For all the pre-existing ExpenseSheet, there was no official_number, but
    the id was used as such.

    Initialy, expensesheet_number_template is initialized to `{SEQGLOBAL}` (see
    migration 9d9ab48e488c).

    So, we initialize existing official_number with the ExpenseSheet.id. And
    fill the sequence_number table accordingly. Note that this will create
    holes in sequences for existing ids.

    This migrations considers that no ExpenseSheet have been numbered with the
    new mechanism yet.
