    Define the workspace, a set of directories.

    LiveImport tracks modules that are either imported by a registered import
    statement, or are imported by a tracked module and have a source file in
    the workspace.  A source file is in the workspace if it's under a workspace
    directory.

    The default workspace is the current working directory when the LiveImport
    module is imported.  Thus, when LiveImport is used in a notebook, the
    workspace is the directory containing the notebook.

    :param directories: Zero or more path strings.  Each path must identify an
        existing directory.

    :raises ValueError: One of the specified paths does not exist or
        exists but is not a directory.

    Example: After calling

      .. code:: python

        liveimport.workspace("src", "/opt/notebook-utils")

    the workspace is the directory ``src`` in the current working directory and
    the directory ``/opt/notebook-utils``.

    If you call

      .. code:: python

        liveimport.workspace()  # No paths given

    the workspace is empty, so only modules referenced by registered imports
    will be tracked.

    .. note::
        Changing the workspace does not alter tracking decisions LiveImport has
        already made.  It only affects future decisions.  If you want a
        non-default workspace, its best to change it before registering any
        imports.
