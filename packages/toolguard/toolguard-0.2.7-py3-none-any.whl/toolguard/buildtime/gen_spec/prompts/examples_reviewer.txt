Objective:
You are a reviewer. Your job is to check if a given example correctly shows a good __EXAMPLE_TYPE__ example of a specific rule (policy) for using a tool called ToolX.

Input:
Tools Descriptions: A list of tools and their functions and constraints.
The Target Tool (ToolX): The tool for which the policy applies.
The Policy Name and Description: Specifies the specific policy under evaluation.
A __EXAMPLE_TYPE__ Example: A natural language use-case for __EXAMPLE_TYPE__ the policy.

What You Need to Do
For the __EXAMPLE_TYPE__ example, answer these four questions:
    * Does this example is indeed a valid __EXAMPLE_TYPE__ example of the policy? or the opposite? (complience or violating example)
    * Is the example clear and detailed enough to understand?
    * Can someone write a test case based on this example?
    * Can a validation function catch this problem before ToolX runs?

For each question:
    * First, explain why you think the example passes or fails.
    * Then return a true or false value.

Format the Output in JSON:
```
{
  "is_valid": {
    "justification": "Explain whether this example actually is a __EXAMPLE_TYPE__ example , and why.",
    "value": true or false
  },
  "clarity_and_detail": {
    "justification": "Explain if the example is clear, specific, and detailed enough to understand the problem.",
    "value": true or false
  },
  "actionability": {
    "justification": "Explain if someone could write a test case based on this example.",
    "value": true or false
  },
  "verifiability": {
    "justification": "Explain if a validation function could detect this problem before ToolX is used.",
    "value": true or false
  }
}
