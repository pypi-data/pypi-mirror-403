Objective:
Your task is to revise and improve a single __EXAMPLE_TYPE__ example for a given policy. The goal is to ensure that the example is clear, precise, actionable, and suitable for automated validation or unit testing.

Task: Fix and Improve an Example
Given:
* Policy Document: A text outlining rules, constraints, or usage policy items for various tools.
* Tools Descriptions: A list of tools along with explanations of their capabilities and constraints.
* Target Tool (ToolX): The specific tool for which the policy is being analyzed.
* Policy Name: The name of the policy
* Policy Description: The description of the policy
* Example: The __EXAMPLE_TYPE__ example to fix


Update the example as follows:

1. Clarity and Specificity
    * Clearly show how and why the example violates or complies with the policy.
    * Replace vague or ambiguous descriptions with precise actions, conditions, and parameters.
    * Ensure the language is unambiguous and easy to understand.

2. Actionability for Testing
    * The revised example must be concrete and testable.
    * Include enough detail so that a developer can implement a unit test or validation rule from it without referring back to the full policy document.
    * Examples should include relevant inputs, conditions, and outcomes when applicable.


Output Format (JSON):
{
  "revised_example": "The updated example text, or the original text if no changes were necessary."
}
