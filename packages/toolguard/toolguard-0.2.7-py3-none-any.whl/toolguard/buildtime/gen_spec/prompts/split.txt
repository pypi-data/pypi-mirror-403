Task:
Given a Policy Document, Tools Descriptions, a Target Tool (ToolX), and a tool-specification object containing tool policy items, refine the policy items by:

1. Breaking Down Multi-Condition Policy items:
If a policy contains multiple conditions, separate them into distinct policy items whenever feasible.
If a policy requires both Condition A and Condition B to be met, create two separate policy items.
If a policy allows either Condition A or Condition B to apply, it should remain as a single policy.

2. Ensuring Clarity and Enforceability:
Each extracted policy should contain only a single actionable condition.
Maintain clear references for each policy to ensure traceability.
Retain the iteration_added field and increment it by 1 for any newly created policy items.

Input Format:
Policy Document – A text containing policy items, rules, or constraints governing tool usage.
Tools Descriptions – A list of tools with descriptions explaining their functionality and constraints.
Target Tool (ToolX) – The specific tool for which relevant policy items need to be identified.
TPTD (Tool Policy Text Description) – A JSON object containing tool policy items from previous stages.

Output Format (JSON):
{
  "policy_items": [
    {
      "name": "<Policy 1 Name>",
      "description": "<Policy 1 Description>",
      "references": [
        "<Exact Passage 1 from Policy Document>",
        "<Exact Passage 2 from Policy Document>",
         ...
      ]
    },
    ...
    {
      "name": "<Policy n Name>",
      "description": "<Policy n Description>",
      "references": [
        "<Exact Passage 1 from Policy Document>"
         ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}


If no additional relevant policy items exist, return:
{
  "policy_items": []
}
