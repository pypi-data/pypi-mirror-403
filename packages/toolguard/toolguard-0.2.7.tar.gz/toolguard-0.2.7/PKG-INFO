              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# 📦 AI Agents Policy Adherence

This tool analyzes policy documents and generates deterministic Python code to enforce operational policies when invoking AI agent tools.
This work is described in [EMNLP 2025 Towards Enforcing Company Policy Adherence in Agentic Workflows](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16459).

Business policies (or guidelines) are normally detailed in company documents, and have traditionally been hard-coded into automatic assistant platforms. Contemporary agentic approaches take the "best-effort" strategy, where the policies are appended to the agent's system prompt, an inherently non-deterministic approach, that does not scale effectively. Here we propose a deterministic, predictable and interpretable two-phase solution for agentic policy adherence at the tool-level: guards are executed prior to function invocation and raise alerts in case a tool-related policy deem violated.

This component enforces **pre‑tool activation policy constraints**, ensuring that agent decisions comply with business rules **before** modifying system state. This prevents policy violations such as unauthorized tool calls or unsafe parameter values.


**Step 1**:

This component gets a set of tools and a policy document and generated multiple ToolGuard specifications, known as `ToolGuardSpec`s. Each specification is attached to a tool, and it declares a precondition that must apply before invoking the tool. The specification has a `name`, `description`, list of `refernces` to the original policy document, a set of declerative `compliance_examples`, describing test cases that the toolGuard should allow the tool invocation, and `violation_examples`, where the toolGuard should raise an exception.

The specifications are aimed to be used as input into our next component - described below.

The two components are not concatenated by design. As the geneartion involves a non-deterministic language model, the results need to be reviewed by a human. Hence, the output specification files should be reviewed and optionaly edited. For example, removing a wrong compliance example.

The OpenAPI document should describe agent tools and optionally include *read-only* tools that might be used to enforce policies. It’s important that each tool has:
- A proper `operation_id` matching the tool name
- A detailed description
- Clearly defined input parameters and return types
- Well-documented data models

**Step 2**:
Uses the output from Step 1 and the OpenAPI spec to generate Python code that enforces each tool’s policies.

---

## 🐍 Requirements

- Python 3.12+

---

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   uv pip install toolguard
   ```


## 📚 Usage Examples

### Quick Start

ToolGuard provides two main APIs:

1. **Buildtime API** (`toolguard.buildtime`): Generate guard specifications and code
2. **Runtime API** (`toolguard.runtime`): Execute guards during tool invocation

### Complete Example: Calculator with Policy Guards

This example demonstrates how to enforce policies on calculator tools.

#### Step 1: Define Your Tools

```python
# tools.py
def divide_tool(g: float, h: float) -> float:
    """Divides one number by another."""
    return g / h

def add_tool(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Adds two numbers."""
    return a + b

def multiply_tool(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    """Multiplies two numbers."""
    return a * b

def map_kdi_number(i: float) -> float:
    """Maps a number to its KDI value."""
    return 3.14 * i
```

#### Step 2: Define Your Policy Document

```markdown
# Calculator Usage Policy

## Operation Constraints

- **Division by Zero is Not Allowed**
  The calculator must not allow division by zero.

- **Summing Numbers Whose Product is 365 is Not Allowed**
  The calculator must not allow addition if their product equals 365.
  For example, adding 5 + 73 should be disallowed (5 * 73 = 365).

- **Multiplying Numbers When Any Operand's KDI Value Equals 6.28 is Not Allowed**
  If any operand has KDI(x) = 6.28, multiplication must be rejected.
```

#### Step 3: Generate Guard Specifications (Buildtime)

```python
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from toolguard.buildtime import generate_guard_specs, LitellmModel

async def generate_specs():
    # Configure LLM
    llm = LitellmModel(
        model_name="gpt-4o",
        provider="azure",
        kw_args={
            "api_base": "your-api-base",
            "api_version": "2024-08-01-preview",
            "api_key": "your-api-key", # pragma: allowlist secret
        }
    )

    # Load policy text
    with open("policy.md", "r") as f:
        policy_text = f.read()

    # Define tools
    tools = [divide_tool, add_tool, multiply_tool, map_kdi_number]

    # Generate specifications
    specs = await generate_guard_specs(
        policy_text=policy_text,
        tools=tools,
        work_dir="output/step1",
        llm=llm,
        short=True  # Use short mode for faster generation
    )

    return specs

# Run generation
specs = asyncio.run(generate_specs())
```

#### Step 4: Generate Guard Code (Buildtime)

```python
from toolguard.buildtime import generate_guards_code

async def generate_code():
    # Use specs from Step 3
    guards = await generate_guards_code(
        tool_specs=specs,
        tools=tools,
        work_dir="output/step2",
        llm=llm,
        app_name="calculator"
    )

    return guards

# Run code generation
guards = asyncio.run(generate_code())
```

#### Step 5: Use Guards at Runtime

```python
from toolguard.runtime import (
    load_toolguards,
    ToolFunctionsInvoker,
    PolicyViolationException
)

# Load generated guards
with load_toolguards("output/step2") as toolguard:
    # Create tool invoker
    invoker = ToolFunctionsInvoker([divide_tool, add_tool, multiply_tool])

    # Valid calls - these will succeed
    await toolguard.guard_toolcall("add_tool", {"a": 5, "b": 4}, invoker)
    await toolguard.guard_toolcall("divide_tool", {"g": 10, "h": 2}, invoker)

    # Policy violations - these will raise exceptions
    try:
        # Division by zero
        await toolguard.guard_toolcall("divide_tool", {"g": 5, "h": 0}, invoker)
    except PolicyViolationException as e:
        print(f"Policy violation: {e}")

    try:
        # Product equals 365
        await toolguard.guard_toolcall("add_tool", {"a": 5, "b": 73}, invoker)
    except PolicyViolationException as e:
        print(f"Policy violation: {e}")
```

### Working with Different Tool Types

#### Python Functions

```python
from toolguard.runtime import ToolFunctionsInvoker

tools = [divide_tool, add_tool, multiply_tool]
invoker = ToolFunctionsInvoker(tools)
```

#### Class Methods

```python
from toolguard.runtime import ToolMethodsInvoker
from toolguard.extra.api_to_functions import api_cls_to_functions

class CalculatorTools:
    def divide_tool(self, g: float, h: float) -> float:
        return g / h

    def add_tool(self, a: float, b: float) -> float:
        return a + b

# Convert class methods to functions for spec generation
tools = api_cls_to_functions(CalculatorTools)

# Use at runtime
invoker = ToolMethodsInvoker(CalculatorTools())
```

#### LangChain Tools

```python
from langchain.tools import tool
from toolguard.runtime import LangchainToolInvoker
from toolguard.extra.langchain_to_oas import langchain_tools_to_openapi

@tool
def divide_tool(g: float, h: float) -> float:
    """Divides one number by another."""
    return g / h

tools = [divide_tool, add_tool]

# Convert to OpenAPI for spec generation
oas = langchain_tools_to_openapi(tools)

# Use at runtime (note: args wrapped in "args" key)
invoker = LangchainToolInvoker(tools)
await toolguard.guard_toolcall("divide_tool", {"args": {"g": 5, "h": 2}}, invoker)
```

#### OpenAPI Specification

```python
from toolguard.buildtime.utils.open_api import OpenAPI

# Load OpenAPI spec
oas = OpenAPI.load_from("calculator_api.json")

# Generate guards using OpenAPI
guards = await generate_guards_code(
    tool_specs=specs,
    tools=oas.model_dump(),
    work_dir="output/step2",
    llm=llm,
    app_name="calculator"
)
```

### Advanced Configuration

#### Selective Tool Guard Generation

```python
# Generate specs only for specific tools
specs = await generate_guard_specs(
    policy_text=policy_text,
    tools=tools,
    work_dir="output/step1",
    llm=llm,
    tools2guard=["divide_tool", "add_tool"]  # Only these tools
)

# Generate code only for specific tools
guards = await generate_guards_code(
    tool_specs=specs,
    tools=tools,
    work_dir="output/step2",
    llm=llm,
    app_name="calculator",
    tool_names=["divide_tool"]  # Only this tool
)
```

#### Custom LLM Configuration

```python
from toolguard.buildtime import LitellmModel

# Azure OpenAI
llm = LitellmModel(
    model_name="gpt-4o-2024-08-06",
    provider="azure",
    kw_args={
        "api_base": "https://your-resource.openai.azure.com",
        "api_version": "2024-08-01-preview",
        "api_key": "your-key" # pragma: allowlist secret

### Loading Previously Generated Guards

```python
from toolguard.runtime import load_toolguards, ToolGuardsCodeGenerationResult

# Load from default location
with load_toolguards("output/step2") as toolguard:
    await toolguard.guard_toolcall("add_tool", {"a": 1, "b": 2}, invoker)

# Load from custom file
result = ToolGuardsCodeGenerationResult.load("output/step2", "custom_results.json")
```

### Error Handling

```python
from toolguard.runtime import PolicyViolationException

try:
    await toolguard.guard_toolcall("divide_tool", {"g": 5, "h": 0}, invoker)
except PolicyViolationException as e:
    # Handle policy violation
    print(f"Policy violated: {e}")
    # Log the violation, notify admin, etc.
except Exception as e:
    # Handle other errors
    print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Specification Generation**: Analyzes policy documents and tools to create `ToolGuardSpec` objects with compliance/violation examples
2. **Code Generation**: Converts specifications into executable Python guard functions with tests
3. **Runtime Enforcement**: Guards are executed before tool invocation, raising `PolicyViolationException` if policies are violated
