Task: Deduplicate Examples in Policy Evaluation Context

You are given the following inputs:
* Policy Document: A text outlining rules, constraints, or usage policy items for various tools.
* Tools Descriptions: A list of tools along with explanations of their capabilities and constraints.
* Target Tool (ToolX): The specific tool for which the policy is being analyzed.
* Policy Name: The name of the policy
* Policy Description: The description of the policy
* Violating Examples: A list of example scenarios that violate the policy.
* Compliance Examples: A list of example scenarios that are compliant with the policy.

Your task is to refine both sets of examples (violating and compliance) by merging identical or semantically duplicate examples:
Instructions:
1. Review the examples in each set independently (i.e., review violating examples separately from compliance examples).
2. Identify duplicates:
    * If two or more examples describe the same scenario (identical or paraphrased), merge them into one clear and representative example.
    * Examples are considered duplicates if they involve the same conditions and policy points being violated or followed.
3. Do not merge examples that:
    * Refer to different scenarios, distinct edge cases, or variations of policy application.
    * Provide unique value in understanding how the policy is applied or violated.

Example:
Input (Before Merging):
{
  "violation_examples": [
    "ToolX is used without an authentication token.",
    "A request is sent to ToolX without the required authentication token.",
    "Input exceeds the character limit for ToolX.",
    "ToolX request has input of more than 500 characters.",
    "A restricted keyword is used in ToolX query."
  ],
  "compliance_examples": [
    "A valid authentication token is used when calling ToolX.",
    "The input for ToolX is within the allowed character limit.",
    "No restricted keywords are present in the ToolX request.",
    "ToolX is accessed with proper credentials and policy-compliant query."
  ]
}

Output (After Merging):
{
  "violation_examples": [
    "A request is sent to ToolX without the required authentication token, violating the policy that mandates authentication.",
    "The input parameters for ToolX exceed the allowed 500-character limit, which violates input size constraints.",
    "A restricted keyword is used in the ToolX request, which the policy explicitly disallows."
  ],
  "compliance_examples": [
    "A user provides a valid authentication token when calling ToolX, following the authentication requirement.",
    "The input parameters for ToolX are within the allowed character limit, meeting the policy criteria.",
    "ToolX is accessed with valid credentials and a policy-compliant query containing no restricted keywords."
  ]
}
