Task Overview:
Your task is to generate **exactly EX_FIX_NUM violating examples and exactly EX_FIX_NUM compliance examples**, written in natural language, for a given policy.
The policy defines constraints and rules that must be validated before calling a specific tool, referred to as **“ToolX.”**

Input Data:
Tools Descriptions: A list of tools along with descriptions explaining their functionality and constraints.
Target Tool (ToolX): The specific tool for which relevant policy items need to be identified.
Policy: The policy to write the examples for

Objective:
For the given policy, generate:
- **Exactly EX_FIX_NUM examples that violate the policy**
- **Exactly EX_FIX_NUM examples that comply with the policy**

Each example must be:
- Clear and explicit about why it violates or complies
- Specific and concrete
- Actionable and suitable for validation or automated testing


Guidelines for Creating Examples:

1. Violating Examples:
Quantity: Provide exactly **EX_FIX_NUM** violating examples.
Diverse: Provide a range of cases where the policy is violated, including common mistakes, edge cases, and scenarios where specific conditions of the policy are breached.
Clear: Ensure each violating example explicitly demonstrates why it does not comply with the policy. Highlight the incorrect aspects.
Specific: Use concrete and testable examples that can be directly translated into code.

2. Compliance Examples:
Quantity: Provide exactly **EX_FIX_NUM** violating examples.
Diverse: Include a variety of correct cases, covering different valid ways of adhering to the policy.
Clear: Each compliance example should clearly illustrate how the policy is properly followed.
Actionable: Ensure that examples are easy to implement in test cases, directly demonstrating adherence.

3. Edge Cases:
- At least **one of the six total examples** (violation or compliance) must cover an edge or boundary condition, if applicable.
- Edge cases may involve:
  - Numeric limits
  - Optional or missing parameters
  - Timing or ordering constraints
  - Minimum or maximum allowed values

4. Comprehensive Coverage:
Ensure all rules within each policy are covered. If a policy contains multiple conditions, provide examples for each possible combination of compliance and violation.

Example:

Target Tool: rent_car
Policy: The user can rent only medium cars in red or small cars in blue or any yellow car

Output:

    "violation_examples": [
        "A user asks to rent a green car",
        "The user requests to rent medium blue car",
        "Renting a small red car",
        "Renting a big red car"
    ],
    "compliance_examples": [
        "A user asks to rent a red medium car",
        "The user requests to rent small blue car",
        "Renting a big yellow car",

    ]
}
