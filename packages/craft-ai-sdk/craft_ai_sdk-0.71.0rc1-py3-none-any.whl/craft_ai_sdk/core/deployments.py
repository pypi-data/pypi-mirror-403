    """Create a deployment associated with a given pipeline.

    Args:
        pipeline_name (:obj:`str`): Name of the pipeline to deploy.
        deployment_name (:obj:`str`): Name of the deployment.
        execution_rule(:obj:`str`): Execution rule of the deployment. Can
            be ``"endpoint"`` or ``"periodic"``. For convenience, members of the
            enumeration :class:`DEPLOYMENT_EXECUTION_RULES` can be used. If the
            execution rule is ``"periodic"``, ``schedule`` must be provided. If it is
            ``"endpoint"``, see the note below on how to trigger the endpoint.
        mode (:obj:`str`): Mode of the deployment. Can be ``"elastic"`` or
            ``"low_latency"``. Defaults to ``"elastic"``. For convenience, members of
            the enumeration :class:`DEPLOYMENT_MODES` can be used. This defines how
            computing resources are allocated for pipeline executions:

                * ``"elastic"``: Each pipeline execution runs in a new isolated
                  container ("pod"), with its own memory (RAM, VRAM, disk). No
                  variables or files are shared between executions, and the pod is
                  destroyed when the execution ends. This mode is simple to use because
                  it automatically uses computing resources for running executions, and
                  each execution starts from an identical blank state. But it takes time
                  to create a new pod at the beginning of each execution (tens of
                  seconds), and computing resources can become saturated when there are
                  more executions.
                * ``"low_latency"``: All pipeline executions for the same deployment run
                  in a shared container ("pod") with shared memory. The pod is created
                  when the deployment is created, and deleted when the deployment is
                  deleted. Shared memory means that if one execution modifies a global
                  variable or a file, subsequent executions on the same pod will see the
                  modified value. This mode makes it possible for executions to respond
                  quickly (less than 0.5 seconds of overhead) because the pod is already
                  up and running when an execution starts, and it is possible to preload
                  or cache data. But it requires care in the code because of possible
                  interactions between executions. And it requires care in how computing
                  resources are used, because pods use resources continuously even when
                  there is no ongoing execution, and the number of pods does not
                  automatically adapt to the number of executions. During the lifetime
                  of a deployment, a pod may be re-created by the platform for
                  technical reasons (including if it tries to use more memory than
                  available). This mode is not compatible with pipelines created with a
                  ``container_config.dockerfile_path`` property in
                  :func:`create_pipeline`.

        schedule (:obj:`str`, optional): Schedule of the deployment. Required and
            applicable only if ``execution_rule`` is ``"periodic"``. Must be a valid
            `cron expression <https://www.npmjs.com/package/croner>`.
            The deployment will be executed periodically according to this schedule.
            The schedule must follow this format:
            ``<minute> <hour> <day of month> <month> <day of week>``.
            Note that the schedule is in UTC time zone.
            '*' means all possible values.
            Here are some examples:

                * ``"0 0 * * *"`` will execute the deployment every day at
                  midnight.
                * ``"0 0 5 * *"`` will execute the deployment every 5th day of
                  the month at midnight.

        endpoint_url_path (:obj:`str`, optional): Applicable only if ``execution_rule``
          is ``"endpoint"``. The last part of the URL (address) used to trigger the
          endpoint deployment. See the note below on how to trigger the endpoint. By
          default the value of ``deployment_name`` is used. This can be used to
          customize the URL independently of ``deployment_name``.

        inputs_mapping(:obj:`list` of instances of :class:`InputSource`):
            List of input mappings, to map pipeline inputs to different
            sources (such as constant values, endpoint inputs, or environment
            variables). See :class:`InputSource` for more details.
            For endpoint rules, if an input of the pipeline is not explicitly mapped, it
            will be automatically mapped to an endpoint input with the same name.
            For periodic rules, all inputs of the pipeline must be explicitly mapped.
        outputs_mapping(:obj:`list` of instances of :class:`OutputDestination`):
            List of output mappings, to map pipeline outputs to different
            destinations. See :class:`OutputDestination` for more details.
            For endpoint rules, if an output of the pipeline is not explicitly mapped,
            it will be automatically mapped to an endpoint output with the same name.
            For periodic rules, all outputs of the pipeline must be explicitly mapped.
        description (:obj:`str`, optional): Description of the deployment.
        enable_parallel_executions (:obj:`bool`, optional):
            .. _enable_parallel_executions:

            Whether to run several executions
            at the same time in the same pod, if ``mode`` is
            ``"low_latency"``. Not applicable if ``mode`` is ``"elastic"``, where each
            execution always runs in a new pod. This is disabled by default, which means
            that for a deployment with ``"low_latency"`` ``mode``, by default only one
            execution runs at a time on a pod, and other executions are pending while
            waiting for the running one to finish. Enabling this may be useful for
            inference batching on a model that takes much memory, so the model is loaded
            in memory only once and can be used for several inferences at the same time.
            If this is enabled then global variables, GPU memory and disk files are
            shared between multiple executions, so you must be mindful of potential race
            conditions and concurrency issues. For each execution running on a pod, the
            main Python function is run either as an ``asyncio`` coroutine with
            ``await`` if the function was defined with ``async def`` (recommended), or
            in a new thread if the function was defined simply with ``def``. Environment
            variables are updated whenever a new execution starts on the pod. Using some
            libraries with async/threaded methods in your code may cause logs to be
            associated with the wrong running execution (logs are associated with
            executions through Python ``contextvars``).
        max_parallel_executions_per_pod (:obj:`int`, optional):
            .. _max_parallel_executions_per_pod:

            Only applicable if
            ``enable_parallel_executions`` is ``True``. The maximum number of executions
            that can run at the same time on a deployment's pod in ``"low_latency"``
            ``mode`` where ``enable_parallel_executions`` is ``True``: if a greater
            number of executions are requested at the same time, then only
            ``max_parallel_executions_per_pod`` executions will actually be running on
            the pod, and the other ones will be pending until a running execution
            finishes. Defaults to 6.
        ram_request (:obj:`str`, optional): The amount of memory (RAM) requested for
            the deployment in KiB, MiB and GiB. The value must be a string with a number
            followed by a unit, for example "512MiB" or "1GiB". This is only available
            for "low_latency" deployments mode.
        gpu_request (:obj:`int`, optional): The number of GPUs requested for the
            deployment. This is only available for "low_latency" deployments mode.
        wait_for_completion (:obj:`bool`, optional): Whether to wait for the deployment
            to be ready. Defaults to ``True``.
        timeout_s (:obj:`int`): The execution timeout parameter defines how long code
        can run before it is automatically stopped.
        Parallel mode:
          Async code: The timeout works correctly, if the execution exceeds the limit,
          the task is canceled.
          Non-async code: The timeout is applied, but the running thread is not
          forcibly stopped, which may delay termination.
        Queue mode:
          Async code: The execution is canceled on timeout.
          Non-async code: No timeout is applied (runs in the main thread).
        endpoint_token (:obj:`str`, optional): Applicable only if ``execution_rule``
          is ``"endpoint"``. The token to access the endpoint. If not set, a token
          will be generated. This token is different from the SDK token, you can find it
          in the result of this function as "endpoint_token". It is used as a secret
          to trigger the endpoint.

    Note:
      When ``execution_rule`` is ``"endpoint"``:

        * When the endpoint deployment is created, it creates an HTTP endpoint which can
          be called at ``POST {environment_url}/endpoints/{endpoint_url_path}``. You can
          get `environment_url` with `sdk.base_environment_url`. `endpoint_url_path` is
          the `endpoint_name` if `endpoint_url_path` is not provided.

      | An endpoint token is required to call the HTTP endpoint. This token is different
        from the SDK token, you can find it in the result of this function as
        "endpoint_token". Use it to set the ``"Authorization"`` header as
        ``"EndpointToken {endpoint_token}"``.
      | Input can be passed to the endpoint either:

        * When there is no input file mapped to the endpoint, in the body in JSON with
          the `application/json` content type and with the format

          .. code-block:: json

              {
                "{input_name}": "{input_value}"
              }

        * When a file input is mapped to the endpoint, as a file with a
          `multipart/form-data` content type.

      This will return the output as:

        * When there is no output file, in the body in JSON in the format

          .. code-block:: json

              {
                "output": {
                  "{output_name}": "{output_value}"
                }
              }

        * When a file output is mapped, it will return the file as a response with the
          `application/octet-stream` content type.

      | A successful call will return results with a status code 200 after redirections.
      | If your HTTP client does not follow redirection automatically, redirections are
        indicated by a status code between 300 and 399, and the redirection URL is in
        the `Location` header. Keep calling the redirection URL until you get a
        non-redirection status code.
      | If an endpoint deployment's execution encounters an error, it will return a
        status code between 400 and 599, and an error message in the body at the
        property `message`.
      | Here is an example of a successful call with curl:

      .. code-block:: bash

        curl -L "{environment_url}/endpoints/{endpoint_name}" \\
          -H "Authorization: EndpointToken {endpoint_token}" \\
          -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" \\
