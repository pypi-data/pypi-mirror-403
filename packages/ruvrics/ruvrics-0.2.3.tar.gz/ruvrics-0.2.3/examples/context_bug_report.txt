Bug Report #7823
Submitted by: Sarah M. (Enterprise Customer)
Priority: Not set
Product: Analytics Dashboard v4.2

Description:
The export function is behaving strangely. Sometimes when I export a report to PDF, the charts are missing. But other times it works fine. I can't figure out the pattern.

Steps I've tried:
- Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox) - same issue
- Different report types - happens on some, not others
- Different times of day - no pattern I can see

Additional context:
- This started happening after the update last week
- My colleague says they haven't seen this issue
- We're on the Enterprise plan
- This is blocking our monthly board report which is due Friday

I've attached 3 screenshots showing the missing charts. The same report exported fine yesterday but failed today.

Environment:
- Browser: Chrome 120.0.6099.130
- OS: macOS Sonoma 14.2
- Account type: Enterprise
- Report size: ~50 charts, 120 pages
