Customer Review #4892 - Premium Subscription Service

I've been using this service for about 6 months now. The core features work as advertised and the mobile app is decent. However, I've had some frustrating experiences with customer support - waited 3 days for a response to a billing issue. The price increase last month was also unexpected and not communicated well.

On the positive side, the new dashboard they released is actually quite good and saves me time. The integration with Slack finally works properly after the last update. My team uses it daily and it's become part of our workflow.

Would I recommend it? It depends on your needs. If you need something reliable for basic tasks and don't mind occasional hiccups with support, it's fine. But if you're looking for premium service to match the premium price, you might want to look elsewhere. I'm staying for now because switching costs are high, but I'm keeping an eye on alternatives.
