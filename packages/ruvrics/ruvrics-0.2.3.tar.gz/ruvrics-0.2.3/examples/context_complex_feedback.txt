============================================================

POSITIVE:
"Switched from Competitor X last quarter. Migration was smooth and your onboarding team was exceptional. Already seeing productivity gains." - Mid-market, Manufacturing

"Support resolved our critical issue in under 2 hours on a Saturday. That's rare." - Small business, Consulting

NEGATIVE:
"We're evaluating alternatives. Three outages in Q4 is unacceptable for an enterprise product at this price point." - Enterprise, Healthcare (1200 seats, $180k ARR)

"Raised a P1 ticket 5 days ago, still waiting for meaningful response. Our CEO is asking questions." - Enterprise, Tech (800 seats)

"The October price increase with no new features felt like a betrayal. We've been customers for 4 years." - Mid-market, Education

MIXED:
"Product is solid when it works. But 'when it works' is the key phrase lately." - Enterprise, Retail

"Love the core functionality, hate the mobile experience. It's like two different companies built them." - Mid-market, Media

"Your enterprise tier pricing makes sense for large teams but punishes growing companies. We're stuck in an awkward middle." - Mid-market, Startup (growing from 80 to 200 seats)
