(Enterprise Customer)\nPriority: Not set\nProduct: Analytics Dashboard v4.2\n\nDescription:\nThe export function is behaving strangely. Sometimes when I export a report to PDF, the charts are missing. But other times it works fine. I can't figure out the pattern.\n\nSteps I've tried:\n- Different browsers (Chrome, Firefox) - same issue\n- Different report types - happens on some, not others\n- Different times of day - no pattern I can see\n\nAdditional context:\n- This started happening after the update last week\n- My colleague says they haven't seen this issue\n- We're on the Enterprise plan\n- This is blocking our monthly board report which is due Friday\n\nI've attached 3 screenshots showing the missing charts. The same report exported fine yesterday but failed today.\n\nEnvironment:\n- Browser: Chrome 120.0.6099.130\n- OS: macOS Sonoma 14.2\n- Account type: Enterprise\n- Report size: ~50 charts, 120 pages",
