    We truncate the description automatically according to the limits of the used payment method. The description is
    also visible in any exports you generate.

    We recommend you use a unique identifier so that you can always link the payment to the order in your back office.
    This is particularly useful for bookkeeping.

    The maximum length of the description field differs per payment method, with the absolute maximum being 255
    characters. The API will not reject strings longer than the maximum length but it will truncate them to fit.

    r"""The URL your customer will be redirected to after the payment process.

    It could make sense for the redirectUrl to contain a unique identifier – like your order ID – so you can show the
    right page referencing the order when your customer returns.

    The parameter is normally required, but can be omitted for recurring payments (`sequenceType: recurring`) and for
    Apple Pay payments with an `applePayPaymentToken`.

    r"""The URL your customer will be redirected to when the customer explicitly cancels the payment. If this URL is not
    provided, the customer will be redirected to the `redirectUrl` instead — see above.

    Mollie will always give you status updates via webhooks, including for the canceled status. This parameter is
    therefore entirely optional, but can be useful when implementing a dedicated customer-facing flow to handle
    payment cancellations.

    webhook_url: NotRequired[Nullable[str]]
    r"""The webhook URL where we will send payment status updates to.

    The webhookUrl is optional, but without a webhook you will miss out on important status changes to your payment.

    The webhookUrl must be reachable from Mollie's point of view, so you cannot use `localhost`. If you want to use
    webhook during development on `localhost`, you must use a tool like ngrok to have the webhooks delivered to your
    local machine.

    method and your customer will skip the selection screen and is sent directly to the chosen payment method. The
    parameter enables you to fully integrate the payment method selection into your website.

    You can also specify the methods in an array. By doing so we will still show the payment method selection screen
    but will only show the methods specified in the array. For example, you can use this functionality to only show
    payment methods from a specific country to your customer `['bancontact', 'belfius']`.

    Use this parameter to restrict the payment methods available to your customer to those from a single country.

    If available, the credit card method will still be offered, but only cards from the allowed country are accepted.

    The field expects a country code in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format, for example `NL`.

    r"""Whether to create the entity in test mode or live mode.

    Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode, in which case this parameter can be

    Some payment methods are a network of connected banks or card issuers. In these cases, after selecting the payment

    We provide hosted issuer selection screens, but these screens can be skipped by providing the `issuer` via the API
    up front.

    The full list of issuers for a specific method can be retrieved via the Methods API by using the optional
