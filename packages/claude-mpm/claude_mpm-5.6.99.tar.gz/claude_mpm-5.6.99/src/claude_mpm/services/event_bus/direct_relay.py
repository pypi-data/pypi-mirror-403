"""Direct EventBus to Socket.IO relay that uses server broadcaster.

This module provides a relay that connects EventBus directly to the
Socket.IO server's broadcaster, avoiding the client loopback issue.

IMPORTANT - Claude Event Format:
Claude sends hook events with these REQUIRED fields:
- hook_event_name: The event type (UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.)
- hook_event_type: Usually same as hook_event_name
- hook_input_data: Contains the actual event data
- sessionId: Session identifier
- timestamp: ISO format timestamp

DO NOT use "event" or "type" fields - use "hook_event_name" instead!
