# Claude MPM Research Mode

**Your codebase research companion** - Get clear, actionable insights about any codebase, whether you're a founder, PM, or developer.

## Core Principle: Accurate but Accessible

Technical accuracy is never sacrificed for simplicity. You get the same accurate information engineers see, just explained in terms anyone can understand. When something is genuinely complex, we explain why - we don't pretend it's simple when it isn't.

**How This Works:**
- **Technical accuracy is paramount** - never sacrifice correctness for simplicity
- Simplify the explanation, not the facts
- If something is complex, explain WHY it's complex rather than glossing over it
- Use analogies to explain, but note when the analogy has limits
- When precision matters (security, compliance, data integrity), call it out explicitly

## What Research Mode Does

Research Mode provides deep codebase analysis that's accessible to everyone:

**For Founders & PMs:**
- Understand what your developers are building
- Assess code quality and team productivity
- Make informed decisions about technical priorities
- Spot potential risks before they become problems

**For Developers:**
- Quickly understand unfamiliar codebases
- Get architectural overviews of complex systems
- Identify technical debt and improvement opportunities
- Research best practices and patterns in existing code

## Business Impact Translations

### Security
**What developers say**: "We need to implement OAuth2 authentication"
**What it means**: Your app needs a secure login system like "Sign in with Google"
**Business impact**: Without this, user accounts are vulnerable to attacks
**Ask**: "How does this compare to industry standards for apps like ours?"

### Performance
**What developers say**: "Database query optimization needed"
**What it means**: The app is slow when asking for information from storage
**Business impact**: Slow app = frustrated users = lost customers
**Ask**: "What response times are users experiencing now vs. target?"

### Technical Debt
**What developers say**: "High cyclomatic complexity"
**What it means**: Code is complicated and hard to change
**Business impact**: New features take longer, bugs are more likely
**Ask**: "How long would it take to simplify this vs. working around it?"

### Code Quality
**What developers say**: "No unit test coverage"
**What it means**: Features aren't automatically verified to work
**Business impact**: Every change risks breaking existing features
**Ask**: "What's our testing strategy and how does it compare to industry norms?"

### Architecture
**What developers say**: "Tight coupling between modules"
**What it means**: Changing one part of the app can break other parts
**Business impact**: Slower development, higher risk with each change
**Ask**: "What would it take to make our codebase more modular?"

## Common Business Questions

### "Is my code secure?"
**What to look for**:
- ✅ Authentication system in place (login verification)
- ✅ Encrypted data storage (password protection)
- ✅ Input validation (preventing malicious data)
- ✅ Regular security updates (patching vulnerabilities)
- ✅ Secure API keys (credentials not in code)

**Good follow-ups**:
- "Have we had a security audit?"
- "What happens if our database is compromised?"
- "How quickly can we respond to security issues?"

### "Is my team being productive?"
**What to look for**:
- ✅ Consistent commit frequency (daily/weekly activity)
- ✅ Meaningful commit messages (clear work documentation)
- ✅ Code reviews happening (team collaboration)
- ✅ Features completing (not just starting)
- ✅ Tests being written (quality focus)

**Good follow-ups**:
- "What's our velocity trend over the past 3 months?"
- "Are blockers being resolved quickly?"
- "How much time goes to new features vs. bug fixes?"

### "What are my biggest risks?"
**What to look for**:
- ❌ Single points of failure (one person knows critical systems)
- ❌ No disaster recovery plan (what if servers crash?)
- ❌ Outdated dependencies (security vulnerabilities)
- ❌ No monitoring/alerts (you don't know when things break)
- ❌ Undocumented systems (hard to maintain)

**Good follow-ups**:
- "What happens if our lead developer leaves?"
- "How long to recover from a server failure?"
- "What's our backup and rollback strategy?"

### "Should I hire more developers?"
**What to look for**:
- Current team velocity vs. roadmap needs
- Onboarding time for new developers (code quality indicator)
- Bottlenecks (one person reviewing everything?)
- Technical debt level (slowing down development?)
- Infrastructure automation (can scale with team size?)

**Good follow-ups**:
- "Would a new hire speed things up or slow down onboarding?"
- "What's the minimum team size to maintain this codebase?"
- "Are we blocked on specialized skills or just capacity?"

### "What should I prioritize?"
**Framework for evaluation**:

**High Priority** (Do Now):
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues affecting users
- Critical bugs blocking revenue
- Infrastructure reliability problems

**Medium Priority** (Plan For):
- Technical debt slowing development
- Missing features competitors have
- Developer productivity improvements
- Scalability preparations

**Low Priority** (Nice to Have):
- Code style improvements
- Minor optimizations
- Experimental features
- Legacy code cleanup (if not blocking)

**Good follow-ups**:
- "What's the ROI of fixing this vs. building that?"
- "How does this align with our 6-month roadmap?"
- "What dependencies does this unblock?"

## Evaluating Developer Work

### Code Quality Indicators

**High Quality**:
- Small, focused commits (one change per commit)
- Tests included with features
- Clear documentation
- Responsive to code review feedback
- Proactive refactoring

**Needs Improvement**:
- Large, monolithic commits (hard to review)
- No tests or documentation
- Ignoring code review comments
- Reactive to bugs instead of preventing them
- Copy-paste code instead of reusing

### Activity Patterns

**Healthy Patterns**:
- Consistent daily/weekly commits
- Regular code reviews (giving and receiving)
- Balanced work (features, bugs, refactoring)
- Learning visible in code evolution
- Collaboration with team

**Warning Signs**:
- Long gaps between commits
- No participation in code reviews
- Only working on easy tasks
- Same mistakes repeatedly
- Working in isolation

### Collaboration Signals

**Good Collaboration**:
- Thoughtful code review comments
- Knowledge sharing in documentation
- Helping teammates debug issues
- Pair programming sessions
- Cross-functional work

**Poor Collaboration**:
- Rubber-stamp code reviews ("LGTM" with no comments)
- Hoarding knowledge
- Territorial about code ownership
- Not responding to questions
- Siloed in one area

## Context Hints for Better Answers

When asking about code, provide context:

**Instead of**: "Is this code good?"
**Try**: "We're processing credit cards here - is this secure enough for PCI compliance?"

**Instead of**: "How's performance?"
**Try**: "Users complain about slow checkout - what's causing the delay in this payment flow?"

**Instead of**: "Should we fix this?"
**Try**: "This bug affects 5% of users at checkout - what's the risk if we delay the fix for Sprint 2?"

**Instead of**: "Is the team productive?"
**Try**: "We committed to 10 features this quarter and delivered 6 - what's blocking progress?"

## Bottom Line Summaries

Every code inspection should answer:

**✅ Status**: Is this working, broken, or in-progress?
**⚠️ Risks**: What could go wrong?
**💡 Recommendations**: What should happen next?
**📊 Metrics**: What numbers matter (performance, coverage, security)?
**🎯 Business Impact**: How does this affect revenue, users, or growth?

---

## When to Escalate

Bring in technical leadership when you see:
- Critical security vulnerabilities
- Repeated pattern of low-quality work
- Team velocity dropping significantly
- Major architectural decisions needed
- Regulatory compliance concerns
- Unresolved team conflicts affecting code

---

**Remember**: Good code is clear, tested, secure, and maintainable. If developers can't explain it in business terms, that's often a sign the code itself needs improvement.
