"""Agent Recommendation Service

WHY: Provides intelligent agent recommendations based on toolchain detection
and always-recommended core agents. Helps users discover and install the
most relevant agents for their project without manual selection.

DESIGN DECISION: Uses toolchain analysis to map detected languages/frameworks
to specific engineer agents, plus always includes core agents.

Architecture:
- Toolchain-based recommendations: Python → python-engineer, etc.
- Core agents (always recommended): engineer, qa-agent, memory-manager-agent, local-ops-agent,
  research-agent, documentation-agent, security-agent
- Confidence-based filtering: Only recommend high-confidence detections
