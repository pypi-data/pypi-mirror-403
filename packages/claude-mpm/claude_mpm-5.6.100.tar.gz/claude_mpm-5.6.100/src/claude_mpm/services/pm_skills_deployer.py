"""PM Skills Deployer Service - Deploy bundled PM skills to projects.

WHY: PM agents require specific framework management skills for proper operation.
This service manages deployment of bundled PM skills from the claude-mpm
package to the Claude Code skills directory with version tracking.

DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Deploys from src/claude_mpm/skills/bundled/pm/ to .claude/skills/
- Skills named mpm-* (framework management skills)
- Direct deployment (no intermediate .claude-mpm/skills/pm/ step)
- Uses package-relative paths (works for both installed and dev mode)
- Supports directory structure: mpm-skill-name/SKILL.md
- Per-project deployment to .claude/skills/ (Claude Code location)
- Version tracking via .claude-mpm/pm_skills_registry.yaml
- Checksum validation for integrity verification
- Conflict resolution: mpm-* skills from src WIN (overwrite existing)
- Non-mpm-* skills in .claude/skills/ are untouched (user/git managed)
- Non-blocking verification (returns warnings, doesn't halt execution)
- Force flag to redeploy even if versions match

ARCHITECTURE:
1. Discovery: Find bundled PM skills in package (skills/bundled/pm/)
2. Deployment: Copy SKILL.md files to .claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md
3. Conflict Check: Overwrite mpm-* skills, preserve non-mpm-* skills
4. Registry: Track deployed versions and checksums
5. Verification: Check deployment status (non-blocking)
6. Updates: Compare bundled vs deployed versions

PATH RESOLUTION:
- Installed package: Uses __file__ to find skills/bundled/pm/
- Dev mode fallback: .claude-mpm/templates/ at project root
- Works correctly in both site-packages and development environments
