"""
Claude MPM Skills Package

Skills system for sharing common capabilities across agents.
This reduces redundancy by extracting shared patterns into reusable skills.

Skills can be:
- Bundled with MPM (in skills/bundled/)
- User-installed (in ~/.claude/skills/)
- Project-specific (in .claude/skills/)

New Skills Integration System:
- SkillsService: Core service for skill management
- AgentSkillsInjector: Dynamic skill injection into agent templates
- SkillsRegistry: Helper class for registry operations

Legacy System (maintained for compatibility):
- Skill: Dataclass for skill representation
- SkillManager: Legacy skill manager
- get_registry: Legacy registry access
