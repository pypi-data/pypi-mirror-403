"""Skills Deployer Service - Deploy Claude Code skills from GitHub.

WHY: Claude Code loads skills at STARTUP ONLY from ~/.claude/skills/ directory.
This service manages downloading skills from external GitHub repositories and
deploying them to Claude Code's skills directory with automatic restart warnings.

DESIGN DECISIONS:
- Downloads from https://github.com/bobmatnyc/claude-mpm-skills by default
- Deploys to ~/.claude/skills/ (Claude Code's directory), NOT project directory
- Integrates with ToolchainAnalyzer for automatic language detection
- Handles Claude Code restart requirement (skills only load at startup)
- Provides filtering by toolchain and categories
- Graceful error handling with actionable messages

ARCHITECTURE:
1. GitHub Download: Fetch ZIP archive from repository
2. Manifest Parsing: Read skill metadata from manifest.json
3. Filtering: Apply toolchain and category filters
4. Deployment: Copy skills to ~/.claude/skills/
5. Restart Detection: Warn if Claude Code is running
6. Cleanup: Remove temporary files
