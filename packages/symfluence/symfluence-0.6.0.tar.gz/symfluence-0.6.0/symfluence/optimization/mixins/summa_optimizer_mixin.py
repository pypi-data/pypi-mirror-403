SUMMA-Specific Optimizer Mixin (Backward Compatibility)

.. deprecated::
    This module has been moved to symfluence.models.summa.calibration.optimizer_mixin
    as part of the effort to consolidate model-specific code in the models package.

    This re-export is provided for backward compatibility. Please update imports to:

        from symfluence.models.summa.calibration import SUMMAOptimizerMixin

Migration Context:
    As part of the pre-migration refactoring to separate model-specific concerns,
    SUMMA-specific optimization code has been moved to the SUMMA model package.
    This establishes the pattern for the main migration where all model-specific
    optimizers, workers, parameter managers, and calibration targets will move to
    their respective model directories.
