"""
Shared utilities for model preprocessors.

Provides common functionality for time window management, forcing data
processing, data quality handling, and dataset alignment that is used
across multiple model preprocessors (SUMMA, FUSE, NGEN, GR, MESH).

Also includes RoutingDecider for unified routing decision logic across models.
