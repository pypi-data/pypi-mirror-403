"""
Differentiable Muskingum-Cunge River Routing.

Implements the Muskingum-Cunge method for channel routing in JAX,
enabling end-to-end gradient-based calibration of distributed
hydrological models.

The Muskingum-Cunge method is a physically-based routing scheme that:
1. Uses the continuity equation: dS/dt = I - Q
2. Relates storage to inflow/outflow: S = K[x*I + (1-x)*Q]
3. Derives K and x from channel hydraulics (vs. pure calibration)

Key Features:
- Fully differentiable (JAX autodiff compatible)
- Adaptive sub-stepping for Courant number stability
- Support for variable channel properties per reach
- Efficient vectorized operations
