Discretization attribute calculators.

This module provides calculators for deriving various geospatial attributes
used in hydrological model discretization including elevation, aspect,
land class, soil class, and radiation characteristics.

Each submodule provides a `discretize` function for its respective attribute.
Import submodules directly to access their discretize functions:

    from symfluence.geospatial.discretization.attributes import elevation
    result = elevation.discretize(discretizer)
