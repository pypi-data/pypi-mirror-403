"""
LSTM Model Calibration Module.

Provides calibration infrastructure for LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural
network hydrological models, supporting sequence-to-sequence learning.

Components:
    optimizer: LSTM-specific optimizer using PyTorch training loops
    parameter_manager: Manages LSTM hyperparameters (hidden size, layers, dropout)
    worker: Executes LSTM training runs with sequence batching

The calibration system supports:
- Hidden state dimension optimization
- Stacked LSTM layer configuration
- Dropout rate tuning for regularization
- Learning rate scheduling
- Early stopping with patience-based selection
- Entity-aware LSTM variants (EA-LSTM)
