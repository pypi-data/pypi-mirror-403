"""
Graph-based operations for river network analysis.

Provides NetworkX graph construction and upstream basin tracing.
Eliminates code duplication across GeofabricDelineator and GeofabricSubsetter.

Supports multiple hydrofabric formats:
- MERIT: COMID with up1, up2, up3 columns
- TDX: streamID/LINKNO with USLINKNO1, USLINKNO2 columns
- NWS: COMID with toCOMID column (reverse direction)

Refactored from geofabric_utils.py (2026-01-01)
