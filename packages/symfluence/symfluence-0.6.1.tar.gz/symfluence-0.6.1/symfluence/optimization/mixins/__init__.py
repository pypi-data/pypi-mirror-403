Optimization Mixins

Reusable mixin classes that provide common functionality for optimizers:
- ParallelExecutionMixin: Parallel processing infrastructure
- ResultsTrackingMixin: Results persistence and tracking
- RetryExecutionMixin: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- GradientOptimizationMixin: ADAM/LBFGS gradient-based optimization
- SUMMAOptimizerMixin: SUMMA-specific functionality (extracted from legacy BaseOptimizer)
