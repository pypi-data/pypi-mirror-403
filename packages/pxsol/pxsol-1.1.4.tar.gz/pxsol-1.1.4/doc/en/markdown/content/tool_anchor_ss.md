# Solana/More Developer Tools/A Simple Data-Storage Program in Anchor

Companion code for this chapter is here: <https://github.com/mohanson/pxsol-ss-anchor>.

In this section we'll build a data storage program with Anchor and walk through the flow from modeling to building. You'll see three key points: the accounts mental model, two instructions (init/update), and details around dynamic reallocation and rent. The code lives in `programs/pxsol-ss-anchor/src/lib.rs`, but we'll explain it conceptually here.

## Designing the Data Format

User data is stored in a PDA program-derived account. In our raw Rust version we didn't heavily constrain the data layout, serialization round-tripped and that was enough. With Anchor, we can define a struct annotated with `#[account]` that describes the storage. This helps development and makes on-chain analysis more straightforward.

```rust
#[account]
pub struct Data {
    pub auth: Pubkey, // The owner of this PDA account
    pub bump: u8,     // The bump used to derive the PDA
    pub data: Vec<u8> // The payload: arbitrary bytes
}

impl Data {
    pub fn space_for(data_len: usize) -> usize {
        // 8 (discriminator) + 32 (auth) + 1 (bump) + 4 (vec len) + data_len
        8 + 32 + 1 + 4 + data_len
    }
}
```

The `space_for()` method computes the required account size. It consists of five parts. We'll use it to calculate the rent-exempt minimum.

> Anchor-generated PDA accounts reserve the first 8 bytes of their data to tag the concrete account type, so Anchor can safely deserialize. The bytes come from `sha256("account:Data")`, taking the first 8 bytes; this prefix is the account discriminator. You can compute it with Python:

```py
import hashlib

r = hashlib.sha256(b'account:Data').digest()[:8]
print(list(r)) # [206, 156, 59, 188, 18, 79, 240, 232]
```

As a concrete example, if we store the bytes of "Hello World!", the PDA account will hold:

```text
discriminator: [206, 156, 59, 188, 18, 79, 240, 232]
         auth: [32 bytes of auth pubkey]
         bump: [1 byte of bump]
     data_len: [12, 0, 0, 0]
         data: [72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 87, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33]
```

## Instruction: Initialize the Program-Derived Account

We define two instructions: `init` and `update`. `init` initializes the PDA; `update` changes its content. Here's `init`, which records the authority, stores the bump, and sets the content to empty:

```rust
pub fn init(ctx: Context<Init>) -> Result<()> {
    let account_user = &ctx.accounts.user;
    let account_user_pda = &mut ctx.accounts.user_pda;
    account_user_pda.auth = account_user.key();
    account_user_pda.bump = ctx.bumps.user_pda;
    account_user_pda.data = Vec::new();
    Ok(())
}
```

After designing the instruction, we need to define its account list and account constraints.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Init<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = user,
        seeds = [SEED, user.key().as_ref()],
        bump,
        space = Data::space_for(0)
    )]
    pub user_pda: Account<'info, Data>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

At this point, the `data` field is empty, but the account has identity and ownership, and is rent-exempt.

Let's explain the meaning of these accounts and the constraints specified through `#[account(...)]`:

- `user` is the caller.
    - `Signer<'info>` indicates the basic account type, meaning it must sign because it pays the rent and transaction fees for creating the account.
    - `#[account(mut)]` means it is writable.
- `user_pda` is the PDA account to be created.
    - `Account<Data>` indicates the basic account type.
    - `#[account(init)]` marker indicates this account needs to be created in this instruction.
    - `#[account(payer = user)]` marks that the rent and transaction fees for creating user_pda are paid by user.
    - `#[account(seeds = [SEED, user.key().as_ref()])]` is the PDA's seed array; here we use a constant seed and the user's public key to derive a unique address.
    - `#[account(bump)]` lets Anchor automatically solve and record the bump for this PDA, used for signing and address uniqueness. It's typically always used together with seeds.
    - `#[account(space = Data::space_for(0))]` is the number of bytes reserved for the account.
- `system_program` is the system program.
    - `Program<'info, System>` represents the system program's account, allowing Anchor to invoke system instructions on your behalf (such as creating accounts, transferring, allocating space).

## Instruction: Store or Update Data

When updating, we allow the PDA to grow or shrink. Growing requires topping up rent; shrinking returns the surplus lamports to the owner. Think of it in three steps: authorization, reallocation, settlement. Anchor handles rent top-ups and fee debits for reallocation; you handle the refund when shrinking. That is, if new data is larger, Anchor pulls in lamports for rent automatically; if new data is smaller, you should refund excess lamports to the authority.

```rust
pub fn update(ctx: Context<Update>, data: Vec<u8>) -> Result<()> {
    let account_user = &ctx.accounts.user;
    let account_user_pda = &mut ctx.accounts.user_pda;

    // Update the data field with the new data.
    account_user_pda.data = data;

    // If the account was shrunk, Anchor won't automatically refund excess lamports. Refund any surplus (over the
    // new rent-exempt minimum) back to the user.
    let account_user_pda_info = account_user_pda.to_account_info();
    let rent_exemption = Rent::get()?.minimum_balance(account_user_pda_info.data_len());
    let hold = **account_user_pda_info.lamports.borrow();
    if hold > rent_exemption {
        let refund = hold.saturating_sub(rent_exemption);
        **account_user_pda_info.lamports.borrow_mut() = rent_exemption;
        **account_user.lamports.borrow_mut() = account_user.lamports().checked_add(refund).unwrap();
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

The corresponding accounts constraints make the instruction's strategies explicit:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(new_data: Vec<u8>)]
pub struct Update<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub user: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [SEED, user.key().as_ref()],
        bump = user_pda.bump,
        realloc = Data::space_for(new_data.len()),
        realloc::payer = user,
        realloc::zero = false,
        constraint = user_pda.auth == user.key() @ PxsolError::Unauthorized,
    )]
    pub user_pda: Account<'info, Data>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

Let's explain the meaning of these accounts and the constraints specified through `#[account(...)]`:

- `user` is the caller.
    - `Signer<'info>` indicates the basic account type, meaning it must sign.
    - `#[account(mut)]` means it is writable, because if the PDA account expands, user needs to top up the rent; if the PDA account shrinks, excess lamports will be refunded to user.
- `user_pda` is the PDA account to be updated.
    - `Account<Data>` indicates the basic account type.
    - `#[account(mut)]` means it is writable, because we need to modify its data content.
    - `#[account(seeds = [SEED, user.key().as_ref()])]` is the PDA's seed array, which must match the one used during creation to verify the correctness of the address derivation.
    - `#[account(bump = user_pda.bump)]` uses the bump value previously stored in the account to ensure the uniqueness and legitimacy of the PDA address. This bump was recorded during init.
    - `#[account(realloc = Data::space_for(new_data.len()))]` dynamically reallocates the account space. Anchor automatically adjusts the account size based on the new data length. If the new space is larger than the old space, additional rent will be deducted from `realloc::payer`; if the new space is smaller than the old space, the account will shrink, but excess lamports will not be automatically refunded (they need to be handled manually in the instruction logic).
    - `#[account(realloc::payer = user)]` specifies that when the account needs to expand, the additional rent is paid by user. If user has insufficient balance, the transaction will fail.
    - `#[account(realloc::zero = false)]` indicates that newly allocated bytes do not need to be zeroed during reallocation. Setting it to false saves compute units because we will immediately overwrite these bytes with new data. If you need to ensure that the new space is initialized to zero, set it to true.
    - `#[account(constraint = user_pda.auth == user.key() @ PxsolError::Unauthorized)]` is a custom constraint check that verifies the caller user's public key must match the auth field stored in the PDA account. If they don't match, a `PxsolError::Unauthorized` error will be thrown. This is a critical permission check ensuring only the account owner can update the data.
- `system_program` is the system program.
    - `Program<'info, System>` represents the system program's account, used for account reallocation and lamports transfer operations.

## Wrap-up

Our Anchor-based storage program is simple, but it ties together the most common capabilities: account constraints, dynamic reallocation, and PDA signing. Once it runs end-to-end, you can layer on more complex logic. The total code is under 100 lines, an excellent starting point that you can understand quickly, so we won't belabor it here.
