    @public

    FlowDocument is used for data that needs to be saved between pipeline
    steps and across multiple flow executions. These documents are typically
    written to the file system using the deployment utilities.

    Key characteristics:
    - Persisted to file system between pipeline steps
    - Survives across multiple flow runs
    - Used for flow inputs and outputs
    - Saved in directories organized by the document's type/name

    Creating FlowDocuments:
        Same as Document - use `create()` for automatic conversion, `__init__` for bytes.
        See Document.create() for detailed usage examples.

    Persistence:
        Documents are saved under an output directory path associated with the document's type/name.
        For example: output/my_doc/data.json

    Note:
        - Cannot instantiate FlowDocument directly - must subclass
        - Used with FlowConfig to define flow input/output types
        - No additional abstract methods to implement
