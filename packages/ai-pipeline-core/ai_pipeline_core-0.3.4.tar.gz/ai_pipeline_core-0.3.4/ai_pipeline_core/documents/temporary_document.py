    r"""Concrete document class for data that is never persisted.

    TemporaryDocument is a final (non-subclassable) document type for
    data that should never be saved to disk, regardless of whether it's
    used in a flow or task context. Unlike FlowDocument and TaskDocument
    which are abstract, TemporaryDocument can be instantiated directly.

    Key characteristics:
    - Never persisted to file system
    - Can be instantiated directly (not abstract)
    - Cannot be subclassed (annotated with Python's @final decorator in code)
    - Useful for transient data like API responses or intermediate calculations
    - Ignored by deployment save operations
    - Useful for tests and debugging

    Creating TemporaryDocuments:
        Same as Document - use `create()` for automatic conversion, `__init__` for bytes.
        Unlike abstract document types, TemporaryDocument can be instantiated directly.
        See Document.create() for detailed usage examples.

        >>> doc = TemporaryDocument.create(name="api.json", content={"status": "ok"})
        >>> doc.is_temporary  # Always True

    Use Cases:
        - API responses that shouldn't be cached
        - Sensitive credentials or tokens
        - Intermediate calculations
        - Temporary transformations
        - Data explicitly marked as non-persistent

    Note:
        - This is a final class and cannot be subclassed
        - Use when you explicitly want to prevent persistence
        - Useful for sensitive data that shouldn't be written to disk
