        Set the Distributed Session Cace configuration.

        Args:
            client_grace (int): The length of time (in seconds) that a client (aka WebSEAL) has to 
                                reconnect before sessions owned by that client are discarded.
            connection_idle_timeout (int): The maximum length of time that a connection from a client can 
                                            remain idle before it is closed by the server. A value of 0 
                                            indicates that connections will not be reused.
            max_session_lifetime (int): The maximum lifetime (in seconds) of any session stored by the DSC.
            service_port (int): The port number on which the DSC will listen for requests.
            replication_port (int): The port number on which the DSC will listen for replication requests.
            ssl_ciphers (:obj:`str`, optional): The comma separated list of permissted SSL algorithms 
                                                for TLS connections to the DSC.
            tls12_cipher_specs (:obj:`str`, optional): The comma separated list of permissted TLS1.2 cipher specs 
                                                       permitted for established TLS connections.
            tls13_cipher_specs (:obj:`str`, optional): The comma separated list of permissted TLS1.3 cipher specs 
                                                       permitted for established TLS connections.
            worker_threads (int): The number of worker threads allocated to processing requests.
            servers (:obj:`dict`): The external connection data for each instance of the DSC. This 
                                    corresponds to the IP address and ports to which clients will connect. 
                                    Up to 4 servers may be defined (primary, secondary, tertiary and 
                                    quaternary). The role of the server will be determined by the order 
                                    of elements within the servers array.
