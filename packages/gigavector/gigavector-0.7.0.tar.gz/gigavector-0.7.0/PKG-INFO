## API Reference

### Database

The main class for vector database operations.

#### `Database.open(path, dimension, index=IndexType.KDTREE)`

Create or open a database instance.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (str | None): File path for persistent storage. Use `None` for in-memory database.
- `dimension` (int): Vector dimension (must be consistent for all vectors).
- `index` (IndexType): Index type to use. Defaults to `IndexType.KDTREE`.

**Returns:** `Database` instance

**Example:**
```python
# In-memory database
db = Database.open(None, dimension=128, index=IndexType.HNSW)

# Persistent database
db = Database.open("vectors.db", dimension=128, index=IndexType.KDTREE)
```

#### `add_vector(vector, metadata=None)`

Add a single vector to the database.

**Parameters:**
- `vector` (Sequence[float]): Vector data as a sequence of floats. Length must match database dimension.
- `metadata` (dict[str, str] | None): Optional dictionary of key-value metadata pairs.

**Raises:**
- `ValueError`: If vector dimension doesn't match database dimension.
- `RuntimeError`: If insertion fails.

**Example:**
```python
# Vector without metadata
db.add_vector([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Vector with single metadata entry
db.add_vector([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], metadata={"id": "123"})

# Vector with multiple metadata entries
db.add_vector([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], metadata={
    "id": "123",
    "category": "electronics",
    "price": "99.99"
})
```

#### `add_vectors(vectors)`

Add multiple vectors to the database in batch. Vectors added via this method cannot include metadata.

**Parameters:**
- `vectors` (Iterable[Sequence[float]]): Iterable of vectors. All vectors must have the same dimension.

**Raises:**
- `ValueError`: If vectors have inconsistent dimensions.
- `RuntimeError`: If batch insertion fails.

**Example:**
```python
vectors = [
    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
    [4.0, 5.0, 6.0],
    [7.0, 8.0, 9.0]
]
db.add_vectors(vectors)
```

#### `search(query, k, distance=DistanceType.EUCLIDEAN, filter_metadata=None)`

Search for k nearest neighbors to a query vector.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (Sequence[float]): Query vector. Length must match database dimension.
- `k` (int): Number of nearest neighbors to return.
- `distance` (DistanceType): Distance metric to use. Defaults to `DistanceType.EUCLIDEAN`.
- `filter_metadata` (tuple[str, str] | None): Optional metadata filter as (key, value) tuple. Only vectors matching the filter are considered.

**Returns:** `list[SearchHit]` - List of search results, ordered by distance (ascending).

**Raises:**
- `ValueError`: If query dimension doesn't match database dimension.
- `RuntimeError`: If search fails.

**Example:**
```python
# Basic search
hits = db.search([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], k=5, distance=DistanceType.EUCLIDEAN)

# Search with metadata filter
hits = db.search(
    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
    k=5,
    distance=DistanceType.EUCLIDEAN,
    filter_metadata=("category", "electronics")
)
```

#### `search_batch(queries, k, distance=DistanceType.EUCLIDEAN)`

Search for k nearest neighbors for multiple query vectors in batch.

**Parameters:**
- `queries` (Iterable[Sequence[float]]): Iterable of query vectors.
- `k` (int): Number of nearest neighbors to return per query.
- `distance` (DistanceType): Distance metric to use. Defaults to `DistanceType.EUCLIDEAN`.

**Returns:** `list[list[SearchHit]]` - List of search result lists, one per query.

**Raises:**
- `ValueError`: If any query dimension doesn't match database dimension.
- `RuntimeError`: If batch search fails.

**Example:**
```python
queries = [
    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
    [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
]
results = db.search_batch(queries, k=5)
for i, hits in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Query {i}: {len(hits)} results")
```

#### `save(path=None)`

Persist the database to a binary snapshot file. If a file path was provided when opening the database, writes to that path. Otherwise, use the provided path.

**Parameters:**
- `path` (str | None): Optional file path. If None and database was opened with a path, uses that path.

**Raises:**
- `RuntimeError`: If save operation fails.

**Example:**
```python
# Save to the path used when opening
db.save()

# Save to a different path
db.save("backup.db")
```

#### `train_ivfpq(data)`

Train the IVFPQ index with training vectors. Only applicable when using `IndexType.IVFPQ`.

**Parameters:**
- `data` (Sequence[Sequence[float]]): Training vectors. All vectors must match the database dimension.

**Raises:**
- `ValueError`: If training data is empty or dimensions don't match.
- `RuntimeError`: If training fails.

**Example:**
```python
# Train with at least 256 vectors (recommended)
train_data = [[(i % 10) / 10.0 for _ in range(128)] for i in range(256)]
db.train_ivfpq(train_data)
```

#### `close()`

Close the database and release resources. Automatically called when using the context manager.

**Example:**
```python
db = Database.open(None, dimension=128)
# ... use database ...
db.close()
```

### IndexType

- `IndexType.HNSW`: Hierarchical Navigable Small World graph. Good for high-dimensional data with fast approximate search.
- `IndexType.IVFPQ`: Inverted File with Product Quantization. Memory-efficient for large-scale datasets. Requires training before use.

### DistanceType

Enumeration of distance metrics.

- `DistanceType.EUCLIDEAN`: Euclidean (L2) distance.
- `DistanceType.COSINE`: Cosine similarity distance.

### Vector

Data class representing a vector with metadata.

**Attributes:**
- `data` (list[float]): Vector data.
- `metadata` (dict[str, str]): Dictionary of metadata key-value pairs.

### SearchHit

Data class representing a search result.

**Attributes:**
- `distance` (float): Distance from the query vector.
- `vector` (Vector): The matched vector with its metadata.

## Usage Examples

### Persistent Storage with WAL

```python
from gigavector import Database, IndexType, DistanceType

# Create a persistent database
with Database.open("vectors.db", dimension=128, index=IndexType.KDTREE) as db:
    db.add_vector([0.1] * 128, metadata={"id": "1", "tag": "A"})
    db.add_vector([0.2] * 128, metadata={"id": "2", "tag": "B"})
    db.save()  # Create snapshot

# Reopen - WAL automatically replays any uncommitted changes
with Database.open("vectors.db", dimension=128, index=IndexType.KDTREE) as db:
    hits = db.search([0.1] * 128, k=5)
    # All vectors are restored, including metadata
```

### IVFPQ Index with Training

```python
from gigavector import Database, IndexType, DistanceType
import random

# Create IVFPQ database
db = Database.open(None, dimension=64, index=IndexType.IVFPQ)

# Generate training data (at least 256 vectors recommended)
train_data = [
    [random.random() for _ in range(64)]
    for _ in range(256)
]
db.train_ivfpq(train_data)

# Add vectors
with db:
    for i in range(1000):
        vec = [random.random() for _ in range(64)]
        db.add_vector(vec, metadata={"id": str(i)})
    
    # Search
    query = [random.random() for _ in range(64)]
    hits = db.search(query, k=10, distance=DistanceType.EUCLIDEAN)
```

### Metadata Filtering

```python
from gigavector import Database, IndexType, DistanceType

with Database.open(None, dimension=128, index=IndexType.HNSW) as db:
    # Add vectors with different categories
    db.add_vector([0.1] * 128, metadata={"category": "A", "price": "10"})
    db.add_vector([0.2] * 128, metadata={"category": "B", "price": "20"})
    db.add_vector([0.15] * 128, metadata={"category": "A", "price": "15"})
    
    # Search only in category A
    hits = db.search(
        [0.1] * 128,
        k=10,
        distance=DistanceType.EUCLIDEAN,
        filter_metadata=("category", "A")
    )
    # Returns only vectors with category="A"
```

### Batch Operations

```python
from gigavector import Database, IndexType, DistanceType

with Database.open(None, dimension=128, index=IndexType.KDTREE) as db:
    # Batch insert vectors (without metadata)
    vectors = [[i * 0.01] * 128 for i in range(1000)]
    db.add_vectors(vectors)
    
    # Batch search
    queries = [[i * 0.01] * 128 for i in range(10)]
    results = db.search_batch(queries, k=5)
    for i, hits in enumerate(results):
        print(f"Query {i}: {len(hits)} results")
```
