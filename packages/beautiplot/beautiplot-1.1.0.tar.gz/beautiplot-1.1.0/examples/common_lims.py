# # Common y-limits
#
# This example demonstrates how to set common y-limits for multiple
# subplots in a grid layout using the `beautiplot` library. This is
# particularly useful when you want to compare data across different
# subplots and ensure that the y-axis scales are consistent, especially
# when there are multiple subplots with different data ranges.
#
# We start by importing the necessary libraries and defining the
# configuration for the plots.

from pathlib import Path

import numpy as np

import beautiplot.plot as bp
from beautiplot import config

root = Path(__file__).parent.parent
config.output_path = root / 'docs/example_plots'

# Next, we define the data for the subplots. In this example, we create
# four subplots, each with different sine and cosine functions. The x
# values are the same for all subplots, but the y values differ.

x = np.linspace(0, 7, 100)
y1 = np.sin(x)
y2 = 2 * np.cos(x)
y3 = 3 * np.sin(x)
y4 = 4 * np.cos(x)

# We then create a new figure with a grid of subplots using the
# [`newfig`][beautiplot.plot.newfig] function. In the beginning, you
# need to guess the margins and spacing, but you can adjust them later
# if needed.
#
# `beautiplot` will suggest margin adjustments when saving the figure.
# Keep in mind that these adjustments might affect tick labels, so
# fixing tick locations can help avoid a cycle of suggestions.

fig, axes = bp.newfig(nrows=2, ncols=2, left=23, bottom=18)

# Next, we plot the data on each subplot. We also remove the x-tick
# labels for the first row and the y-tick labels for the second column
# to make the plots cleaner.

axes[0, 0].plot(x, y1, label=r'$\sin(x)$')
axes[0, 0].set_xticklabels([])
axes[0, 1].plot(x, y2, label=r'$2\cdot\cos(x)$')
axes[0, 1].set_xticklabels([])
axes[0, 1].set_yticklabels([])
axes[1, 0].plot(x, y3, label=r'$3\cdot\sin(x)$')
axes[1, 1].plot(x, y4, label=r'$4\cdot\cos(x)$')
axes[1, 1].set_yticklabels([])

# We add legends to each subplot to identify the functions plotted.

for ax in axes.flat:
    bp.legend(ax)

# Now, we can set common y-limits for each row of subplots. This ensures
# that the y-axis scales are consistent across the subplots in each row.

bp.common_lims('y', axes[0, :])
bp.common_lims('y', axes[1, :])
bp.save_figure(fig, 'common_lims_rows.png')

# ![common_lims_rows.png](../example_plots/common_lims_rows.png)
#
# Alternatively, we can set common y-limits for all subplots in the
# grid. This is useful when you want to compare all subplots directly.

bp.common_lims('y', axes)
bp.save_figure(fig, 'common_lims.png')
