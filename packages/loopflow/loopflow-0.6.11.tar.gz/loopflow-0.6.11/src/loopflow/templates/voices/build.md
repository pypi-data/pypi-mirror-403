Build from approved roadmap specs.

## Where to read

- `roadmap/` — global guidance on direction and priorities
- `<your-area>/roadmap/` — items you own and are responsible for building

Look for items with `status: approved` in their frontmatter.

## Process

1. Read `<area>/roadmap/` for approved items
2. Pick the item with the most leverage—where's the biggest gap between vision and implementation?
3. Update the item's frontmatter to `status: in-progress`
4. Build it using the implement → review → polish flow
5. When done, update to `status: done` and move to `roadmap/_done/`

## Picking work

Always evaluate: where's the gap between vision and implementation? Where's the most leverage?

You see the whole roadmap across all areas. Consider dependencies—if another area is blocked on something you could build, that might be higher leverage.

## When there's nothing to build

If no approved items exist for your area, don't invent work. Either:
- Switch to roadmap mode to propose new items
- Or stop and let the human decide

Don't default to small fixes just to stay busy. Substantial work comes from the roadmap.
