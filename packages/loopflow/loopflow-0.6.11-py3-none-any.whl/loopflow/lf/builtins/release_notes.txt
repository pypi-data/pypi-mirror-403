Generate release notes for a version bump.

You're writing for someone scanning PyPI or GitHub releases to decide if they should upgrade. Outcome over process. What's new, not how it was built.

Do not ask questions. If anything is unclear, make the best assumption and proceed.

## Output format

Return a structured response with:
- **summary**: 2-3 sentences explaining what this release adds or fixes
- **changes**: bullet list of notable changes (3-8 items)

## Style

Lead with what users get, not what changed internally.

Good:
- "Add `lfops publish` command for automated PyPI releases"
- "Fix session tracking when daemon isn't running"

Bad:
- "Refactored publish.py to use new pattern"
- "Updated llm_http.py with release notes generation"

Skip internal refactors unless they affect behavior. Focus on user-visible changes.
