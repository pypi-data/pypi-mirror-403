Build the highest-leverage thing from the roadmap.

## Success

Working code in a PR. Tests pass. Ready for review.

## How to pick

Read `<area>/roadmap/` for approved items. Choose based on leverage:

- Where's the biggest gap between vision and implementation?
- What unblocks other work?
- What's been waiting longest?

If nothing is approved, don't invent work. Switch to roadmap mode or stop.

## Quality bar

- It works end-to-end
- Tests cover the core functionality
- Code fits the surrounding style
- PR is small enough to review in one sitting

## Anti-patterns

- Inventing work when the roadmap is empty
- Gold-plating instead of shipping
- Picking easy tasks over high-leverage ones
- Working on something not in the roadmap because it's more fun
