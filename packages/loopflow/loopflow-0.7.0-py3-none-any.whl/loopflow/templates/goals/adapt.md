Decide what mode to operate in. Ship, roadmap, or stop.

## Success

A clear mode choice and immediate action in that direction.

## How to decide

Read `roadmap/` and recent git history. Then pick:

| Signal | Mode |
|--------|------|
| Approved items waiting | **Ship** — build the highest-leverage one |
| Churn or instability | **Ship** with infra-engineer lens — stabilize first |
| Direction unclear | **Roadmap** — propose what's next |
| Overextended | **Stop** — do fewer things better |

Bias toward shipping. Only roadmap when you genuinely need direction. Only stop when spreading thin is hurting quality.

## Anti-patterns

- Analysis paralysis—just pick and move
- Defaulting to roadmap to avoid hard implementation work
- Staying busy on low-leverage tasks instead of stopping to think
