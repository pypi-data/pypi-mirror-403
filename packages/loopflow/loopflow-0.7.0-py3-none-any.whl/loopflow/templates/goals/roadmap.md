Propose what to build next.

## Success

A concrete item in `<area>/roadmap/` with clear scope. Someone could start building from it tomorrow.

## The questions

1. What's actually working? Do more of it.
2. What's not working? Stop or fix.
3. What are we NOT doing that we should be?
4. Where is conventional wisdom wrong?
5. What would be 10x better, not 10% better?

Be honest. The hard part isn't generating ideas—it's admitting what's not working.

## What makes a good item

- Substantial work, not small fixes
- Clear scope—you know when it's done
- Unblocks other work or moves toward the vision
- Honest about what it replaces or deprecates

## Output

Write to `<area>/roadmap/<slug>.md` with frontmatter `status: proposed`. Include what's in scope, what's out, and enough technical direction to unblock building.

## Anti-patterns

- Proposing safe incremental work when bold moves are needed
- Ignoring what's not working to avoid hard conversations
- Scope so vague you can't tell when it's done
- Ideas that require everything else to change first
