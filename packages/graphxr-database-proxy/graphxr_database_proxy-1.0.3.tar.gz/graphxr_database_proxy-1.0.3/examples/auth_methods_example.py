GraphXR Database Proxy - Service Account Authentication Methods Example

This example demonstrates different ways to use Service Account authentication:
1. File Path Method - Pass the path to the JSON file
2. JSON String Method - Pass the Service Account JSON content directly
3. Environment Variable Method - Get JSON from environment variables

All methods support the same functionality. Choose the appropriate method 
based on your deployment environment and security requirements.
