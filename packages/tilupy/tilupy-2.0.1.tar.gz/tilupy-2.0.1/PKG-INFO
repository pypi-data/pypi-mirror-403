License: CeCILL-C FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
        
        
            Notice
        
        This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
        of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
        the two main principles guiding its drafting:
        
            * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
              of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to
              users,
            * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which
              it is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and
              intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to
              both authors and holders of the economic rights over software.
        
        The authors of the CeCILL-C (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[ogiciel] L[ibre])
        license are:
        
        Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical
        and industrial research establishment, having its principal place of
        business at 25 rue Leblanc, immeuble Le Ponant D, 75015 Paris, France.
        
        Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique - CNRS, a public scientific
        and technological establishment, having its principal place of business
        at 3 rue Michel-Ange, 75794 Paris cedex 16, France.

        principal place of business at Domaine de Voluceau, Rocquencourt, BP
        105, 78153 Le Chesnay cedex, France.
        
        
            Preamble
        
        The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
        the right to modify and re-use the software governed by this license.
        
        The exercising of this right is conditional upon the obligation to make
        available to the community the modifications made to the source code of
        the software so as to contribute to its evolution.
        
        In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
        modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
        with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the
        economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
        
        In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
        and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
        the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
        complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
        developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
        knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
        suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
        enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
        more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
        security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
        provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
        removed herefrom.
        
        This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of
        the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.

              5.1 RIGHT OF USE
        
        The Licensee is authorized to use the Software, without any limitation
        as to its fields of application, with it being hereinafter specified
        that this comprises:
        
           1. permanent or temporary reproduction of all or part of the Software
              by any or all means and in any or all form.
        
           2. loading, displaying, running, or storing the Software on any or

           3. entitlement to observe, study or test its operation so as to
              determine the ideas and principles behind any or all constituent
              elements of said Software. This shall apply when the Licensee
              carries out any or all loading, displaying, running, transmission
              or storage operation as regards the Software, that it is entitled
              to carry out hereunder.
        
        
              5.2 RIGHT OF MODIFICATION
        
        The right of modification includes the right to translate, adapt,
        arrange, or make any or all modifications to the Software, and the right
        to reproduce the resulting software. It includes, in particular, the

        author of said modification and indicates the date of the creation thereof.
        
        
              5.3 RIGHT OF DISTRIBUTION
        
        In particular, the right of distribution includes the right to publish,
        transmit and communicate the Software to the general public on any or
        all medium, and by any or all means, and the right to market, either in
        consideration of a fee, or free of charge, one or more copies of the
        Software by any means.
        
        The Licensee is further authorized to distribute copies of the modified
        or unmodified Software to third parties according to the terms and
        conditions set forth hereinafter.
        
        
                5.3.1 DISTRIBUTION OF SOFTWARE WITHOUT MODIFICATION
        
        The Licensee is authorized to distribute true copies of the Software in
        Source Code or Object Code form, provided that said distribution
        complies with all the provisions of the Agreement and is accompanied by:
        
           1. a copy of the Agreement,
        
           2. a notice relating to the limitation of both the Licensor's
              warranty and liability as set forth in Articles 8 and 9,
        
        and that, in the event that only the Object Code of the Software is
        redistributed, the Licensee allows effective access to the full Source
        Code of the Software at a minimum during the entire period of its
        distribution of the Software, it being understood that the additional
        cost of acquiring the Source Code shall not exceed the cost of
        transferring the data.
        
        
                5.3.2 DISTRIBUTION OF MODIFIED SOFTWARE
        
        When the Licensee makes an Integrated Contribution to the Software, the
        terms and conditions for the distribution of the resulting Modified
        Software become subject to all the provisions of this Agreement.
        
        The Licensee is authorized to distribute the Modified Software, in
        source code or object code form, provided that said distribution
        complies with all the provisions of the Agreement and is accompanied by:
        
           1. a copy of the Agreement,
        
           2. a notice relating to the limitation of both the Licensor's
              warranty and liability as set forth in Articles 8 and 9,
        
        and that, in the event that only the object code of the Modified
        Software is redistributed, the Licensee allows effective access to the
        full source code of the Modified Software at a minimum during the entire
        period of its distribution of the Modified Software, it being understood
        that the additional cost of acquiring the source code shall not exceed
        the cost of transferring the data.
        
        
                5.3.3 DISTRIBUTION OF DERIVATIVE SOFTWARE
        
        When the Licensee creates Derivative Software, this Derivative Software
        may be distributed under a license agreement other than this Agreement,
        subject to compliance with the requirement to include a notice
        concerning the rights over the Software as defined in Article 6.4.
        In the event the creation of the Derivative Software required modification 
        of the Source Code, the Licensee undertakes that:
        
           1. the resulting Modified Software will be governed by this Agreement,
           2. the Integrated Contributions in the resulting Modified Software
              will be clearly identified and documented,
           3. the Licensee will allow effective access to the source code of the
              Modified Software, at a minimum during the entire period of
              distribution of the Derivative Software, such that such
              modifications may be carried over in a subsequent version of the
              Software; it being understood that the additional cost of
              purchasing the source code of the Modified Software shall not
              exceed the cost of transferring the data.
        
        
                5.3.4 COMPATIBILITY WITH THE CeCILL LICENSE
        
        When a Modified Software contains an Integrated Contribution subject to
        the CeCILL license agreement, or when a Derivative Software contains a
        Related Module subject to the CeCILL license agreement, the provisions
        set forth in the third item of Article 6.4 are optional.
        
        
            Article 6 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
        
        
              6.1 OVER THE INITIAL SOFTWARE
        
        The Holder owns the economic rights over the Initial Software. Any or
        all use of the Initial Software is subject to compliance with the terms
        and conditions under which the Holder has elected to distribute its work
        and no one shall be entitled to modify the terms and conditions for the
        distribution of said Initial Software.
        
        The Holder undertakes that the Initial Software will remain ruled at
        least by this Agreement, for the duration set forth in Article 4.2.
        
        
              6.2 OVER THE INTEGRATED CONTRIBUTIONS
        
        The Licensee who develops an Integrated Contribution is the owner of the
        intellectual property rights over this Contribution as defined by
        applicable law.
        
        
              6.3 OVER THE RELATED MODULES
        
        The Licensee who develops a Related Module is the owner of the
        intellectual property rights over this Related Module as defined by
        applicable law and is free to choose the type of agreement that shall
        govern its distribution under the conditions defined in Article 5.3.3.
        
        
              6.4 NOTICE OF RIGHTS
        
        The Licensee expressly undertakes:
        
           1. not to remove, or modify, in any manner, the intellectual property
              notices attached to the Software;
        
           2. to reproduce said notices, in an identical manner, in the copies
              of the Software modified or not;
        
           3. to ensure that use of the Software, its intellectual property
              notices and the fact that it is governed by the Agreement is
              indicated in a text that is easily accessible, specifically from
              the interface of any Derivative Software.
        
        The Licensee undertakes not to directly or indirectly infringe the
        intellectual property rights of the Holder and/or Contributors on the
        Software and to take, where applicable, vis-à-vis its staff, any and all
        measures required to ensure respect of said intellectual property rights
        of the Holder and/or Contributors.
        
        
            Article 7 - RELATED SERVICES
        
        7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to
        provide technical assistance or maintenance services for the Software.
        
        However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The
        terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such
        maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the
        Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services
        shall incur liability therefor.
        
        7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under
        its sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon
        itself, for the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified
        Software, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said
        warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application,
        shall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor
        and the Licensee.
        
        
            Article 8 - LIABILITY
        
        8.1 Subject to the provisions of Article 8.2, the Licensee shall be
        entitled to claim compensation for any direct loss it may have suffered
        from the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant
        Licensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.
        
        8.2 The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under
        this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular:
        (i) loss due the Licensee's total or partial failure to fulfill its
        obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the
        Licensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more
        generally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly
        agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,
        loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,
        opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all
        legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,
        shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to
        any or all compensation from the Licensor.
        
        
            Article 9 - WARRANTY
        
        9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
        state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
        possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
        possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's
        attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
        modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
        reserved for experienced users.
        
        The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
        the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working
        order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons
        or properties.
        
        9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
        to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
        rights set forth in Article 5).
        
        9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by
        the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
        that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty
        as to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant
        nature.
        
        Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
        from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will
        be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software
        configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.
        
        9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
        Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
        relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
        the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
        arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be
        instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the
        Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
        the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal
        assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be
        decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the
        Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor
        disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the
        name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of
        prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence
        of a trademark.
        
        
            Article 10 - TERMINATION
        
        10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations
        hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement
        thirty (30) days after notice has been sent to the Licensee and has
        remained ineffective.
        
        10.2 A Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be
        authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any
        licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement
        shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance
        with the terms and conditions hereof.

## Description <a name="description"></a>

`tilupy` (ThIn-Layer Unified Processing in pYthon) package is meant as a top-level tool for processing inputs and outputs of thin-layer geophysical
flow simulations on general topographies.
It contains one submodule per thin-layer model for writing and reading raw inputs and outputs of the model. 
Outputs are then easily compared between different simulations / models. The models themselves are not part of this package and must
be installed separately.

Note that `tilupy` is still under development, thus only minimal documentation is available at the moment, and testing is underway.
Contributions are feedback are most welcome. Reading and writing is available for the `SHALTOP` model (most commonly used by the author) and `r.avaflow`
(only partly maintained).

## Installation with pip <a name="installation-pip"></a>

To install `tilupy` from GitHub or PyPi, you'll need to have `pip` installed on your computer. 

It is strongly recommended to install `tilupy` in a virtual environnement dedicated to this package. This can be done with `virtualenv`
(see the documentation e.g. [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)).
Create the environnement with :

```bash
python -m venv /path/to/myenv
```

and activate it, on Linux:

```bash
source /path/to/myenv/bin/activate
```

and on Windows:

```cmd.exe
\path\to\myenv\Scripts\activate
```

Alternatively, if you are more used to Anaconda :

```bash
conda create -n tilupy pip
conda activate tilupy
```

or equivalently with Mamba :

```bash
mamba create -n tilupy pip
mamba activate tilupy
```

Before installing with `pip`, make sure `pip`, `steuptools` and `wheel` are up to date

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```

### Latest stable realease from PyPi <a name="pypi-install"></a>

```
python -m pip install tilupy
```

### Development version on from GitHub <a name="source-install"></a>

Download the GithHub repository [here](https://github.com/marcperuz/tilupy), or clone it with

```
git clone https://github.com/marcperuz/tilupy.git
```

Open a terminal in the created folder and type:

```
python -m pip install .
```

## Installation with from conda-forge <a name="installation-conda"></a>

The latest stable version of `tilupy` on PyPi is also (supposedly) distributed on `conda-forge`. It can be intalled with Anaconda (or any equivalent) with

```
conda install conda-forge::tilupy
```

## Quick start <a name="quick-start"></a>

We give here a simple example to prepare simulations for SHALTOP, and process the results. The corresponding scripts can be found in `examples/frankslide`

### Prepare simulations <a name="prepare-simus"></a>

See the online documentation on [ReadTheDocs](https://tilupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/auto_examples/preprocessing/make_simus.html) 

### Get simulation results <a name="simu-results"></a>

Simulation results are read from a `Results` class. Main functions are defined in the parent class `tilupy.read.Results`, and each model has its own inheretied class `tilupy.models.[model_name].read.Results`. A class instance for a given model can be initiated with

```python
res = tilupy.read.get_results([model_name], **kwargs)
```

where `kwargs must be adapted to the considered model. For instance with Shaltop you must provide the folder containing the parameter file, and the name of the parameter file:

```python
res = tilupy.read.get_results('shaltop', folder=folder_simus, file_params='params.txt')
```

The topography and axes can then directly be read from `res` :

```python
x, y, z = res.x, res.y, res.z
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.imshow(z)
```

`z[i, j]` is the altitude at `flip(y[i])` and `x[j]`. Thus `z[0, 0]` corresponds to the North-West corner of the topography. 

Specific simulation outputs can be extracted with 

```python
h_res = res.get_output(res_name)
```

where `res_name` must chosen among

- `h` : Flow thickness in the direction perpendicular to the topography
- `hvert` : Flow thickness in the vertical direction
- `ux` and `uy` : Flow velocity in the X and Y direction (check whether it is in the cartesian reference frame or not)
- `u` : Norm of the flow velocity
- `hu` : Momentum (thickness * flow velocity)
- `hu2` : Kinetic energy (thickness * square flow velocity)

It is also possible to extract 2D spatial static characteritics of the flow by using any of the previous states with `_[operation]`, where
`[operation]` is chosen among, `max`, `mean`, `std`, `sum`, `min`, `final`, `initial`. For instance `h_max` is a 2D array with the
maximum simulated thickness at each point of the grid. `h_final` is the simulated thickness at the end of the simulation.
`tilupy` will load these characteristics directly from the simulation output when possible (e.g. Shaltop records a maximum thickness array),
or compute then from the available data. For instance, if the simulation results contains a file whith the maximum thickness, `h_max` will be
read from this file. Otherwise, `h_max` is computed from the simulation recorded temporal snapshots (which is supposedly less precise).

For instance, to load the recorded thicknesses in the current example :

```python
res_name = 'h' 
h_res = res.get_output(res_name) # Thicknesses recorded at different times
# h_res.d is a 3D numpy array of dimension (len(x) x len(y) x len(h_res.t))
plt.imshow(h_res.d[:, :, -1]) # Plot final thickness.
t = h_res.t # Get times of simulation outputs.
```

And to load the maximum thickness array :

```python
res_name = 'h_max'
h_max_res = res.get_output(res_name) #h_max_res is read directly from simulation
# results when possible, and is deduced from res.get_output('h') otherwise
# h_max_res.d is a 2D numpy array of dimension (len(x) x len(y))
plt.imshow(h_max_res.d)
```

### Process simulation results in python script <a name="process-simus-python"></a>

`tilupy`can be used to plot the results as images, where the flow state (thickness, velocity, ...)
is shown with a colorscale on the underlying topography. Plots can be thouroughly customized (documentation not available yet).

For instance, the following code plots the flow thickness at each recorded time step, with a constant colorscale vraying from 0.1 to
100 m. The topography is represented as a shaded relief with thin contour lines every 10 m, and bold contour_lines every 100 m. Plots are saved
in a folder created in `folder_out`, but not displayed in the terminal (if you work in a developping environnement such as `spyder`).

```python
topo_kwargs = dict(contour_step=10, step_contour_bold=100) # give interval between thin and bold contour lines
params_files = 'delta_*.txt'
tilupy.cmd.plot_results('shaltop', 'h', params_files, folder_simus,
                        save=True, display_plot=False, figsize=(15/2.54, 15/2.54),
                        vmin=0.1, vmax=100, fmt='png',
                        topo_kwargs=topo_kwargs)
```

The following code acts similarly, but plots the maximum thickness instead, and used a segmented colormap given by `cmap_intervals`.

```python
tilupy.cmd.plot_results('shaltop', 'h_max', params_files, folder_simus,
                        save=True, display_plot=False, figsize=(15/2.54, 15/2.54),
                        cmap_intervals=[0.1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100],
                        topo_kwargs=topo_kwargs)
```

It is also possible to save outputs back to rasters. The following code save all recorded thicknesses snapshots as tif files in a new folder
created in `folder_out`.

```python
tilupy.cmd.to_raster('shaltop', 'h_max', params_files,
                     folder_simus, fmt='tif')
```

### Process simulation results in command line <a name="process-simus-cmd"></a>

`tilupy` comes with command line scripts to allow for quick processing of results. They work similarly as the functions `tilupy.cmd.plot_results` and `tilupy.cmd.to_raster`, 
although there are less options. 

`tilupy_plot` will automatically plot and save results in a new folder `plot` located in the simulation output folder specified in the parameter file :

```
tilupy_plot [-h] [-n RES_NAME] [-p PARAM_FILES] [-f FOLDER] [--fmt FMT] [--vmin VMIN] [--vmax VMAX]
                   [--minval_abs MINVAL_ABS]
                   [model]
```

`RES_NAME` can be any of the strings listed in the previous section. For instance, to plot all thicknesses snaphsots from shaltop simulations in the current folder, type `tilupy_plot shaltop -n h`. If parameters files are located in `another/folder`, type, `tilupy shaltop -n h -f another/folder`. Similarly, to save  thicknesses snapshots as ascii rasters, use `tilupy_to_raster shaltop -n h --fmt asc`.

```
tilupy_to_raster [-h] [-n RES_NAME] [-p PARAM_FILES] [-f FOLDER] [--fmt {tif,tiff,txt,asc,ascii}] model
```

With both commands you can use the `-h` option do print help.

## Models references <a name="models-refs"></a>

We provide here a basic descriptions of models compatible with `tilupy`. The list of references is not exhaustive. 

### Shaltop <a name="ref-shaltop"></a>

`shaltop` models gravitational flow models over general topographies with small slope variation (small curvature) and friction. The equations are expressed in a horizontal/vertical reference frame and the shallow approximation is imposed in the direction normal to the slope. `shaltop` is not yet freely available.
