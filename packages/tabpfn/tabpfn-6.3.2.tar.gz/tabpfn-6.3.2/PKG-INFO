              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           ---------------------- ADDITIONAL PROVISION --------------------------
        
            10. Additional attribution.
            If You distribute or make available the Work or any Derivative
            Work thereof relating to any part of the source or model weights,
            or a product or service (including another AI model) that contains
            any source or model weights, You shall (A) provide a copy of this
            License with any such materials; and (B) prominently display
            “Built with PriorLabs-TabPFN” on each related website, user interface, blogpost,

            weights or model outputs to create, train, fine tune, distil, or
            otherwise improve an AI model, which is distributed or made available,
            you shall also include “TabPFN” at the beginning of any such AI model name.
            To clarify, internal benchmarking and testing without external
            communication shall not qualify as distribution or making available
            pursuant to this Section 10 and no attribution under this Section 10
            shall be required.

## Quick Start

### Interactive Notebook Tutorial
> [!TIP]
>
> Dive right in with our interactive Colab notebook! It's the best way to get a hands-on feel for TabPFN, walking you through installation, classification, and regression examples.
>
> [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/PriorLabs/TabPFN/blob/main/examples/notebooks/TabPFN_Demo_Local.ipynb)

> ⚡ **GPU Recommended**:
> For optimal performance, use a GPU (even older ones with ~8GB VRAM work well; 16GB needed for some large datasets).
> On CPU, only small datasets (≲1000 samples) are feasible.
> No GPU? Use our free hosted inference via [TabPFN Client](https://github.com/PriorLabs/tabpfn-client).

### Installation
Official installation (pip)
```bash
pip install tabpfn
```
OR installation from source
```bash
pip install "tabpfn @ git+https://github.com/PriorLabs/TabPFN.git"
```
OR local development installation: First [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation), which we use for development, then run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PriorLabs/TabPFN.git --depth 1
cd TabPFN
uv sync
```

### Basic Usage

#### Classification
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, roc_auc_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from tabpfn import TabPFNClassifier
from tabpfn.constants import ModelVersion

# Load data
X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

# Initialize a classifier
clf = TabPFNClassifier()  # Uses TabPFN 2.5 weights, finetuned on real data.
# To use TabPFN v2:
# clf = TabPFNClassifier.create_default_for_version(ModelVersion.V2)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)


# Predict probabilities
prediction_probabilities = clf.predict_proba(X_test)
print("ROC AUC:", roc_auc_score(y_test, prediction_probabilities[:, 1]))

# Predict labels
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy", accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
```

#### Regression
```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from tabpfn import TabPFNRegressor
from tabpfn.constants import ModelVersion

# Load Boston Housing data
df = fetch_openml(data_id=531, as_frame=True)  # Boston Housing dataset
X = df.data
y = df.target.astype(float)  # Ensure target is float for regression

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.5, random_state=42)

# Initialize the regressor
regressor = TabPFNRegressor()  # Uses TabPFN-2.5 weights, trained on synthetic data only.
# To use TabPFN v2:
# regressor = TabPFNRegressor.create_default_for_version(ModelVersion.V2)
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
predictions = regressor.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, predictions)

print("Mean Squared Error (MSE):", mse)
print("R² Score:", r2)
```

## ❓ FAQ

### **Usage & Compatibility**

**Q: What dataset sizes work best with TabPFN?**
A: TabPFN-2.5 is optimized for **datasets up to 50,000 rows**. For larger datasets, consider using **Random Forest preprocessing** or other extensions. See our [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/154SoIzNW1LHBWyrxNwmBqtFAr1uZRZ6a#scrollTo=OwaXfEIWlhC8) for strategies.

**Q: Why can't I use TabPFN with Python 3.8?**
A: TabPFN requires **Python 3.9+** due to newer language features. Compatible versions: **3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13**.

### **Installation & Setup**

**Q: How do I get access to TabPFN-2.5?**

Visit [https://huggingface.co/Prior-Labs/tabpfn_2_5](https://huggingface.co/Prior-Labs/tabpfn_2_5) and accept the license terms. If access via huggingface is not an option for you, please contact us at [`sales@priorlabs.ai`](mailto:sales@priorlabs.ai).

Downloading the model requires your machine to be logged into Hugging Face. To do so, run `hf auth login` in your terminal, see the [huggingface documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/quick-start#authentication) for details..

**Q: How do I use TabPFN without an internet connection?**

TabPFN automatically downloads model weights when first used. For offline usage:

**Using the Provided Download Script**

If you have the TabPFN repository, you can use the included script to download all models (including ensemble variants):

```bash
# After installing TabPFN
python scripts/download_all_models.py
```

This script will download the main classifier and regressor models, as well as all ensemble variant models to your system's default cache directory.

**Manual Download**

1. Download the model files manually from HuggingFace:
   - Classifier: [tabpfn-v2.5-classifier-v2.5_default.ckpt](https://huggingface.co/Prior-Labs/tabpfn_2_5/blob/main/tabpfn-v2.5-classifier-v2.5_default.ckpt) (Note: the classifier default uses the model fine-tuned on real data).
   - Regressor: [tabpfn-v2.5-regressor-v2.5_default.ckpt](https://huggingface.co/Prior-Labs/tabpfn_2_5/blob/main/tabpfn-v2.5-regressor-v2.5_default.ckpt)

2. Place the file in one of these locations:
   - Specify directly: `TabPFNClassifier(model_path="/path/to/model.ckpt")`
   - Set environment variable: `export TABPFN_MODEL_CACHE_DIR="/path/to/dir"` (see environment variables FAQ below)
   - Default OS cache directory:
     - Windows: `%APPDATA%\tabpfn\`
     - macOS: `~/Library/Caches/tabpfn/`
     - Linux: `~/.cache/tabpfn/`

**Q: I'm getting a `pickle` error when loading the model. What should I do?**
A: Try the following:
- Download the newest version of tabpfn `pip install tabpfn --upgrade`
- Ensure model files downloaded correctly (re-download if needed)

**Q: What environment variables can I use to configure TabPFN?**
A: TabPFN uses Pydantic settings for configuration, supporting environment variables and `.env` files:

**Model Configuration:**
- `TABPFN_MODEL_CACHE_DIR`: Custom directory for caching downloaded TabPFN models (default: platform-specific user cache directory)
- `TABPFN_ALLOW_CPU_LARGE_DATASET`: Allow running TabPFN on CPU with large datasets (>1000 samples). Set to `true` to override the CPU limitation. Note: This will be very slow!

**PyTorch Settings:**
- `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF`: PyTorch CUDA memory allocation configuration to optimize GPU memory usage (default: `max_split_size_mb:512`). See [PyTorch CUDA documentation](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html#optimizing-memory-usage-with-pytorch-cuda-alloc-conf) for more information.

Example:
```bash
export TABPFN_MODEL_CACHE_DIR="/path/to/models"
export TABPFN_ALLOW_CPU_LARGE_DATASET=true
export PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF="max_split_size_mb:512"
```

Or simply set them in your `.env`

**Q: How do I save and load a trained TabPFN model?**
A: Use :func:`save_fitted_tabpfn_model` to persist a fitted estimator and reload
it later with :func:`load_fitted_tabpfn_model` (or the corresponding
``load_from_fit_state`` class methods).

```python
from tabpfn import TabPFNRegressor
from tabpfn.model_loading import (
    load_fitted_tabpfn_model,
    save_fitted_tabpfn_model,
)

# Train the regressor on GPU
reg = TabPFNRegressor(device="cuda")
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)
save_fitted_tabpfn_model(reg, "my_reg.tabpfn_fit")

# Later or on a CPU-only machine
reg_cpu = load_fitted_tabpfn_model("my_reg.tabpfn_fit", device="cpu")
```

To store just the foundation model weights (without a fitted estimator) use
``save_tabpfn_model(reg.model_, "my_tabpfn.ckpt")``. This merely saves a
checkpoint of the pre-trained weights so you can later create and fit a fresh
estimator. Reload the checkpoint with ``load_model_criterion_config``.

### **Performance & Limitations**

**Q: Can TabPFN handle missing values?**
A: **Yes!**

**Q: How can I improve TabPFN’s performance?**
A: Best practices:
- Use **AutoTabPFNClassifier** from [TabPFN Extensions](https://github.com/priorlabs/tabpfn-extensions) for post-hoc ensembling
- Feature engineering: Add domain-specific features to improve model performance

Not effective:
- Adapt feature scaling
- Convert categorical features to numerical values (e.g., one-hot encoding)

**Q: What are the different checkpoints on [Hugging-Face](https://huggingface.co/Prior-Labs/tabpfn_2_5/tree/main)?**
A: Beyond the default checkpoints, the other available checkpoints are experimental and worse on average, and we recommend to always start with the defaults. They can be used as part of an ensembling or hyperparameter optimization system (and are used automatically in `AutoTabPFNClassifier`) or tried out manually. Their name suffixes refer to what we expect them to be good at.

<details>
<summary>More detail on each TabPFN-2.5 checkpoint</summary>

We add the 🌍 emoji for checkpoints finetuned on real datasets. See the [TabPFN-2.5 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08667) for the list of 43 datasets.

- `tabpfn-v2.5-classifier-v2.5_default.ckpt` 🌍: default classification checkpoint, finetuned on real-data.
- `tabpfn-v2.5-classifier-v2.5_default-2.ckpt`: best classification synthetic checkpoint. Use this to get the default TabPFN-2.5 classification model without real-data finetuning.
- `tabpfn-v2.5-classifier-v2.5_large-features-L.ckpt`: specialized for larger features (up to 500) and small samples (< 5K).
- `tabpfn-v2.5-classifier-v2.5_large-features-XL.ckpt`: specialized for larger features (up to  1000, could support `max_features_per_estimator=1000`).
- `tabpfn-v2.5-classifier-v2.5_large-samples.ckpt`: specialized for larger sample sizes (larger than 30K)
- `tabpfn-v2.5-classifier-v2.5_real.ckpt` 🌍: other real-data finetuned classification checkpoint. Pretty good overall but bad on large features (>100-200).
- `tabpfn-v2.5-classifier-v2.5_real-large-features.ckpt` 🌍: other real-data finetuned classification checkpoint, worse on large samples (> 10K)
- `tabpfn-v2.5-classifier-v2.5_real-large-samples-and-features.ckpt` 🌍: identical to `tabpfn-v2.5-classifier-v2.5_default.ckpt`
- `tabpfn-v2.5-classifier-v2.5_variant.ckpt`: pretty good but bad on large features (> 100-200).
- `tabpfn-v2.5-regressor-v2.5_default.ckpt`: default regression checkpoint, trained on synthetic data only.
- `tabpfn-v2.5-regressor-v2.5_low-skew.ckpt`: variant specialized at low target skew data (but quite bad on average).
- `tabpfn-v2.5-regressor-v2.5_quantiles.ckpt`: variant which might be interesting for quantile / distribution estimation, though the default should still be prioritized for this.
- `tabpfn-v2.5-regressor-v2.5_real.ckpt` 🌍: finetuned on real-data. Best checkpoint among the checkpoints finetuned on real data. For regression we recommend the synthetic-only checkpoint as a default, but this checkpoint is quite a bit better on some datasets.
- `tabpfn-v2.5-regressor-v2.5_real-variant.ckpt` 🌍: other regression variant finetuned on real data.
- `tabpfn-v2.5-regressor-v2.5_small-samples.ckpt`: variant slightly better on small (< 3K) samples.
- `tabpfn-v2.5-regressor-v2.5_variant.ckpt`: other variant, no clear specialty but can be better on a few datasets.
