        "Backlighting, medium shot, sunset, soft light, silhouette, central composition, circular camera movement. The camera follows the character from behind to the front, showing a rugged cowboy gripping his holster tightly, his eyes alert as he patrols the desolate Western ghost town. The cowboy wears a worn brown leather jacket, with a bullet belt around his waist and the brim of his hat pulled low. His outline is sketched into a soft silhouette by the setting sun. Behind him are dilapidated wooden buildings with long-broken windows, glass shards scattered on the ground, and dust swirling in the wind. The camera slowly circles from his back to his front, with light pouring from behind, creating a strong dramatic contrast. The scene presents warm tones, enhancing the desolate atmosphere.",
