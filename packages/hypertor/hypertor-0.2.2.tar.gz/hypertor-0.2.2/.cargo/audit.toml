    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: rsa crate - Marvin Attack timing side-channel
    # This is a transitive dependency from arti-client (tor-llcrypto -> rsa)
    # No fix available upstream yet. The Tor Project is aware and tracking this.
    # Risk: Medium severity (5.9), but requires significant resources to exploit
    # and arti uses RSA only for legacy Tor protocol compatibility.
