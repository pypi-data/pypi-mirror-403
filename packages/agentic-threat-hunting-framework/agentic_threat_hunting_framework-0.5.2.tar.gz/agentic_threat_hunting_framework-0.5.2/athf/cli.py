  # Initialize a new hunting workspace
  athf init

  # Create your first hunt
  athf hunt new

  # Search for credential dumping hunts
  athf hunt search "credential dumping"

  # List all completed hunts
  athf hunt list --status completed

Getting Started:
  1. Run 'athf init' to set up your workspace
  2. Run 'athf hunt new' to create your first hunt
  3. Document using the LOCK pattern (Learn → Observe → Check → Keep)
  4. Track findings and iterate
