Contributions are welcome! Please check the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XTpc6Fa9eB) or open an issue to discuss planned features.

## Development

This project uses `uv` for dependency management and workflow.

```bash
uv sync --all-packages
uv run vsview
```

If you are in an environment where you cannot compile C extensions,
remove `"src/vspackrgb"` from `members` and comment out the `vspackrgb = { workspace = true }` line
in `pyproject.toml` before running `uv sync` to use the pre-compiled version from PyPI.
