Rendering calibration images
---------------------------------------------

This example takes you through how to render calibration images for a given DIC
setup using in-built tools for calibration target generation.

Note that this example produces a significant number of images and will take a 
long time to run.

# Firstly, a save path must be set.
# In order to do this a base path must be set. Then all the generated files will
# be saved to a subfolder within this specified base directory
# (e.g. blenderimages).
# If no base directory is specified, it will be set as your home directory.

# %%
# Creating the scene
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# In order to create a DIC setup in Blender, first a scene must be created.
# A scene is initialised using the `BlenderScene` class. All the subsequent
# objects and actions necessary are then methods of this class.
scene = blender.Scene()

# %%
# The next thing to add to the scene is the calibration target.
# This is done by specifing the size of calibration target to add to the scene
# by passing in an array of (width, height, depth).
# The calibration target being simulated here is 12 x 9 with 10 mm spacing.

target = scene.add_cal_target(target_size=np.array([150, 100, 10]))

# %%
# The cameras can then be initialised. A stereo camera system is defined by a
# `CameraStereo` object, which contains the intrinsic parameters of both cameras
# as well as the extrinsic parameters between them.
# There are two ways to initialise a `CameraStereo` object.
# One way is to specify the camera parameters separately for each camera, create
# a `CameraStereo` object, and then add the stereo system using the
# `add_stereo_system` method.
# The other method is to use a convenience function, as shown below.
# This requires you to first initialise one camera. Then you can choose between
# either a face-on or symmetric stereo system. Then, either of the
# `symmetric_stereo_cameras` or `faceon_stereo_cameras` functions can be used to
# initialise a `CameraStereo` object. The only input required to these functions
# are the camera parameters for the first camera, and the desired stereo angle
# between the two. The cameras can then be added to the Blender scene using the
# `add_stereo_system` method.

# %%
# Since this scene contains a stereo DIC system, a calibration file will be
# required to run the images through a DIC engine.
# A calibration file can be generated directly from the `CameraStereo` object.
# The calibration file will be saved in `YAML` format. However, if you wish to
# use MatchID to process the images, `save_calibration_mid` can be used instead
# to save the calibration in a format readable by MatchID.
# The calibration file will be saved to a sub-directory of the base directory
# called "calibration".
# This calibration file with "perfect" parameters can be used as a comparitive
# benchmark to the calibration gained from running the calibration files through
# a DIC engine.
