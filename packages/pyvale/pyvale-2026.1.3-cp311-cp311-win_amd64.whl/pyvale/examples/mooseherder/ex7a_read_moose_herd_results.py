"""
Reading exodus output from a parameter sweep
================================================================================

In this example we run a parallel sweep of a moose simulation and then read the
results of the whole sweep using the sweep reader class.

**Installing moose**: To run this example you will need to have installed moose
on your system. As moose supports unix operating systems windows users will need
to use windows subsystem for linux (WSL). We use the proteus moose build which
can be found here: https://github.com/aurora-multiphysics/proteus. Build scripts
for common linux distributions can be found in the 'scripts' directory of the
repo. You can also create your own moose build using instructions here:
https://mooseframework.inl.gov/.

We start by importing what we need for this example.

# read sequential functions and if the simulation output files are small it is
