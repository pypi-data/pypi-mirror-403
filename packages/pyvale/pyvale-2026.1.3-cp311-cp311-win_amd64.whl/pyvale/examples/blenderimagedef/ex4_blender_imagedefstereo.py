"""
Deforming a sample for stereo DIC
===================================================

This example takes you through creating stereo DIC scene, applying deformation
to the sample, and rendering images at each deformation timestep.

Test case: mechanical analysis of a plate with a hole loaded in tension.

# Creating the scene
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

# A scene is initialised using the `BlenderScene` class. All the subsequent
# objects and actions necessary are then methods of this class.
scene = blender.Scene()

# %%
# The next thing that can be added to the scene is a sample.
# This is done by passing in the `RenderMeshData` object.
# It should be noted that the mesh will be centred on the origin to allow for
# the cameras to be centred on the mesh.
# Once the part is added to the Blender scene, it can be both moved and rotated.

part = scene.add_part(render_mesh, sim_spat_dim=3)
# Set the part location
part_location = np.array([0, 0, 0])

# Set part rotation
part_rotation = Rotation.from_euler("xyz", [0, 0, 0], degrees=True)
blender.Tools.rotate_blender_obj(part=part, rot_world=part_rotation)

# %%
# The cameras can then be initialised. A stereo camera system is defined by a
# `CameraStereo` object, which contains the intrinsic parameters of both cameras
# as well as the extrinsic parameters between them.
# There are two ways to initialise a `CameraStereo` object.
# One way is to specify the camera parameters separately for each camera, create
# a `CameraStereo` object, and then add the stereo system using the
# `add_stereo_system` method.
# The other method is to use a convenience function, as shown below.
# This requires you to first initialise one camera. Then you can choose between
# either a face-on or symmetric stereo system. Then, either of the
# `symmetric_stereo_cameras` or `faceon_stereo_cameras` functions can be used to
# initialise a `CameraStereo` object. The only input required to these functions
# are the camera parameters for the first camera, and the desired stereo angle
# between the two. The cameras can then be added to the Blender scene using the
# `add_stereo_system` method.

# will all be defaulted if no inputs are provided.

# with the pattern.

# This will automatically deform the sample, and render images from each camera
# at each deformation timestep.
# If `stage_image` is set to True, the image will be saved to disk, converted to
