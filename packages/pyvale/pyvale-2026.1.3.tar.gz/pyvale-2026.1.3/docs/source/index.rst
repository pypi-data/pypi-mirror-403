Pyvale: The Python Validation Engine
====================================
Pyvale is your virtual engineering laboratory: An all-in-one package for sensor uncertainty quantification simulation, experimental design, sensor placement optimisation  and simulation calibration/validation.
Used to simulate experimental data from an input multi-physics simulation by explicitly modelling sensors with realistic uncertainties.
Useful for experimental data analysis (especially for imaging sensors such as digital image correlation and infra-red thermography), experimental design, sensor placement optimisation, testing simulation validation metrics and virtually testing digital shadows/twins.
