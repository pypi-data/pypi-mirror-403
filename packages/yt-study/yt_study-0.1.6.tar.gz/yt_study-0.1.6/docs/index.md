# Introduction

**yt-study** turns video content into readable, searchable knowledge.

In the age of video learning, "ctrl+f" doesn't work. Finding a specific configuration line mentioned 4 hours into a 10-hour tutorial is frustrating. Watching a video at 2x speed is still slow compared to reading.

`yt-study` solves this by converting the audio track of any YouTube video into high-quality, structured Markdown notes.

## The Problem

-   **Video is linear**: You can't skim a video like you can a blog post.
-   **Information is locked**: Code snippets, definitions, and commands are trapped in pixels.
-   **Context is lost**: Short summaries miss the "why" and "how".

## The Solution

`yt-study` acts as an automated research assistant. It:

1.  **Listens** to the video (via transcripts).
2.  **Understands** the structure (via chapters).
3.  **Synthesizes** the information using LLMs.
4.  **Preserves** the technical details you actually need.

## Use Cases

-   **Students**: Turn a semester's worth of recorded lectures into a study guide.
-   **Developers**: Extract code blocks and config steps from technical tutorials.
-   **Researchers**: Summarize long-form interviews or documentaries.
-   **Non-Native Speakers**: Consume content in your preferred language instantly.
