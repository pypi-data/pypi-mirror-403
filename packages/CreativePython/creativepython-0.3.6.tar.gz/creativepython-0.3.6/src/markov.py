#
# Creates a markov model (of arbitrary order).  Order is specified at object construction time.
#
# Some Definitions:
#
# First-order (order = 1) means symbol to symbol transition, i.e., bigram probabiities.
# Second-order (order = 2) means pair-symbols to symbol transition, i.e., trigram probabilities.
#
# Two main functions:
#
#    learn(sequence) - extracts n-grams from the list of symbols and updates the model accordingly.
#
#    generate(startSequence) - synthesize a phrase of events, given a starting sequence, using transition
#                              probabilities found in the model.

#################################################################################################################
#
# REVISIONS:
# 1.6   26-Aug-2025 (tr)   Brought markov into CreativePython. Add CompositeMarkoveModel class.
#                          Updated dictionary iterations and key views to be python3 compatible.
#
# 1.5   18-Sep-2024 (tr)   Removed self.startSequence. In the past, if no startSequence was provided to
#                          generate(),it would use the original first sequence encountered during learning.
#                          Now, if no startSequence is provided, generate() randomly picks a key from self.model
#                          to start with. Removed analyzeCopeEvents() since it is no longer needed.
#
# 1.4   03-Aug-2022 (bm)   Changed function analyze() to learn() - more meaningful / appropriate.
#                          Also, added default option for startSymbol in generate(), since that's usually the
#                          first symbol in the learning corpus.
#
# Earlier notes:
#
# 1.  Quick and dirty version replaced with a much more memory-efficient version.  Maintains a list of
#     the number of occurrences of each symbol, rather than a list of (possibly duplicate) symbols
#
#     Data Structure summarized below:
#
#     model = { tupleOfSymbols: [ transitionDictionary, totalCount] }
#     transitionDictionary = { transitionSymbol: occuranceCount }
#     totalCount = sum(occuranceCounts)
#
# 2.  Although we support arbitrarily large Markov orders, anything more than 2-3 is perhaps unnecessary for most
#     musical applications.  If a large order is used, the model simply memorizes the piece, as there isn't
#     much variety (alternatives) following a large 'key' (sequence of symbols).
#
# Code adopted from http://code.activestate.com/recipes/194364-the-markov-chain-algorithm/

##### Composite Markov Model ##########################################################
#
# A composite Markov model is a collection of Markov models of different orders.
# It enhances Markov chain generation by combining the situational benefits of these different orders.
# First-order (order = 1) means symbol-to-symbol transition, i.e., bigram probabilities.
# Second-order (order = 2) means pair-of-symbols-to-symbol transition, i.e., trigram probabilities.
# And so on...
#
# The retrieval mechanism in a composite Markov model plays a crucial role in transition selection during Markov chain generations.
# When adding to a new Markov chain, the model determines the appropriate transition based on its current state and learned data.
# However, higher-order sequences, which capture complex relationships, may not always be available, especially with limited
# historical data or in unfamiliar contexts. To address this limitation, the retrieval mechanism allows the composite Markov model
# to fall back on lower order models to find a transition. It prioritizes higher-order contexts, but gracefully falls back to lower-orders
# if needed, starting a generation even with limited context. In this way, a Markov chain may be built up to eventually work with
# the maximum order model. By prioritizing informed, context-specific transitions while having a fallback options,
# a composite Markov model can produce coherent Markov chains across a range of starting contexts.

class CompositeMarkovModel():

   def __init__(self, maxOrder):
      """
