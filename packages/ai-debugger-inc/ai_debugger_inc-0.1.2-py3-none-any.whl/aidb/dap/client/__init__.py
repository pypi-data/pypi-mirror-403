"""New DAP client with clean architecture.

This package provides a redesigned DAP client that fixes the architectural
issues in the original implementation:

- No circular dependencies
- Event handlers never send requests
- Single request path through client.send_request()
- Proper thread safety and request serialization
- Clean separation of concerns

The main entry points are:
- DAPClient: Low-level client for direct DAP protocol access
- SessionState: Shared state tracking
- EventProcessor: Event handling without request sending
