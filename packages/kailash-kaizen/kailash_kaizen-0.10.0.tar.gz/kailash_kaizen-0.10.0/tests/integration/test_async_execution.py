"""
Tier 2 Integration Tests: Async Execution with Real Infrastructure.

Tests verify AsyncSingleShotStrategy uses true async execution (AsyncLocalRuntime),
not sync LocalRuntime with thread pool wrapper.

CRITICAL ISSUE BEING TESTED:
- AsyncSingleShotStrategy.execute() currently uses LocalRuntime with loop.run_in_executor()
- This defeats the purpose of async - it's just thread pool wrapping
- Expected: Should use AsyncLocalRuntime for true async execution

Test Coverage:
1. Verify AsyncLocalRuntime is used (not LocalRuntime)
2. Verify concurrent execution achieves true parallelism
3. Verify no thread pool exhaustion with 100+ requests
4. Verify true non-blocking I/O
5. Verify fallback path uses AsyncOpenAI correctly
6. Verify strategy detection works correctly

Total: 6 integration tests

Expected Results:
- ALL TESTS SHOULD FAIL INITIALLY (before fix)
- After fix, all tests should PASS
- Tests clearly show what needs to be fixed

NO MOCKING - All tests use real infrastructure (OpenAI API)
