Replay Protection - Prevent message replay attacks.

This module provides replay protection to detect and prevent
the reuse of previously seen messages (replay attacks).

Key Components:
- ReplayProtection: Abstract interface
- InMemoryReplayProtection: In-memory implementation for development
- Future: RedisReplayProtection for distributed production use

    Abstract interface for replay protection.

    Replay protection detects attempts to reuse previously seen
    messages by tracking message nonces. Once a nonce is recorded,
    any future message with the same nonce is rejected as a replay.

    Implementations should:
    - Track nonces with their timestamps
    - Automatically expire old nonces
    - Be thread-safe for concurrent checks
    - Scale appropriately (in-memory vs distributed)

    In-memory replay protection for development and testing.

    This implementation stores nonces in a dictionary and is
    suitable for single-process deployments. For production
    multi-process deployments, use RedisReplayProtection.

    Features:
    - Fast (< 1ms operations)
    - Thread-safe with asyncio.Lock
    - Automatic cleanup support
    - Nonce counting for diagnostics

    Limitations:
    - Not distributed (single process only)
    - Memory-limited (requires cleanup)
    - Lost on process restart

    Example:
        >>> protection = InMemoryReplayProtection()
        >>> nonce = secrets.token_hex(32)
        >>> # First check - should pass
        >>> is_new = await protection.check_nonce("msg-1", nonce, datetime.now(timezone.utc))
        >>> assert is_new is True
        >>> # Second check - should fail (replay)
