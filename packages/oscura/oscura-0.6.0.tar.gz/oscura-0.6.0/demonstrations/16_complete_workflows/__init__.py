"""Complete end-to-end workflow demonstrations.

This package demonstrates complete real-world workflows from start to finish,
including report generation and traceability.

Demonstrations:
- 01_unknown_device_re.py: Unknown device reverse engineering (capture → dissector)
- 02_automotive_diagnostics.py: Automotive diagnostics (CAN → DTC report)
- 03_emc_testing.py: EMC compliance testing (emissions → compliance report)
- 04_production_testing.py: Production test automation (DUT → pass/fail report)
- 05_failure_analysis.py: Failure investigation (faulty signal → root cause report)
- 06_device_characterization.py: Device characterization (sweep → datasheet validation)

All workflows include:
- Complete end-to-end execution
- Timing measurements
- Report generation
- Validation against requirements
