# SHRECC

Simple Hourly Resolution Electricity Consumption Calculation

## Description

SHRECC package is a python package directly compatible with Brightway2 or Brightway2.5 to create time-aware electricity databases. For any given year and countries (check availability on https://api.energy-charts.info/), download and prepare data for low-voltage electricity consumption.

## Features

- **High-resolution electricity mixes** – Generates electricity life cycle inventories (LCIs) with **hourly** resolution, enhancing accuracy for life cycle assessment (LCA).
- **Brightway2/2.5 compatibility** – Seamlessly integrates with Brightway, allowing direct use in existing LCA models.
- **Dynamic temporal representation** – Users can select electricity mixes by **hour, month, or season**, addressing fluctuations in renewable energy generation and consumption.
- **Automated data retrieval** – Pulls electricity production, trade, and consumption data from the **Energy Charts API**, ensuring up-to-date datasets.
- **Ecoinvent matching** – Aligns with **ecoinvent classifications**, converting from ENTSO-E datasets.
- **User-controlled updates** – Enables **one-time or recurring** updates, allowing continuous tracking of electricity mix evolution over time.
- **Optimized impact assessments** – Helps reduce uncertainty and improve **decision-making for electricity-intensive technologies** by considering real-time electricity mix variations.
