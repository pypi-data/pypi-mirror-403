## Branch flow (required)
- Contributors work on `dev`.
- Maintainers merge `dev` -> `pre-release` via PR.
- Maintainers merge `pre-release` -> `main` via PR.

## X posting (required for merges into main)
This repo posts to X automatically when `main` is updated.

Before any change is merged into `main` (i.e. when preparing the PR `pre-release` -> `main`):
- Read `.github/x-personality.md`
- Write ONE tweet (<= 280 chars) into `.github/next_tweet.txt`
- The tweet should describe the user-visible impact of the changes (not a diff, not raw logs)
- If the change is not tweet-worthy, leave `.github/next_tweet.txt` unchanged (it will skip posting)

Important:
- Do NOT include X credentials anywhere in the repo.
- Do NOT modify `.github/workflows/x-post.yml` unless explicitly asked.
