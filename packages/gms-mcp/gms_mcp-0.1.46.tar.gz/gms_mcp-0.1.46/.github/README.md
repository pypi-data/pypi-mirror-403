# GitHub Actions & Automation

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows and automation scripts for gms-mcp.

## Tweet Automation

The `@gms_mcp` Twitter account is automated using Claude API to generate tweets 3x daily.

### How It Works

1. **Scheduled workflow** (`workflows/x-scheduled-post.yml`) runs at 8am, 2pm, 8pm UTC
2. **Tweet generation** (`scripts/generate_tweet.py`) calls Claude API with context
3. **Posting** (`scripts/post_tweet.py`) posts to X via API
4. **History tracking** persists across runs via GitHub Actions cache

### History Persistence

**Why we use cache instead of committing history:**

The `main` branch is protected and cannot be pushed to from GitHub Actions workflows. We use `actions/cache` with a static key (`tweet-history-v1`) to persist tweet history between runs.

Key points:
- Static cache key ensures the same entry is overwritten each run
- Cache is accessed 3x/day, so it won't expire (7-day limit is for non-accessed caches)
- History includes: posted tweets, topic/format/angle coverage tracking

**If history resets unexpectedly:**
1. Check if the workflow has been paused for >7 days (cache may have expired)
2. The system will reinitialize with empty coverage and rebuild naturally
3. For manual intervention, you can seed a `tweet_history.json` file in the workflow

### Content Diversity System

To prevent repetitive tweets, the system tracks and rotates:

1. **Topics** (14 categories): Code Intelligence, Asset Creation, Maintenance, etc.
2. **Formats** (6 styles): Problem/Solution, Scenario, Comparison, Tip, Q&A, Workflow Story
3. **Angles** (6+ per topic): Different perspectives on each topic
4. **Opening patterns** (7 types): Statement, Scenario, Discovery, Comparison, Question, Workflow, Tip

Each dimension is tracked independently with timestamps, ensuring the least-recently-used option is selected.

### Validation

Generated tweets are validated for:
- Length (50-280 characters)
- Hashtag count (max 3)
- Bad patterns (corporate speak, emoji spam, negative GameMaker framing)
- Exact duplicates (hash comparison)
- Semantic duplicates (>60% word overlap with recent tweets)
- Overused opening patterns
