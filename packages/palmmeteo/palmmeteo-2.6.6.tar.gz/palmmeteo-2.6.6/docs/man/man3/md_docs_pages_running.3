md_docs_pages_running \- Running PALM-meteo 
When PALM-meteo is installed using Method 2 or Method 3, the main running script \fCpmeteo\fP is created in the installation directory\&. This script is executed as 
.PP
.nf
\&./pmeteo {OPTIONS}

.fi
.PP
 When using Method 1 or Method 2, this command is also added to the system's \fCPATH\fP variable, which means that PALM-meteo can be also run as 
.PP
.nf
pmeteo {OPTIONS}

.fi
.PP
 as long as the virtual environment (if used) is enabled\&.
.PP
Finally, as a backup option if neither of the scripts is installed, the \fCpalmmeteo\fP Python module can be executed using 
.PP
.nf
python3 -m palmmeteo {OPTIONS}

.fi
.PP
 Here is the complete list of command line options:

usage: pmeteo [-h] -c CONFIG [CONFIG ...] [-f STAGE] [-t STAGE]
              [-w STAGE [STAGE ...]] [--version] [-v | -s]

PALM-meteo: processor of meteorological input data for the PALM model system.
Creates PALM dynamic driver from various sources.

.SH "Running a subset of workflow stages"
.PP
You may run a selected subset of stages from the full workflow, either using the configuration file, or using the command line options above\&.
.PP
To generate the PALM dynamic driver, all stages of the workflow need to be executed sequentially, which is the default\&. PALM-meteo also fully supports stopping the execution after any stage and restarting it from the next stage later (even on a different machine, if you transfer the intermediate and snapshot files, which are placed in the \fCMETEO\fP directory by default)\&.
.PP
If the execution of any stage crashes for some reason (e\&.g\&. power loss, insufficient disk space, bug in the code for which you have a fix), you may also restart it safely\&. It is also fully supported to restart from any stage which was already performed, unless the snapshot from the previous stage was deleted (configuration option \fCintermediate_files:delete_after_success\fP, off by default)\&.
.PP
Advanced users may also attempt other usage patterns, such as restarting from a later stage after changing the configuration\&. However, the success of this approach depends on the support by the involved plugins\&. If the configuration has been changed, it is advisable to include the first stage \fCcheck_config\fP and potentially also the second stage \fCsetup_model\fP at the beginning\&. The remaining stages should always form a continuous string because the main model data can only be transferred between adjacent stages\&.
