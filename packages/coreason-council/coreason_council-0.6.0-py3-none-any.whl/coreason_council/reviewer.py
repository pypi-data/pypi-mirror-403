    # Example usage of policy engine
    # We might have a mapping of plan types or just run specific policies based on context.
    # For this task, let's assume if it fails the medical policy we reject?
    # Or is the medical policy just an example?
    # The prompt says "Upgrade Policy Engine ... Example: Create a policy ...".
    # It doesn't explicitly say to CALL it in review_plan for ALL plans, but it implies integration.
    # Let's assume if the plan is related to medical advice?
    # Or maybe we just run it as a demonstration.
    # I'll check if the plan description or title suggests medical context, or just run it generally?
    # "Tiered Permissions. Update policy functions to accept user_context."

    # If I just enforce "If it's medical, check medical", how do I know it's medical?
    # I'll assume for now that if the policy function returns False, it MIGHT be a rejection
    # if the plan was supposed to satisfy it.
    # But `require_medical_director_approval` returns True if authorized.
    # Does every plan require medical director approval? Probably not.
    # I will stick to the mandatory "High Risk" check which was explicitly detailed for `review_plan`.
    # The prompt says "review_plan ... Logic: ... Role Check ... Audit ...".
    # The Policy Engine part seems to be about upgrading the *capability* of policies.
    # However, to be thorough, I should probably use the policy.
    # Let's say if the plan requires medical approval (maybe a flag in Plan? or just assumed for now?)
    # I'll stick to the explicit "High Risk" check for now as the primary logic.
