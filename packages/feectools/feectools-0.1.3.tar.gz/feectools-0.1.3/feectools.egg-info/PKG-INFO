# Welcome!

This is a fork of [Psydac](https://github.com/pyccel/psydac) that provides Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) for [Struphy](https://github.com/struphy-hub/struphy). It is a stripped-down version of the original repo with less functionality and fewer dependencies.

The latest version can be installed with
```
pip install -U feectools
```
See the [Struphy documentation](https://struphy-hub.github.io/struphy/index.html) for details on how to use.
