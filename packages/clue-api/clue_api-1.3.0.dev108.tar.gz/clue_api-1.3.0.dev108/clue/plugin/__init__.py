    """Helper class for creating clue plugins with proper server responses and behaviour.

    Includes a default bulk lookup function that multithreads requests to the resource being queried.

    Attributes:
        alternate_bulk_lookup:
            Provides an alternative implementation for bulk enrichment.

            By default, clue plugins will split bulk enrichments into many parallel threads, allowing the plugin to
            use the same enrich function implemented without the need for complex bulk enrichment responses. However,
            in cases where it is necessary to streamline enrichment of bulk selectors (i.e. making hundreds of SQL
            queries instead of one), this alternate lookup function can be used.
        app:
            The underlying Flask object representing the server recieving and responding to requests from the
            central API.
        app_name:
            The name of this clue plugin. Used to configure the cache and for logging.
        cache:
            The instantiated cache for this clue plugin. Can be used directly to cache and retrieve additional data.
        classification:
            The classification level of selectors this plugin accepts.

            Enrichment requests exceeding this classification level will not be processed by this plugin.
        logger:
            The logging instance used internally.
        supported_types:
            The list of types supported by this plugin for enrichment.
        actions:
            A list of action definitions this plugin supports.
        setup_actions:
            An optional function called when a list of supported actions is asked for.

            Useful for runtime generation of actions - for example, returning a list of valid arguments that changes on
            a per-user basis. Can be used instead of the actions attribute.
        validate_token:
            A user-provided function for validating the authentication token provided from the central API.

            Can be used to ensure the audience matches the expected value, ensuring specific fields are present in the
            JWT, etc.
        enrich:
            The main enrichment function.

            Accepts the type and value of the selector, a list of parameters relevant to the enrichment, and the token
            provided from the central API (assuming authentication is enabled). Returns QueryEntry object(s) denoting
            the enrichments for the given selector.
        run_action:
            The main function for running actions.

            Accepts the selected action definition as well as the ExecuteRequest. If the Action definition's parameters
            were extended with a custom ExecuteRequest (i.e. to add additional user parameters) that instance will be
            passed instead, and casting the argument will be necessary.
        fetchers:
            A list of fetcher definitions this plugin supports.

        run_fetcher:
            The main function for running fetchers.

            Accepts the selected fetcher definition as well as the selector to execute the fetcher on. Returns a
            completed FetcherResult.
        liveness:
            A liveness probe for kubernetes implementations of clue.
        readiness:
