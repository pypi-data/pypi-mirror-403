## Features
The full documentation can be found [here](https://sy-stm.pages.gitlab.dlr.de/software/patme/).

### Software Engineering Features
- software builds
- release automation
- build documentation (sphinx)
- logging

Planned items:
- exception hooks
- (potentially) decorators
- Create RCE components and push them on an RCE server

### Common useful features
Planned items:
- Call FEM software
- Plot samples (Matplotlib, Latex-Pgfplots)

### DLR-SY specific features
Planned items:
- SSH interface
- SSH based cluster interaction
- Run several jobs (FEM, python, matlab etc.) as samples with various parallelization options
    - parallel local
    - parallel remote
    - asynchronous sampling (e.g. dependend on license availability)


software builds, documentation, cluster interaction, calling fem tools, logging, exceptions.



## Installation

At least you require Python 3.

### Installation from source
Get patme source from

> https://gitlab.dlr.de/sy-stm/software/patme.git

and add the /src folder to pythonpath in the environment variables

### Installation as python package
Install it from [the gitlab packacke registry](https://gitlab.dlr.de/sy-stm/software/patme/-/packages)

You can download the latest artifact (*.whl) and install it using


> cd patme
> python setup.py install patme<version>.whl


### Test the installation
In python execute:

> import patme

### Developers

Developers may also install the pre-commit hook.

**Precommit**
1. install the pre-commit
   > pip install pre-commit
2. In the patme folder
   > pre-commit install

This enables the pre-commit hooks defined in _.pre-commit-config.yaml_
and eases your commits and successful pipline runs.


## CI Pipeline and Jobs for Developers

If you encounter any failed job on the pipeline you can run them locally for more information.
(prerequisite: have _make_ and _poetry_ installed [e.g. conda install make poetry])

See all availabe make targets used for the ci-jobs

> make list

Find the target with matching names and execute them locally e.g.:
> make test

If **check-formatting** fails, run the following to fix issues.
> make formatting

If **check-license-metadata** fails, run
> make check-license-metadata

identify the corresponding filename and run the following (include the filename in $filename)
> poetry run reuse addheader --copyright="German Aerospace Center (DLR)" --license="MIT" $filename
