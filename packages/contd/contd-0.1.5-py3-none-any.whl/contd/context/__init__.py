"""
Contd Context - Reasoning preservation for durable workflows.

Provides infrastructure for detecting and preventing context rot
in long-running LLM agent workflows. The engine observes and preserves
reasoning state — it does not interpret or manage LLM interactions.

Three primitives:
- annotate(): Developer-supplied reasoning breadcrumbs (always available)
- ingest(): Accept raw reasoning tokens when the model exposes them
- distill(): Periodic compression of accumulated reasoning via developer-provided function

The engine stores these durably and returns them on restore,
giving the developer raw materials to reconstruct agent context.
