# QFlux - A Quantum Computer Dynamics Package

This repository contains various protocols for performing quantum dynamics simulations with quantum devices. Each submodule contains object implementations for these protocols as demonstrated in a publication, as well as comprehensive tutorial notebooks designed to help users understand, implement and build upon various simulation techniques for studying quantum dynamics using quantum computer frameworks. Each tutorial is provided in Python, using Jupyter Notebooks to offer detailed explanations in both markdown and code comments.

## Getting Started <a name="start"></a>

`qflux` can be installed via `pip`: 

```bash
pip install qflux
```

To get started, one can simply select a notebook and execute them locally or in google collab. Necessary dependencies will be installed using `pip`.

If using uv through the commandline, use the following syntax to create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

The necessary packages, including development, can be installed as follows:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
