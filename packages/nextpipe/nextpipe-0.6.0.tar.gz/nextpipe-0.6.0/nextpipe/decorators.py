"""
Decorators for defining pipeline steps and workflows.

This module provides decorators and helper classes for defining pipeline steps
and their relationships in a workflow. These decorators are used to annotate
functions that represent steps in a pipeline, and to define the order in which
they are executed.

Classes
-------
InputType
    Enumeration of input types for application steps.
StepType
    Enumeration of step types.
Step
    Represents a step in a pipeline.
Needs
    Represents dependencies between steps.
Optional
    Represents an optional step condition.
Repeat
    Represents a repeating step.
Foreach
    Represents a step that fans out its output.
Join
    Represents a step that joins multiple inputs.
App
    Represents an external application step.

Functions
---------
step
    Decorator to mark a function as a step in the pipeline.
needs
    Decorator to mark the predecessors of a step.
optional
    Decorator to mark a step as optional.
repeat
    Decorator to make a step be repeated a number of times.
foreach
    Decorator to perform a "fanout" operation.
join
    Decorator to perform a "join" operation.
app
    Decorator to mark a step as a Nextmv Application.

    Decorator to mark a step as a Nextmv Application (external application)
    step.

    You can import the `app` decorator directly from `nextpipe`:

    ```python
    from nextpipe import app
    ```

    If this decorator is used, an external application will be run, using the
    specified options. You need to have a valid Nextmv account and
    Application before you can use this decorator. Make sure the
    `NEXTMV_API_KEY` environment variable is set as well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    app_id : str
        The ID of the application to run.
    instance_id : str
        The ID of the instance to run. Default is defined by the app on Platform.
    options : dict[str, Any]
        The options to pass to the application. This is a dictionary of
        parameter names and values. The values must be JSON serializable.
    full_result : bool
        Whether to return the full result of the application run. If this is
        set to `True`, the full result (with metadata) will be returned. If
        this is set to `False`, only the output of the application will be
        returned.
    run_configuration : nextmv.RunConfiguration
        The configuration to apply when running the app.
    polling_options : Optional[nextmv.PollingOptions]
        Options for polling for the results of the app run. This is used to
        configure the polling behavior, such as the timeout and backoff
        options. Default (or when undefined) is the predefined options in the
        class itself. Please note that the `.initial_delay` attribute will be
        overridden internally, as a strategy to stagger multiple parallel runs
        and avoid overloading the Platform.

    Example
    -------
    In this example the step `pre_process` is executed first. After
    pre-processing is completed, the result is passed to the `solve` step. This
    step runs a Nextmv Application with the ID `echo`. The result of the
    application run is passed to the final step `post_process`, which
    post-processes the result.
