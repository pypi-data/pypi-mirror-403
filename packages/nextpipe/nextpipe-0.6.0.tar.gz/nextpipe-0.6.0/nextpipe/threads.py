Thread management utilities for parallel job execution.

This module provides classes for managing multithreaded job execution.

Classes

Job
    A callable job that can be submitted to a thread pool.
Pool
    A thread pool for executing jobs in parallel.

The module also provides a thread local storage variable for thread-specific data.

lower value more fit for the respective hardware is recommended when running many

class Job:
    """A callable job that can be submitted to a thread pool.

    This class represents a job that can be executed by a worker thread in a
    thread pool. It wraps a target callable with arguments and callback functions
    that are executed when the job starts and completes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target : Callable
        The function to be executed by the job.
    start_callback : Callable
        Function to be called when the job starts. Takes the job as a parameter.
    done_callback : Callable
        Function to be called when the job completes. Takes the job as a parameter.
    args : Optional[list], optional
        Arguments to be passed to the target function, by default None.
    name : str, optional
        Name for the job, by default None.
    reference : Any, optional
        Reference to any object associated with this job, by default None.

    Attributes
    ----------
    target : Callable
        The function to be executed by the job.
    start_callback : Callable
        Function to be called when the job starts.
    done_callback : Callable
        Function to be called when the job completes.
    args : Optional[list]
        Arguments to be passed to the target function.
    name : str
        Name for the job.
    reference : Any
        Reference to any object associated with this job.
    done : bool
        Whether the job has completed.
    result : Any
        The result of the job execution.
    error : Exception
        Any exception that occurred during job execution.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> def my_task(x, y):
    ...     return x + y
    >>> def on_start(job):
    ...     print(f"Starting job {job.name}")
