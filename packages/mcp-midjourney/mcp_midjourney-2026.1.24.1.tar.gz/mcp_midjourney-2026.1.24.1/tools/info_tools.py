    return """Available Midjourney Actions and Tools:

Image Generation:
- midjourney_imagine: Generate images from a text prompt (creates 2x2 grid)
- midjourney_transform: Transform existing images (upscale, variation, zoom, pan)
- midjourney_blend: Blend multiple images together
- midjourney_with_reference: Generate using a reference image as inspiration

Image Editing:
- midjourney_edit: Edit an existing image with a text prompt
- midjourney_describe: Get AI descriptions of an image (reverse prompt)

Video Generation:
- midjourney_generate_video: Generate video from text and reference image
- midjourney_extend_video: Extend an existing video to make it longer

Translation:
- midjourney_translate: Translate Chinese text to English for prompts

Task Management:
- midjourney_get_task: Check status of a single generation
- midjourney_get_tasks_batch: Check status of multiple generations

Information:
- midjourney_list_actions: Show this action reference (you are here)
- midjourney_get_prompt_guide: Show how to write effective prompts

Workflow Examples:
1. Quick image: midjourney_imagine → midjourney_transform (upscale)
2. Image variations: midjourney_imagine → midjourney_transform (variation)
3. Image fusion: midjourney_blend with multiple image URLs
4. Style transfer: midjourney_with_reference with style prompt
5. Video creation: midjourney_generate_video → midjourney_extend_video

    Shows how to structure prompts and use parameters for best results.
    Following this guide helps Midjourney understand your creative vision.

    Returns:
        Complete guide with prompt structure, parameters, and examples.
    """
    return """Midjourney Prompt Guide:

Prompt Structure:
- Start with the main subject
- Add descriptive details (style, lighting, mood)
- Include artistic references if desired
- Add parameters at the end

Common Parameters:
- --ar X:Y: Aspect ratio (e.g., --ar 16:9 for widescreen, --ar 9:16 for portrait)
- --v 5/5.1/5.2/6: Model version (higher = newer)
- --q 0.25/0.5/1/2: Quality (higher = more detail, slower)
- --s 0-1000: Stylize amount (higher = more artistic)
- --iw 0-2: Image weight for reference images (higher = more similar)
- --no X: Negative prompt (exclude elements)
- --tile: Create seamless tileable patterns

Example Prompts by Style:

Photorealistic:
"Professional headshot of a business executive, studio lighting, neutral background, 8k, photorealistic --ar 1:1 --v 6"

Digital Art:
"Futuristic cyberpunk city at night, neon lights reflecting on wet streets, flying cars, highly detailed --ar 16:9 --s 750"

Oil Painting:
"Serene countryside landscape with rolling hills and a small cottage, impressionist oil painting style, warm golden hour lighting --ar 3:2"

Fantasy:
"Ancient dragon perched on a mountain peak, scales shimmering with magical energy, epic fantasy art, detailed --ar 2:3 --s 500"

Abstract:
"Flowing liquid metal forms intertwining, iridescent colors, abstract sculpture, studio lighting --ar 1:1 --s 1000"

Product Photography:
"Luxury watch on black velvet, studio product photography, dramatic lighting, reflections --ar 4:5 --q 2"

Tips for Best Results:
1. Be specific about what you want
2. Include lighting descriptions (golden hour, dramatic, soft, studio)
3. Mention camera/lens style for photos (35mm, wide angle, macro)
4. Reference art styles or artists for creative work
5. Use negative prompts (--no) to exclude unwanted elements
6. Experiment with stylize values for different aesthetics
7. Try different aspect ratios for different compositions

    Returns:

    return """Midjourney Transform Actions:

From 2x2 Grid (after initial generation):
- upscale1: Upscale top-left image
- upscale2: Upscale top-right image
- upscale3: Upscale bottom-left image
- upscale4: Upscale bottom-right image
- variation1: Create variations of top-left image
- variation2: Create variations of top-right image
- variation3: Create variations of bottom-left image
- variation4: Create variations of bottom-right image
- reroll: Regenerate all 4 images with same prompt

After Upscaling:
- upscale_2x: Upscale the image by 2x (double resolution)
- upscale_4x: Upscale the image by 4x (quadruple resolution)
- variation_subtle: Create subtle variations
- variation_strong: Create stronger variations
- zoom_out_2x: Zoom out by 2x (expand canvas)
- zoom_out_1_5x: Zoom out by 1.5x
- pan_left: Expand image to the left
- pan_right: Expand image to the right
- pan_up: Expand image upward
- pan_down: Expand image downward

Special Actions:
- variation_region: Regenerate specific region using mask
  (requires mask parameter with Base64-encoded image)

Typical Workflow:
1. Generate: midjourney_imagine("prompt")
2. Select: midjourney_transform(image_id, "upscale2")
3. Enhance: midjourney_transform(new_id, "upscale_4x")
4. Expand: midjourney_transform(new_id, "zoom_out_2x")
