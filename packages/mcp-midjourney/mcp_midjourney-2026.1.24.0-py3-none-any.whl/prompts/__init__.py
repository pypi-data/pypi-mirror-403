def midjourney_image_generation_guide() -> str:
    """Guide for choosing the right Midjourney tool for image generation."""
    return """# Midjourney Image Generation Guide

When the user wants to generate images, choose the appropriate tool based on their needs:

## Basic Image Generation
**Tool:** `midjourney_imagine`
**Use when:**
- User gives a description of what they want to see
- User wants to create new images from scratch
- Simple text-to-image generation

**Example:** "Create a sunset over mountains"
→ Call `midjourney_imagine` with prompt="Breathtaking sunset over mountain range, golden hour, dramatic clouds, landscape photography"

## Image Transformation
**Tool:** `midjourney_transform`
**Use when:**
- User wants to upscale one of the 4 generated images
- User wants variations of a specific image
- User wants to zoom out or pan an image

**Example:** "Upscale the second image"
→ Call `midjourney_transform` with image_id and action="upscale2"

## Image Blending
**Tool:** `midjourney_blend`
**Use when:**
- User wants to combine multiple images
- User provides multiple image URLs to merge
- Creative image fusion is needed

**Example:** "Blend these two images together"
→ Call `midjourney_blend` with list of image URLs and optional prompt

## Reference-Based Generation
**Tool:** `midjourney_with_reference`
**Use when:**
- User provides a reference image to modify
- User wants to apply a new style to an existing image
- User wants to reimagine an image with changes

**Example:** "Make this photo look like a watercolor painting"
→ Call `midjourney_with_reference` with reference_image_url and style prompt

## Image Editing
**Tool:** `midjourney_edit`
**Use when:**
- User wants to edit a specific image with AI
- User provides an image URL and edit instructions
- Targeted modifications to existing images

## Image Description
**Tool:** `midjourney_describe`
**Use when:**
- User wants to understand what prompts would recreate an image
- Reverse prompt engineering
- Getting inspiration from existing artwork

## Important Notes:
1. Image generation is async - always return the task_id to the user
2. Default mode is 'fast' (good balance of speed and credits)
3. Use 'turbo' for faster results (more credits)
4. Use 'relax' for slower, cheaper generation

@mcp.prompt()
def midjourney_workflow_examples() -> str:
    """Common workflow examples for Midjourney image generation."""
    return """# Midjourney Workflow Examples

## Workflow 1: Quick Image Generation
1. User: "Create a cyberpunk city"
2. Call `midjourney_imagine(prompt="Cyberpunk city at night, neon lights, rain, futuristic, detailed --ar 16:9")`
3. Return task_id and image_url to user
4. User can check status with `midjourney_get_task(task_id)`

## Workflow 2: Upscaling Best Image
1. Generate initial image with `midjourney_imagine`
2. User picks favorite from the 2x2 grid (e.g., "I like the top right one")
3. Call `midjourney_transform(image_id, action="upscale2")`
4. For even higher resolution: `midjourney_transform(new_image_id, action="upscale_4x")`

## Workflow 3: Creating Variations
1. Generate initial image with `midjourney_imagine`
2. User wants more options like a specific image
3. Call `midjourney_transform(image_id, action="variation3")`
4. This generates 4 new variations based on that image

## Workflow 4: Image Blending
1. User provides multiple image URLs
2. Call `midjourney_blend(image_urls=[url1, url2], prompt="Combine the face with the background")`
3. Return blended result

## Workflow 5: Style Transfer
1. User provides reference image URL
2. User describes new style: "Make it look like Van Gogh"
3. Call `midjourney_with_reference(reference_image_url, prompt="in the style of Van Gogh, Starry Night, swirling brushstrokes")`

## Workflow 6: Video from Image
1. User has an image they want to animate
2. Call `midjourney_generate_video(image_url, prompt="Gentle wind blowing through the scene")`
3. For longer video: `midjourney_extend_video(video_id, prompt="Continue the motion")`

## Tips:
- Always be descriptive in prompts - include style, lighting, mood, composition
- Use aspect ratio parameter (--ar) for specific dimensions
- Use --no parameter to exclude unwanted elements
- For Chinese speakers, offer translation with `midjourney_translate`
