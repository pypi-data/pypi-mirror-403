    For all the pre-existing SupplierInvoice, there was no official_number, but
    the id was used as such.

    Initialy, supplierinvoice_number_template is initialized to `{SEQGLOBAL}` (see
    migration 35e9bfc2ae2c).

    So, we initialize existing official_number with the SupplierInvoice.id. And
    fill the sequence_number table accordingly. Note that this will create
    holes in sequences for existing ids.

    This migrations considers that no SupplierInvoice have been numbered with the
    new mechanism yet.
