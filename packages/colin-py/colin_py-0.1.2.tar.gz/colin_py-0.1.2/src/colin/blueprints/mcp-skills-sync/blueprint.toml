about = """
Downloads skills from a FastMCP skill server and installs them locally. Skills
are tracked for changes, so running `colin run` again will only update files
that have changed on the server.

After initialization, you'll configure your FastMCP skills server and run
`colin run` to download the skills.
"""
instructions = """
## Configure your skills server

The server must serve skills using FastMCP's `skill://` resource scheme.
See: https://gofastmcp.com/servers/providers/skills

Add an MCP server named `source` (the template references `colin.mcp.source`):

```bash
colin mcp add source "uvx my-skills-server"
```

Or for a remote HTTP server:

```bash
colin mcp add source "https://skills.example.com/mcp" -t http
```

## Download the skills

```bash
colin run
```

Skills are installed to `~/.claude/skills/` by default. To install to the
current project instead, set `scope = "project"` in `colin.toml`.
