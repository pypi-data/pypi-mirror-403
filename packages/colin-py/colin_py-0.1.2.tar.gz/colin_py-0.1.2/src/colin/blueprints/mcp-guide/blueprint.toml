about = """
Generates a skill that teaches AI agents how to use an MCP server. Connects to
the server, discovers its tools, and creates documentation for each one.

After initialization, you'll configure your MCP server and run `colin run` to
generate the skill documentation.
"""
instructions = """
## Configure your MCP server

Add an MCP server named `source` (the template references `colin.mcp.source`):

```bash
colin mcp add source "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path"
```

Or for a Python-based server:

```bash
colin mcp add source "uvx mcp-server-git"
```

## Generate the skill

```bash
colin run
```

The skill will be written to the output directory configured in `colin.toml`.
