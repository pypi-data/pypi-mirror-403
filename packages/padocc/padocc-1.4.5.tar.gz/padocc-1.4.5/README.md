# PADOCC Package

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/padocc.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/padocc/)

Padocc (Pipeline to Aggregate Data for Optimal Cloud Capabilities) is a Data Aggregation pipeline for creating Kerchunk (or alternative) files to represent various datasets in different original formats.
Currently the Pipeline supports writing JSON/Parquet Kerchunk files for input NetCDF/HDF files. Further developments will allow GeoTiff, GRIB and possibly MetOffice (.pp) files to be represented, as well as using the Pangeo [Rechunker](https://rechunker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) tool to create Zarr stores for Kerchunk-incompatible datasets.
