class DirectoryMixin(LoggedOperation):

    Container class for Operations which require functionality to create
    directories (workdir, groupdir, cache etc.)

    This Mixin enables all child classes the ability
    to manipulate the filesystem to create new directories
    as required, and handles the so-called fh-kwargs, which
    relate to forceful overwrites of filesystem objects, 
    skipping creation or starting from scratch, all relating
    to the filesystem.

    This is a behavioural Mixin class and thus should not be
    directly accessed. Where possible, encapsulated classes 
    should contain all relevant parameters for their operation
    as per convention, however this is not the case for mixin
    classes. The mixin classes here will explicitly state
    where they are designed to be used, as an extension of an 
    existing class.
