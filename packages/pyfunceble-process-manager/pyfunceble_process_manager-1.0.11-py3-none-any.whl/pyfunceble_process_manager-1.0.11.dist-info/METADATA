# pyfunceble-process-manager

**The process manager library for and from the PyFunceble project.**

This is a project component that was initially part of the PyFunceble project.
It aims to separate the process manager from the main project to allow others
to use it without the need to install the whole PyFunceble project.

# Installation

```sh
pip3 install pyfunceble-process-manager
```

## Reserved Messages

As we implement our very own "message system" to communicate between the
processes, we have reserved some messages that you should not use in your
implementation.

| Message                  | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `__stop__`               | This message is used to instruct the worker to start the shutdown process.                                                                                        |
| `__immediate_shutdown__` | This message is used to instruct the worker to shutdown immediately.                                                                                              |
| `__wait__`               | This message is used to instruct the worker to wait for the next message. _Sending this message will actually make the worker re-execute any (preflight) checks._ |


## Example

```python
import logging
import sys
from typing import Any

from PyFunceble.ext.process_manager import ProcessManagerCore, WorkerCore


class DataFilterWorker(WorkerCore):
    def perform_external_poweron_checks(self) -> bool:

        # If False is returned, the worker will not start.
        return super().perform_external_poweron_checks()

    def perform_external_poweroff_checks(self) -> bool:
        # This can be used to perform checks before stopping the worker.
        return super().perform_external_poweroff_checks()

    def perform_external_preflight_checks(self) -> bool:
        # This can be used to implement your own logic before the worker
        # starts processing the next data.
        return super().perform_external_preflight_checks()

    def perform_external_inflight_checks(self, consumed: Any) -> bool:
        # This can be used to filter out the consumed data by returning False.
        # For example, filter out data that is not a string.

        print("DataFilter consumed:", consumed)

        if not isinstance(consumed, str):

            print("DataFilter filtered out:", consumed)

            return False
        return super().perform_external_inflight_checks(consumed)

    def perform_external_postflight_checks(self, produced: Any) -> bool:
        # This can be used to implement your own logic after the worker
        # has processed the data.

        print("DataFilter produced:", produced)
        return super().perform_external_postflight_checks(produced)

    def target(self, consumed: Any) -> Any:
        # Here we simply convert the string to uppercase as an example of data
        # processing.
        return consumed.upper()
