LangGraph Agent Toolkit Documentation
====================================

A comprehensive toolkit for building, deploying, and managing AI agents using
LangGraph, FastAPI, and Streamlit. It provides a production-ready framework for
creating conversational AI agents with features like multi-provider LLM support,
streaming responses, observability, and memory management.

What is langgraph-agent-toolkit?
--------------------------------

The langgraph-agent-toolkit is a full-featured framework for developing and
deploying AI agent services. Built on the foundation of:

- **LangGraph** for agent creation with advanced flows and human-in-the-loop capabilities
- **FastAPI** for robust, high-performance API services with streaming support
- **Streamlit** for intuitive user interfaces

Key components include:

- Data structures and settings built with **Pydantic**
- Multi-provider LLM support 
- Comprehensive memory management and persistence using PostgreSQL/SQLite
- Advanced observability tooling via Langfuse and Langsmith
- Modular architecture allowing customization while maintaining a consistent
  application structure

Whether you're building a simple chatbot or complex multi-agent system, this
toolkit provides the infrastructure to develop, test, and deploy your
LangGraph-based agents with confidence.
