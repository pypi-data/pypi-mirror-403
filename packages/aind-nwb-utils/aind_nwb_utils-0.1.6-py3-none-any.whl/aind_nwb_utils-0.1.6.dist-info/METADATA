## Usage
This package is intended to simplify and standardize the process of creating and interacting with NWB files. It is still in the early development stages, and the API and naming conventions are subject to change at any time.

## Installation
To use the software, in the root directory, run
```bash
pip install -e .
```

To develop the code, run
```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Linters and testing

There are several libraries used to run linters, check documentation, and run tests.

- Please test your changes using the **coverage** library, which will run the tests and log a coverage report:

```bash
coverage run -m unittest discover && coverage report
```

- Use **interrogate** to check that modules, methods, etc. have been documented thoroughly:

```bash
interrogate .
```

- Use **flake8** to check that code is up to standards (no unused imports, etc.):
```bash
flake8 .
```

- Use **black** to automatically format the code into PEP standards:
```bash
black .
```

- Use **isort** to automatically sort import statements:
```bash
isort .
```

### Pull requests

For internal members, please create a branch. For external members, please fork the repository and open a pull request from the fork. We'll primarily use [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit) style for commit messages. Roughly, they should follow the pattern:
```text
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

where scope (optional) describes the packages affected by the code changes and type (mandatory) is one of:

- **build**: Changes that affect build tools or external dependencies (example scopes: pyproject.toml, setup.py)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: .github/workflows/ci.yml)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bugfix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Semantic Release

The table below, from [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), shows which commit message gets you which release type when `semantic-release` runs (using the default configuration):

| Commit message                                                                                                                                                                                   | Release type                                                                                                    |

### Documentation
To generate the rst files source files for documentation, run
```bash
sphinx-apidoc -o doc_template/source/ src 
```
Then to create the documentation HTML files, run
```bash
sphinx-build -b html doc_template/source/ doc_template/build/html
```
More info on sphinx installation can be found [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html).
