## Types of Contributions

Currently we are accepting limited external contribution but as we feel more
confident in the direction of the library we will open up more avenue for contribution.

### Report Bugs

Report bugs by dropping an email to [harsh](mailto:harsh@ikigailabs.io) or [jae](mailto:simjae@ikigailabs.io).

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your installed ikigai package version, operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug including any relevant code snippets
  or setup on the ikigai platform.
- Any tracebacks that were encountered and the expected outcome.

### Submit Feedback

If you would like to request some feature or QOL improvements to the library
you can send us an email requesting the feature.

When proposing a feature please:

- Explain in detail how you would like it to work;
  what usecase does it enable or simplify?
- Try to keep the scope as detailed and narrow as possible to improve
  turn-around times.

## Getting Started

Ready to contribute to the library? Here's the steps to get you started with
developing the library and testing it locally.
We use [hatch][hatch] as the project manager that handles the development
environment, tests, and builds for the project.

To install hatch follow the [instructions for your system][hatch-install].

To verify that you have hatch install correctly run:

```sh
$ hatch --version
Hatch, version 1.X.X
```

Next you should clone the repo locally with:

```sh
git clone git@bitbucket.org:ikigailabs/ikigai_client.git
cd ikigai_client
```

Let's get a quick run-down of the structure of the project:

```txt
.
├── LICENSE.txt          // Licensing info for the package
├── CONTRIBUTING.md      // <-- You are here!
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml       // Configuration file for the package
├── src/ikigai           // Source code of the package
│   ├── __about__.py     // Package metadata such as version, ...
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── components
│   └── ikigai.py        // File containing the main Ikigai client class
└── tests                // Folder containing tests for the package
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── conftest.py      // Fixtures & config for all tests
    ├── components
    └── test_ikigai.py
```

Now, let's setup the pre-commit hooks to automatically format the code
and run linters when you commit changes. Install the pre-commit tool
by following the [official instructions][pre-commit-install]. After installing
pre-commit, run the following command to install the hooks:

```sh
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Next let's setup your `test-env.toml`.
Get your api key by logging in on [ikigai][ikigai] > Profile > Keys
Fill in your email id and api key into the following command and run it.

```sh
cat > ./test-env.toml <<'/EOF'
[credentials.users.test-user]
user_email="<YOUR-REGISTERED-EMAIL>"
api_key="<YOUR-API-KEY>"
base_url="https://api.ikigailabs.io"
/EOF
```

With that you are set to contribute to this project. Let try to run the tests
and see coverage statistics to validate that setup was a success.

```sh
hatch test --cover
```

It might take some time when you first run this command,
hatch will setup the testing environment and install any required dependencies
as specified in the `pyproject.toml` file.

If everything went well, you will see something like:

## Tips and Tricks

### Releasing new version

To release new version you can run:

```sh
make release (TAG=[micro|minor|major])
```

Which in turn bumps the version using `hatch version`.
Ex.

```sh
$ hatch version micro
Old: 0.2.8
New: 0.2.9
```

After this it commits any files hatch changed when updating the version.
And creates a tag to go along with the commit. Using the following template
for commit message and tag:

```txt
$ git commit -m "Bump version to v$(hatch version)"
[main XXXXXXX] Bump version to v0.2.9
 1 file changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)

$ git tag "v$(hatch version)"
```

Finally it pushes the commit and tag

```sh
git push && git push --tags
```

As the final step create a new release on [github-releases][github-releases]
using the tag that was just created. This will trigger the CD to build and
upload the new version to PyPI.

### Profiling tests

We bundle the command `test-prof` to profile the execution of the tests.
To vizualize the results of profiling we use `graphviz`, install it by
following the official [graphviz page][graphviz-page].

Then run:

```sh
hatch test --profile --profile-svg
```

If you don't want to install graphviz then drop the `--profile-svg` flag
from the command.
