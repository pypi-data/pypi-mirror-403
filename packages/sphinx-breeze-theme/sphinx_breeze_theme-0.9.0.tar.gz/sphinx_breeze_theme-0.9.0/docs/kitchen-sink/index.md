# Kitchen Sink

````{note}
The Kitchen Sink was generated from the [Sphinx Themes website](https://sphinx-themes.org/), a community-supported showcase of themes for [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/). Check it out to see other great themes.

This section exists as a dump of all the things that Sphinx has.

It has exactly one goal: to be a good checklist of things to stylise within Sphinx. This also means that it is a complete showcase of *everything* that vanilla Sphinx provides and includes all sorts of edge cases.
