## "Digital4Climate" Program - €75M over 5 years

Cross-functional strategic program led by **Marie Dupont**, newly appointed Climate & Transition Director (direct CEO reporting).

### Pillar 1: Green Data Centers (€35M)

**100% renewable electricity from 2026**

- PPA contracts (Power Purchase Agreement) offshore wind (180 GWh/year)
- On-site solar panels (Marseille): 5 MW peak
- Storage batteries (intermittent production smoothing)

**PUE optimization to 1.2 (vs 1.45 current)**

- Natural free-cooling (outside air) at Amsterdam site
- Adiabatic cooling Munich
- Waste heat recovery: district heating Marseille (2 MW thermal)

### Pillar 2: IT Circular Economy (€20M)

**Server lifespan extension**

- Shift from 4 to 6 years (2027 target)
- Internal refurbishment (+30% savings vs new)

**Certified recycling**

- Partnership with **EcoSystem** (WEEE eco-organization)
- Complete traceability of critical components (rare earths)
- Target recycling rate: 90% (vs 75% current)

### Pillar 3: Value Chain Engagement (€15M)

**Supplier decarbonization**

- Carbon criterion in 100% of tenders from 2026
- Support for 50 strategic suppliers (carbon footprint)
- Target: -30% carbon intensity of purchases by 2030

**Sustainable mobility**

- 100% electric vehicle fleet (2027)
- Soft mobility bonus for employees (bicycle, public transport)
- Remote work: 2 days/week minimum (reduced commuting)

### Pillar 4: Research & Innovation (€5M)

**"GreenOps" R&D Program**

- Algorithm optimization (reduced computation time)
- AI for server load prediction (energy efficiency)
- Immersive liquid cooling (2026 pilot)

## Identified Climate Risks

### Transition risks

1. **Technological obsolescence**
   - Current equipment less efficient (high PUE)
   - Risk of competitiveness loss against greener players
   - Mitigation: massive energy efficiency investments

2. **Mandatory CSRD regulation**
   - Mandatory sustainability reporting from FY 2025
   - Limited then reasonable assurance (2026)
   - Dedicated resources: ESG team of 5 people established

3. **Growing client expectations**
   - Tenders including carbon criteria (60% in 2024 vs 25% in 2022)
   - Risk of market loss if footprint too high

### Physical risks

1. **Heatwaves and cooling**
   - Marseille site exposed to heat waves
   - Impact on cooling efficiency (degraded PUE in summer)
   - Mitigation: free-cooling investment + thermal insulation

2. **Water stress**
   - Cooling towers at Munich site (water consumption)
   - Measure: shift to adiabatic cooling (reduction -70%)

## Carbon Credits and Residual Compensation

### Compensation strategy

TechGreen applies the carbon hierarchy: **Reduction > Sequestration > Compensation**

#### Phase 1 (2025-2030): Priority reduction

- Focus on absolute Scope 1+2 reduction
- No compensation used (to avoid masking real progress)

#### Phase 2 (2030-2040): Residual compensation

- **5,000 VCS credits** purchased in advance (certified reforestation projects)
  - Amazon project (Brazil): 3,000 credits
  - Madagascar project: 2,000 credits
- Verification of co-benefits (biodiversity, local jobs)

### Own sequestration projects

**"TechForest" Program**

- **200 hectares reforested** (Massif Central, France)
- Sequestration capacity: 4,000 tCO2e/year (at maturity, 15-20 years)
- Partnership with ONF (French National Forestry Office)
- Mixed local species (climate resilience)
- "Label Bas-Carbone" certification obtained
