# AI Agent Instructions

## Important: This is a Generated SDK

This SDK is **auto-generated** by [Stainless](https://www.stainless.com/) from an OpenAPI specification. Do not manually edit generated files—your changes will be overwritten on the next generation.

## What You Should NOT Do

- Do not modify files outside of the safe directories listed below
- Do not refactor, reorganize, or "improve" generated code
- Do not add new API methods or modify existing ones directly
- Do not update type definitions for API responses/requests

## Safe Directories (Not Overwritten by Generator)

The following directories are preserved between generations and can be safely edited:

- `src/gumnut/lib/` - Custom library code
- `examples/` - Example usage code

## If Changes Are Needed

If the SDK needs changes (new endpoints, bug fixes, type corrections):

1. Changes should be made to the **OpenAPI specification** or **Stainless configuration**, not this repository directly
2. The SDK will be regenerated with the updates
3. See the [Stainless documentation](https://www.stainless.com/docs/) for how SDK generation works
