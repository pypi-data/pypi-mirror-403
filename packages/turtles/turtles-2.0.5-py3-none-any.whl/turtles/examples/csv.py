# --- Quoting ---

# Any char except a double quote. Includes CR/LF, commas, etc.

# --- Unquoted fields ---
# Typical CSV: unquoted fields end at delimiter or record separator.
# Also disallow raw quotes in unquoted fields (common strict-ish behavior).
# 
# UnquotedChar matches any character except: comma, newline, CR, and quote.
# This ensures the field naturally stops at delimiters and record separators.
class UnquotedChar(Rule):
    ch: char[
        "\x00-\x09"         # include tabs and control chars except LF/CR       # noqa
        "\x0B-\x0C"
        "\x0E-\x21"         # up to '!' (0x21), excludes '"'(0x22)

        "\x2D-\U0010FFFF"   # '-'..unicode max (excludes ',' 0x2C)
    ]


# UnquotedField: one or more UnquotedChar characters.
# This will naturally stop when it encounters a comma, newline, CR, or quote
# because UnquotedChar excludes those characters.
# Note: we require at_least[1] so that truly empty fields return None from optional[Field]
class UnquotedField(Rule, str):

# UnquotedField.longest_match = True

Field = QuotedField | UnquotedField

# --- Records (this is the key part to support empty fields cleanly) ---
# record := [field] (delim [field])*
#
# That means:
#   ""         -> one empty unquoted field (Field present but length 0)
#   ,a,        -> first optional[Field] is missing => leading empty field
#                then ",a" then "," with missing field => trailing empty
#
# We structure this as: first field (optional), then zero or more delimiter+field pairs
class Record(Rule):
    fields: repeat[optional[Field], separator[Delim]]



# --- Top-level file ---
# Structured so separators are required between records, making the grammar unambiguous.
# First record has no leading separator; subsequent records require a separator before them.
# This prevents trailing newlines from creating spurious empty records.


class CSV(Rule):
    optional[BOM]
    records: repeat[Record, separator[RecordSep]]

# Variant that allows spaces/tabs after commas (like skipinitialspace):
