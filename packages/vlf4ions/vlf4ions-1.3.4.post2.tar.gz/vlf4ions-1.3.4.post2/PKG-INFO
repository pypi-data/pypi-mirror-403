![Coverage Status](./reports/coverage/coverage-badge.svg)

This is the cleaner version of the vlf4ions library, which I am using both to store the code and the different versions, but also to learn how to do it properly.
NOTE: This is a version of the code migrated from GitHub. It is the most up-to-date one, but some links to issues for previous commits may not work anymore

This library is designed for VLF-antenna owners. It allows the detection of solar flares in real-time from ground-based VLF data. An estimate of the solar X-ray flux from the Sun is also made possible.
Though it was designed with an AWESOME instrument in mind, it can be adapted to any type of VLF antennas, provided that both amplitude and phase measurements are available for any transmitter of interest.

# Aknowledgements

Many thanks to Pierre-Yves Martin and Xavier Bonnin for their help with the licence and all other aspects of publishing an open-source project. This project really would have taken much longer to deploy if not for their advice !
