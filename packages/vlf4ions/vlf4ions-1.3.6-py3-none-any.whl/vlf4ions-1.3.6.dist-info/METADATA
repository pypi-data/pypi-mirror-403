This is the cleaner version of the vlf4ions library, which I am using both to store the code and the different versions, but also to learn how to do it properly.
NOTE: This is a version of the code migrated from GitHub. It is the most up-to-date one, but some links to issues for previous commits may not work anymore

This library is designed for VLF-antenna owners. It allows the detection of solar flares in real-time from ground-based VLF data. An estimate of the solar X-ray flux from the Sun is also made possible.
Though it was designed with an AWESOME instrument in mind, it can be adapted to any type of VLF antennas, provided that both amplitude and phase measurements are available for any transmitter of interest.

# Installation

To install the package, go to [Release](https://codeberg.org/pteysseyre/vlf4ions_library/releases) at the top of the page and download the latest version. In the `zip` or `tar.gz` folder, you should find a file ending in `.whl`. In a terminal, write

````
pip install file_in_.whl
````

# Testing

To test the entire package, you can run

````
pytest
````

This is the minimal version to check that all tests are passed. If, however, you're developping your own branch of the repository, or if you want the coverage report, run:

````
pytest --cov=vlf4ions --cov-report=xml:reports/coverage/coverage.xml
coverage html
genbadge coverage -o reports/coverage/coverage-badge.svg
````

This will create a full coverage report and a badge to display the new coverage

# Documentation

# Contributing

Any feedback or contribution is very welcome. Please use pull requests to contribute to this package, or directly open an issue if you notice that something is wrong or can be enhanced.

Any question may also be sent to me by email if needed, or by pinging me on Codeberg.

# Aknowledgements

Many thanks to Pierre-Yves Martin and Xavier Bonnin for their help with the licence and all other aspects of publishing an open-source project. This project really would have taken much longer to deploy if not for their advice !
