This module helps maintain the employee motivation process through
periodic performance appraisals.

Managers can evaluate employee performance and enable employees to
perform self-assessments. Review forms can be customized according to
organizational needs.

Usage
=====

To create a new appraisal for an employee, first navigate to the main
Appraisals dashboard by opening the Appraisals app. The Appraisals
dashboard is the default view.

All appraisals are displayed on the dashboard in a default Kanban view.
To view the details of any appraisal, click on the card to open the
appraisal form.

1. Create an appraisal: To create a new appraisal, click the New button
in the upper-left corner of the Appraisals dashboard. Doing so reveals a
blank appraisal form. After entering a name in the first blank field,
proceed to enter the following information on the form: \* Employee:
Select the employee for whom you are creating the appraisal. \*
Managers: Select the managers who will be involved in the appraisal
process. \* Date Close: Select the date when the appraisal is expected
to be completed. \* Appraisal Template: Select the template that will be
used for this appraisal. \* Appraisal Tags: Add any relevant tags to
categorize the appraisal.

Once the form is complete, click the Confirm button to confirm the
appraisal request.

Once confirmed, the employee receives an email stating that an appraisal
was requested, and is then prompted to schedule an appraisal date. The
next steps require the employee to fill out the self-assessment, after
which the manager completes their assessment.

The status changes to Confirmed, and the Employee’s Feedback section of
the Appraisal tab is grayed out. The information in that section only
appears after the self-assessment is published by the employee.

If there are any existing appraisals for the employee, an Appraisal
smart button appears at the top of the page, listing the total number of
appraisals there are for the employee.

2. Employee’s feedback To complete their portion of feedback, employees
should navigate to the main Appraisals application dashboard, where the
only entries visible are appraisals for the employee, themselves, and/or
anyone they manage and have to provide manager feedback for.

Click on the appraisal to open the appraisal form. Enter responses in
the Employee’s Feedback section, under the Appraisal tab.

When completed, click the Not Visible to Manager toggle (the default
setting once an appraisal is confirmed). When clicked, the toggle
changes to Visible to Manager.

3. Manager’s feedback After the employee has completed the Employee’s
Feedback section, under the Appraisal tab, it is time for the manager to
fill out the Manager’s Feedback section.

The manager enters their responses in the fields in the same manner as
the employee.

When the feedback section is completed, click the Not Visible to
Employee toggle (the default setting once an appraisal is confirmed).
When clicked, the toggle changes to Visible to Employee.

4. Private Note tab If managers want to leave notes that are only
visible to other managers, they can be entered in the Private Note tab.
This can be done before or after meeting with the employee to discuss
the appraisal.

The employee being evaluated does not have access to this tab, and the
tab does not appear on their appraisal.

5. Complete an appraisal After the appraisal is complete, and both the
manager and employee have met to discuss the appraisal, the appraisal
can be marked as Done. When completed, click the Mark as Done button on
the appraisal form, located in the top-left corner.

Once the appraisal is marked as Done, the Mark as Done button
disappears, and a Reopen button appears.

6. Permissions and User Types To manage access permissions to the
Appraisals app, go to Settings > Users & Companies > Users and select
the desired user. In the Access tab, you will find the Appraisal
Permissions section. The following user types are available:

- User: Can access their own appraisals and complete evaluations of
  their direct and indirect reporting employees.
- Human resources officer: Has full access to all appraisals and
  settings, and can manage templates, tags, permissions, and all
  records.

Make sure to assign the appropriate access type based on the user's role
in the organization. Permissions determine what actions each user can
perform within the Appraisals module.

7. Archive and Restore Appraisals To archive an appraisal, open the
record and select Archive from the Action menu. Archived appraisals are
hidden from the main views.

To view archived appraisals, use the Archived filter in the search bar.

To restore an appraisal, open it (with the Archived filter active) and
click Restore.

Archiving does not delete the record; you can archive or restore
appraisals at any time.

- Tip

Modifications are not possible once the appraisal is marked as done.

To make any changes to an appraisal that is marked as Done, click the
Reopen button.

Then, click the Confirm button that appears, and make any modifications
needed. Once all modifications are complete, click the Mark as Done
button again.
