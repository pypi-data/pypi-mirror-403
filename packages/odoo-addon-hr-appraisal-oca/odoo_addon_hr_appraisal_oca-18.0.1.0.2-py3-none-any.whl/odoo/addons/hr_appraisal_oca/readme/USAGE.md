To create a new appraisal for an employee, first navigate to the main Appraisals
dashboard by opening the Appraisals app. The Appraisals dashboard is the default view.

All appraisals are displayed on the dashboard in a default Kanban view. To view the
details of any appraisal, click on the card to open the appraisal form.

1\. Create an appraisal: To create a new appraisal, click the New button in the
upper-left corner of the Appraisals dashboard. Doing so reveals a blank appraisal form.
After entering a name in the first blank field, proceed to enter the following
information on the form: \* Employee: Select the employee for whom you are creating the
appraisal. \* Managers: Select the managers who will be involved in the appraisal
process. \* Date Close: Select the date when the appraisal is expected to be
completed. \* Appraisal Template: Select the template that will be used for this
appraisal. \* Appraisal Tags: Add any relevant tags to categorize the appraisal.

Once the form is complete, click the Confirm button to confirm the appraisal request.

Once confirmed, the employee receives an email stating that an appraisal was requested,
and is then prompted to schedule an appraisal date. The next steps require the employee
to fill out the self-assessment, after which the manager completes their assessment.

The status changes to Confirmed, and the Employee’s Feedback section of the Appraisal
tab is grayed out. The information in that section only appears after the
self-assessment is published by the employee.

If there are any existing appraisals for the employee, an Appraisal smart button appears
at the top of the page, listing the total number of appraisals there are for the
employee.

2\. Employee’s feedback To complete their portion of feedback, employees should navigate
to the main Appraisals application dashboard, where the only entries visible are
appraisals for the employee, themselves, and/or anyone they manage and have to provide
manager feedback for.

Click on the appraisal to open the appraisal form. Enter responses in the Employee’s
Feedback section, under the Appraisal tab.

When completed, click the Not Visible to Manager toggle (the default setting once an
appraisal is confirmed). When clicked, the toggle changes to Visible to Manager.

3\. Manager’s feedback After the employee has completed the Employee’s Feedback section,
under the Appraisal tab, it is time for the manager to fill out the Manager’s Feedback
section.

The manager enters their responses in the fields in the same manner as the employee.

When the feedback section is completed, click the Not Visible to Employee toggle (the
default setting once an appraisal is confirmed). When clicked, the toggle changes to
Visible to Employee.

4\. Private Note tab If managers want to leave notes that are only visible to other
managers, they can be entered in the Private Note tab. This can be done before or after
meeting with the employee to discuss the appraisal.

The employee being evaluated does not have access to this tab, and the tab does not
appear on their appraisal.

5\. Complete an appraisal After the appraisal is complete, and both the manager and
employee have met to discuss the appraisal, the appraisal can be marked as Done. When
completed, click the Mark as Done button on the appraisal form, located in the top-left
corner.

Once the appraisal is marked as Done, the Mark as Done button disappears, and a Reopen
button appears.

6\. Permissions and User Types To manage access permissions to the Appraisals app, go to
Settings > Users & Companies > Users and select the desired user. In the Access tab, you
will find the Appraisal Permissions section. The following user types are available:

- User: Can access their own appraisals and complete evaluations of their direct and
  indirect reporting employees.
- Human resources officer: Has full access to all appraisals and settings, and can
  manage templates, tags, permissions, and all records.

Make sure to assign the appropriate access type based on the user's role in the
organization. Permissions determine what actions each user can perform within the
Appraisals module.

7\. Archive and Restore Appraisals To archive an appraisal, open the record and select
Archive from the Action menu. Archived appraisals are hidden from the main views.

To view archived appraisals, use the Archived filter in the search bar.

To restore an appraisal, open it (with the Archived filter active) and click Restore.

Archiving does not delete the record; you can archive or restore appraisals at any time.

- Tip

Modifications are not possible once the appraisal is marked as done.

To make any changes to an appraisal that is marked as Done, click the Reopen button.

Then, click the Confirm button that appears, and make any modifications needed. Once all
modifications are complete, click the Mark as Done button again.
