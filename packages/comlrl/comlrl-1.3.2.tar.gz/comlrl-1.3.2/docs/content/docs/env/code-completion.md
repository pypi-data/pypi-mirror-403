Multi-agent autocompletion tasks where each model fills in part of a codebase.
The [LLM_Collab_Code_Completion](https://github.com/OpenMLRL/LLM_Collab_Code_Completion)
project currently focuses on **ClassEval**, which asks teams of LLMs to finish
class skeletons based on docstrings and partially implemented methods.
