A suite of cooperative programming benchmarks where agents propose, critique, and
refine solutions. The environments shipped in
[LLM_Collab_Code_Generation](https://github.com/OpenMLRL/LLM_Collab_Code_Generation)
cover:

- **MBPP** – mostly basic Python problems for rapid iteration.
- **HumanEval** – handwritten tasks from OpenAI for exact-match grading.
- **CoopHumanEval** – HumanEval variants that explicitly require collaboration.
