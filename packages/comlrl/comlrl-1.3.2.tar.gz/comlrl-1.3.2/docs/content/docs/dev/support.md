We are willing to help you with any issues you encounter while using CoMLRL.

## Report Issues

If you are stuck with a problem using CoMLRL, please follow this procedure:

{{% steps %}}

1. Read the documentation first, including using the search feature (Ctrl + K).

2. Search the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/OpenMLRL/CoMLRL/issues) archives to see if someone else already had the same problem.

3. Before writing, try to create a minimal example that reproduces the problem. You'll get the fastest response if you can send just a handful of lines of code that show what isn't working.
