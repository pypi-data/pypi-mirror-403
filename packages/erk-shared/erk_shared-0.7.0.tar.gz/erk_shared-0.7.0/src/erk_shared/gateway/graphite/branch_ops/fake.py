    -----------------
    This fake maintains mutable state to simulate Graphite's stateful behavior.
    Operations like track_branch modify internal state.
    State changes are visible to subsequent method calls within the same test.

    -----------------
    This fake tracks mutations for test assertions via read-only properties:
    - track_branch_calls: Branches tracked via track_branch()
    - delete_branch_calls: Branches deleted via delete_branch()
    - submit_branch_calls: Branches submitted via submit_branch()
