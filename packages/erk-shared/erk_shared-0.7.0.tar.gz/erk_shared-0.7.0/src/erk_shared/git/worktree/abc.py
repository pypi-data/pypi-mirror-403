"""Abstract interface for git worktree operations.

This module provides a clean abstraction over git worktree subprocess calls,
making the codebase more testable and maintainable.

Architecture:
- Worktree: Abstract base class defining the interface
- RealWorktree: Production implementation using subprocess
- FakeWorktree: In-memory implementation for testing
