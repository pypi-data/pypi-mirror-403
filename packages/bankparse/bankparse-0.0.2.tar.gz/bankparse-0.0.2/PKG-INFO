# bankparse
**bankparse** is a Python package designed to simplify the extraction of your **own** bank data. Indeed in France, it's common that your bank doesn't give you clear analysis on what you spend if you don't subscribe to it. You only receive a pdf file of all your expenses and income of the month. That's why bankparse is here, to simplify the extraction of your data from those pdf files. You can get your data as JSON format or pandas DataFrame with 3 lines of code.
