class AccountExtractionFile(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for bank account statement extractors.

    Any subclass must:
    - Be able to read a bank account statement pdf file (self.content assignment)
    - Implement a method to get the owner and extraction date of the pdf file.

    Attributes :
    - file_path (str): path of the pdf file.
    - owner (str | None): Extracted owner name. None until parsing is done.
    - extraction_date (str | None): Date of issue of the bank statement
    - content (list[str]) : Content of the pdf file, automatically retrieved at instantiation time. Represents the lines of the pdf file. (using pdfplumber) 
    - tables (Any): Optional parsed tables contained in the pdf file. Can contain lists of strings,
    instances of concrete table classes (e.g., CABankingTransactionsTable, CMBankingTransactionsTable),
    or any other structure depending on the implementation made by the user.
