A text-based game generator and extensible sandbox learning environment for training and testing reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Also check out [aka.ms/textworld](https://aka.ms/textworld/) for more info about TextWorld and its creators. Have questions or feedback about TextWorld? Send them to textworld@microsoft.com or use the Gitter channel listed above.

## Installation

TextWorld supports __Python 3.9/3.10/3.11/3.12__ for __Linux__ and __macOS__ systems only at the moment. For __Windows__ users, docker can be used as a workaround (see Docker section below).

### Requirements

TextWorld requires some system libraries for its native components.
On a Debian/Ubuntu-based system, these can be installed with

    sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential libffi-dev python3-dev curl git

And on macOS, with

    brew install libffi curl git

> **Note:** We advise our users to use virtual environments to avoid Python packages from different projects to interfere with each other. Popular choices are [Conda Environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) and [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Installing TextWorld

The easiest way to install TextWorld is via [`pip`](https://pypi.org/):

    pip install textworld

Or, after cloning the repo, go inside the root folder of the project (i.e. alongside `setup.py`) and run

    pip install .

#### Visualization

TextWorld comes with some tools to visualize game states. Make sure all dependencies are installed by running

    pip install textworld[vis]

Then, you will need to install either the [Chrome](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/) or [Firefox](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver) webdriver (depending on which browser you have currently installed).
If you have Chrome already installed you can use the following command to install chromedriver

    pip install chromedriver_installer

Current visualization tools include: `take_screenshot`, `visualize` and `show_graph` from [`textworld.render`](https://textworld.readthedocs.io/en/latest/textworld.render.html).

### Docker

A docker container with the latest TextWorld release is available on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).

    docker pull marccote19/textworld
    docker run -p 8888:8888 -it --rm marccote19/textworld

Then, in your browser, navigate to the Jupyter notebook's link displayed in your terminal. The link should look like this

    http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=8d7aaa...e95

> **Note:** See [README.md](docker/README.md) in the docker folder for troubleshooting information.

## Usage

### Generating a game

TextWorld provides an easy way of generating simple text-based games via the `tw-make` script. For instance,

    tw-make custom --world-size 5 --nb-objects 10 --quest-length 5 --seed 1234 --output tw_games/custom_game.z8

where `custom` indicates we want to customize the game using the following options: `--world-size` controls the number of rooms in the world, `--nb-objects` controls the number of objects that can be interacted with (excluding doors) and `--quest-length` controls the minimum number of commands that is required to type in order to win the game. Once done, the game `custom_game.z8` will be saved in the `tw_games/` folder.

### Playing a game (terminal)

To play a game, one can use the `tw-play` script. For instance, the command to play the game generated in the previous section would be

    tw-play tw_games/custom_game.z8

> **Note:** Only Z-machine's games (*.z1 through *.z8) are supported.

To visualize the game state while playing, use the `--viewer [port]` option.

    tw-play tw_games/custom_game.z8 --viewer

A new browser tab should open and track your progress in the game.

### Playing a game (Python + [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)-like API)

Here's how you can interact with a text-based game from within Python using a Gym-like API.

```python
import textworld.gym

# Register a text-based game as a new environment.
env_id = textworld.gym.register_game("tw_games/custom_game.z8",
                                     max_episode_steps=50)

env = textworld.gym.make(env_id)  # Start the environment.

obs, infos = env.reset()  # Start new episode.
env.render()

score, moves, done = 0, 0, False
while not done:
    command = input("> ")
    obs, score, done, infos = env.step(command)
    env.render()
    moves += 1

env.close()
print("moves: {}; score: {}".format(moves, score))
```

> **Note:** To play text-based games without a Gym-like API, see [Playing text-based games with TextWorld.ipynb](notebooks/Playing%20text-based%20games%20with%20TextWorld.ipynb)

## Documentation

For more information about TextWorld, check the [documentation](https://aka.ms/textworld-docs).

## Visual Studio Code

You can install the [textworld-vscode extension ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=textworld.textworld-vscode) that enables syntax highlighting for editing `.twl` and `.twg` TextWorld files.

## Notebooks

Check the [notebooks](notebooks) provided with the framework to see what you can do with it. You will need the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) to run them. You can install it with

    pip install jupyter
