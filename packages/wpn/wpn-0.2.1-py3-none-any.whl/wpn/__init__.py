WPN (What's Playing Now) Web Scraper

This module provides functionality to scrape song information from the Muzak WPN website.
It retrieves current and historical song data for various music channels/stations.

The WPN class provides methods to:
- Get a directory of available channels
- Retrieve the current song playing on a specific channel
- Get a list of previous songs played on a channel
- Get a complete list of current and previous songs for a channel
- Fetch and process all song data for all available channels

Usage:
    from wpn import WPN

    # Create an instance
    wpn = WPN()

    # Get all available channels
    channels = wpn.channel_list

    # Get current song on a specific channel
    song, artist = wpn.get_current_song("Channel Name")

    # Get all songs (current and previous) for a channel
    songs = wpn.get_all_songs("Channel Name")

    # Get previous songs using negative indices
    recent_song = songs[-1]  # Most recently played song (before current)
    two_songs_ago = songs[-2]  # Second most recently played song

    # Get all song data for all channels
    all_data = wpn.get_all_song_data()
