# DaVinci Resolve REST API

A **Python app** that provides a **REST API** for controlling **DaVinci Resolve** and a **Python client** to easily integrate DaVinci Resolve control into your Python applications.

This package allows users to **create, open, and manage projects**, **import media**, and **add clips to the timeline** through a **FastAPI server** and a **Python client**.

Tested with **DaVinci Resolve 18.6 (Free Version)**. It is likely compatible with newer versions as well.

Although the package is currently in its early stages with a few available endpoints, we are committed to continuously improving it and adding more functionality.

> **Note:** Used by [**ShortFabrik**](https://beluck.net/shortfabrik), a web UI for automated short video creation with DaVinci Resolve.

---

## **Features**

- **Create new projects** in DaVinci Resolve.
- **Open existing projects** with ease.
- **Import media clips** into the Media Pool.
- **Add clips to the timeline** with precise control.

The package includes:

- A **FastAPI server** to expose REST endpoints for DaVinci Resolve.
- A **Python client** for easy interaction from your Python applications.

---

## **Installation**

Install the package directly from **PyPI**:

```bash
pip install davinci-rest
```

> **Note:** Ensure that **DaVinci Resolve** is running and that the **FastAPI server** is started before using the client.

---

## **Starting the FastAPI Server**

The **FastAPI server** must be running to handle REST API requests.

### **Step 1: Move `launch_davinci_rest.py` to DaVinci Resolves Script Folder**

1. Navigate to DaVinci Resolves **Scripts** folder:

   - **Windows:**  
     `C:\ProgramData\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Fusion\Scripts\`

2. Place the `launch_davinci_rest.py` file into the **Scripts** folder.

---

### **Step 2: Run the Server from DaVinci Resolve**

Launch the server from **DaVinci Resolve**:

- Go to **Workspace -> Scripts -> launch_davinci_rest**.

Once the server is running, you can send requests to the REST API at:

```text
http://localhost:5001
```

---

## **Usage Guide**

Here is how to use the **DavinciRestClient** to interact with DaVinci Resolve via the REST API.

### **Import the Client:**

```python
from davinci_rest.client import DavinciRestClient

# Initialize the client
client = DavinciRestClient()
```

### **Example Usage:**

```python
# Create a new project
response = client.create_project("MyProject")
print(response)

# Open an existing project
response = client.open_project("MyProject")
print(response)

# Import a clip into the Media Pool
response = client.import_clip("C:\path\to\clip.mp4", "MyClip")
print(response)

# Add a clip to the timeline
response = client.add_clip_to_timeline("MyClip", start_time=10.0, duration=5.0)
print(response)
```

---

## **Available API Endpoints**

The following endpoints are exposed by the **FastAPI server**:

| **Endpoint**              | **Method** | **Description**                          |
|---------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|
| `/project/create`          | POST       | Create a new project in DaVinci Resolve. |
| `/project/open`            | POST       | Open an existing project.                |
| `/media/import_clip`       | POST       | Import a clip into the Media Pool.       |
| `/timeline/add_clip`       | POST       | Add a clip to the timeline.              |

## **Want More Advanced Features?**

I am thinking of releasing a pro version that will include automatic subtitle generation, the ability to apply FX through the API, and more powerful endpoints for advanced control of DaVinci Resolve workflows.
