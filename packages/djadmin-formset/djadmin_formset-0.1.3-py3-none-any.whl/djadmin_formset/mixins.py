View mixins for djadmin-formset plugin.

Provides minimal glue code to connect djadmin's Layout API to django-formset's
FormCollectionViewMixin. The heavy lifting is done by:
- FormCollectionViewMixin: Handles JSON POST, renders FormCollections
- FormFactory: Converts Layout to FormCollection
- EditCollectionView: Provides form_collection_valid() that saves via construct_instance()

class DjAdminFormsetBaseMixin:
    """
    Base mixin that provides get_collection_class() for FormCollectionViewMixin.

    This mixin provides:
    - build_form() to create FormCollections instead of ModelForms
    - get_collection_class() to convert Layout to FormCollection
    - _flatten_fieldsets_in_place() to preprocess FormCollection structure
    - form_collection_valid() that flattens and delegates to django-formset

    The key insight is that our hierarchical FormCollection structure (Fieldsets, Rows)
    splits fields across multiple forms. We flatten Fieldsets/Rows into single forms
    per instance, then delegate to django-formset's construct_instance() which handles
    both parent fields and Collection (inline) CRUD operations correctly.

    This approach:
    - Eliminates IntegrityError for CREATE (all required fields in one form)
    - Fixes field name conflicts for UPDATE (proper form structure)
    - Works for both CREATE and UPDATE with unified logic
    - Delegates to django-formset for Collections (create/update/delete)

    Subclasses:
    - DjAdminFormsetCreateMixin: For CREATE actions (creates new instance)
    - DjAdminFormsetUpdateMixin: For UPDATE actions (loads existing instance)
