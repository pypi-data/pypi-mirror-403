Purpose
*******

An integrated channel is an abstraction meant to represent a third-party system which provides an API that can be used to transmit EdX data to the third-party system. The most common example of such a third-party system is an enterprise-level learning management system (LMS). LMS users are able to discover content made available by many different content providers and manage the learning outcomes that are produced by interaction with the content providers. In such a scenario, EdX would be the content provider while a system like SAP SuccessFactors would be the integrated channel.


Getting Started with Development
********************************

Please see the Open edX documentation for `guidance on Python development`_ in this repo.

.. _guidance on Python development: https://docs.openedx.org/en/latest/developers/how-tos/get-ready-for-python-dev.html

Running tests locally
*********************

Once inside an LMS Devstack container, you'll want to run unit tests via tox::

  tox

tox will run tests via the ``pytest`` inside a virtual environment. If you want to pass
arguments to ``pytest``, you can pass them after a ``--`` in the command::

  tox -- tests/test_channel_integrations/test_api/test_base_views.py -v

It's necessary to use ``tox`` both because of its use of a python virtual environment (which helps
stay isolated from the edxapp python virtual environment), and because it adds the ``mock_apps/``
directory to the ``PYTHONPATH``.
