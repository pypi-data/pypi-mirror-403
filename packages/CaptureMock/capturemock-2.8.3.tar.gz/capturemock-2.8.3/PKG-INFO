CaptureMock:
        A tool capable of capturing and replaying mock information for the purposes of testing. Supports
        - Python modules and attributes
        - System calls via the command line, including any files they write
        - Synchronous plain-text messaging over a network

        See the documentation at http://www.texttest.org/index.php?page=capturemock

System requirements:

    At least Python 2.6. Tested mainly on Python 3.7 currently.

Installation:

    Go to the "source" directory and run "python setup.py install".
    On Windows, this will probably install to C:\Pythonxx\Scripts, which will then need to be in your PATH if you want to run it from the command line.
