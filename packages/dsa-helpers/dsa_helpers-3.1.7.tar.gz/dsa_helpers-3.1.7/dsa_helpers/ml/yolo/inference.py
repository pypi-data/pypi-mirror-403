    """
    Perform YOLO inference on a whole slide image.

    Args:
        model (str | ultralytics.YOLO): YOLO model or path to the model
            weights.
        wsi_fp (str): File path to the whole slide image.
        mag (float | None, optional): Desired magnification for tiling.
            Note magnification meaning can vary among scanners. We
            convert this to a corresponding resolution defined by a
            standard magnification to resolution ratio (Emory scanner).
            Default is None. Defined by mm_px, or if that is None than
            the scan resolution along the x axis is used.
        mm_px (float | None, optional): Micrometers per pixel for the
            desired resolution. If not provided, will be inferred from
            the mag parameter by standardizing to the Emory scanner. If
            both are not provided, the scan resolution in the x
            direction is used. Default is None.
        tile_size (int, optional): Image is tiled into smaller images,
            tiles, of this size at the desired resolution.
        overlap (int, optional): The number of pixels to overlap between
            tiles. Default is 160.
        batch_size (int, optional): The number of tiles to process in a
            single batch. Used both for the eager iterator and the YOLO
            training. Default is 64.
        prefetch (int, optional): The number of batches to prefetch.
            Used for the eager iterator. Default is 2.
        workers (int, optional): The number of workers to use for
            parallel processing. Used for the eager iterator. Default is
            8.
        chunk_mult (int, optional): The multiplier for the number of tiles
            to process in a single batch. Used for the eager iterator.
            Default is 2.
        agnostic_nms (bool, optional): Whether to use agnostic NMS.
            Default is True.
        conf_thr (float, optional): The confidence threshold for the
            NMS. Default is 0.25.
        iou (float, optional): The IoU threshold for the NMS. Default is
            0.7.
        device (str | None, optional): The device to use for inference.
            Default is None, will use "cuda" if available, otherwise
            "cpu". You can specify values like "cuda:0", "0", or
            multiple devices separated by commas.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the inference results.
            - gdf (geopandas.GeoDataFrame): The inference results as a
              GeoDataFrame.
            - mag (float): The magnification used for inference.
            - mm_px (float): The micrometers per pixel used for inference.
            - time (dict): A dictionary containing the time taken for
              inference.
                - total (float): The total time taken for inference.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If both mag and mm_px are provided.
