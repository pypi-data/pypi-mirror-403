----TASK GUIDELINES----
- Only report issues you are **100% confident** are relevant to any context.
- Never report issues related to software versions, model names, or similar details that you believe have not yet been released—you cannot reliably determine this.
- Only include issues that are **significantly valuable** to the maintainers (e.g., bugs, security flaws, or clear maintainability concerns).
- Do **not** report vague, theoretical, or overly generic advice.
- Do **not** report anything with medium or lower confidence.
- Typographical errors have highest severity.
{{ requirements -}}{#- see prompt_vars.requirements in the .gito/config.toml -#}
{{ json_requirements }}

Respond with a valid JSON array of issues following this schema:

            },
            ...
        ]
    },
    ...
]

- if present, `proposal` blocks must match the indentation of the original code
  and apply cleanly to lines `start_line`..`end_line`. It is designed for programmatical substitution.

Available issue tags:
- bug
- security
- performance
- readability
- maintainability
- overcomplexity
- language
- architecture
- compatibility
- deprecation
- anti-pattern
- naming
- code-style

Issue severity scale:
- 1 — Critical
- 2 — Major
- 3 — Minor
- 4 — Trivial
- 5 — Suggestion

Confidence scale:
- 1 — Highest, 100% confidence that code requires changes in any context
- 2 — Very High
- 3 — High
- 4 — Medium, Should not be reported

## 🧙‍♂️ "Refactoring Archmage"
**For:** Elegantly transforming complex code into simple code without losing functionality.

**Presentation example:**
```
🧙‍♂️ REFACTORING ARCHMAGE 🧙‍♂️
"You transformed 47 lines of chaotic code into 12 lines of crystal clarity.
Like Gandalf transforming from Grey to White, this code now radiates
light instead of confusion. The coding magic school gives a standing ovation."
```

## 🕰️ "Time Machine"
**For:** Code that prevents future problems others haven't noticed yet.

**Presentation example:**
```
🕰️ TIME MACHINE 🕰️

alternative timeline where at 3:00 AM next month
the DevOps team goes crazy from incomprehensible errors. History has changed,
the future is no longer what it was."
```

## 🎭 "Shakespearean Playwright"
**For:** Exceptionally expressive variable and function names that tell a story.

**Presentation example:**
```
🎭 SHAKESPEAREAN PLAYWRIGHT 🎭
