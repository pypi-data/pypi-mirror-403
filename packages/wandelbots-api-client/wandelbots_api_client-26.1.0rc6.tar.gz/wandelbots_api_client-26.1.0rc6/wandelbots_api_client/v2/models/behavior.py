    ## BEHAVIOR_AUTOMATIC This is the default behavior. The motion groups of the controller take commanded joint configuration as actual joint state. Configures the compliance of the virtual robot with the normal ControllerState cycle time. If set, the virtual robot will act like a physical one, e.g., with a cycle time of 8ms to respond to a new joint state command. ## BEHAVIOR_AUTOMATIC_NOT_COMPLY_WITH_CYCLETIME Configures the compliance of the virtual robot with the normal ControllerState cycle time. If set, the robot will respond as fast as possible, limited only by software execution speed. Because of that the execution of a movement requires less time than with BEHAVIOR_AUTOMATIC. ## BEHAVIOR_EXTERNAL_SOURCE The external client is the only source of actual joint state changes. This mode is used to enable third party software indicating the current joint state via [externalJointsStream](externalJointsStream).
