    Defines the current system mode of the robot system, including NOVA communicating with the robot controller.  ### MODE_CONTROLLER_NOT_CONFIGURED  No controller with the specified identifier is configured. Call [addRobotController](addRobotController) to register a controller.  ### MODE_INITIALIZING  Indicates that a connection to the robot controller is established or reestablished in case of a disconnect. On success, the controller is set to MODE_MONITOR. On failure, the initialization process is retried until successful or cancelled by the user.  ### MODE_MONITOR  Read-only mode with an active controller connection. - Receives robot state and I/O signals - Move requests are rejected - No commands are sent to the controller  ### MODE_CONTROL  Active control mode.  **Movement is possible in this mode**  The robot is cyclically commanded to hold its current position. The robot state is received in sync with the controller cycle. Motion and jogging requests are accepted and executed. Input/Output interaction is enabled.  ### MODE_FREE_DRIVE  Read-only mode with servo motors enabled for manual movement (Free Drive).  Move requests are rejected.  Not supported by all robots: Use [getSupportedModes](getSupportedModes) to check Free Drive availability.
