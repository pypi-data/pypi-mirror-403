class DirectionProvider(Component):
    """A DirectionProvider component.
irectionProvider set direction for all components inside it

Keyword arguments:

- children (a list of or a singular dash component, string or number; required):
    Your application.

- id (string; optional):
    Unique ID to identify this component in Dash callbacks.

- direction (a value equal to: 'rtl', 'ltr'; optional):
    Direction `ltr` by default.

- persisted_props (list of strings; optional):
    Properties whose user interactions will persist after refreshing
    the component or the page. Since only `value` is allowed this prop
    can normally be ignored.

- persistence (string | number | boolean; optional):
    Used to allow user interactions in this component to be persisted
    when the component - or the page - is refreshed. If `persisted` is
    truthy and hasn't changed from its previous value, a `value` that
    the user has changed while using the app will keep that change, as
    long as the new `value` also matches what was given originally.
    Used in conjunction with `persistence_type`. Note:  The component
    must have an `id` for persistence to work.

- persistence_type (a value equal to: 'local', 'session', 'memory'; optional):
    Where persisted user changes will be stored: memory: only kept in
    memory, reset on page refresh. local: window.localStorage, data is
    kept after the browser quit. session: window.sessionStorage, data
    is cleared once the browser quit."""
