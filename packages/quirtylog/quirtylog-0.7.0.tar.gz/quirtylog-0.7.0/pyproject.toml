# The addition of the pyproject.toml activates the so-called "build-isolation" mode of pip,
# where each build environment is created ad-hoc and it's isolated from the active virtual
# environment where the package is being installed. This may create unwanted behaviours,
# as the rebuilding of the build dependencies even when they have been already installed previously.
# To prevent this behavior, either remove the pyproject.toml or launch pip the option --no-build-isolation.
