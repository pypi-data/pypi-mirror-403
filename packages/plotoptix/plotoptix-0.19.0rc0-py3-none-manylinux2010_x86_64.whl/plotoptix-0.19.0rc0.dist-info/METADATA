**Data visualisation and ray tracing in Python based on NVIDIA OptiX framework.**

`Documentation <https://plotoptix.rnd.team>`__
----------------------------------------------

- Sample images created with PlotOptiX: `Behance <https://www.behance.net/RnDTeam>`__, `Instagram <https://www.instagram.com/rnd.team.studio/>`__, and `Facebook <https://www.facebook.com/rndteam>`__.

PlotOptiX is a 3D `ray tracing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)>`__ package for Python, aimed at easy and aesthetic visualization
of large datasets (and small as well). Data features can be represented in images as a position, size/thickness and color of primitives
of several basic shapes, or projected onto surfaces of objects in form of a color textures and displacement maps. Triangular meshes,
generated in the code or loaded from a file, are supported as well. All is finished with a photorealistic lighting, depth of field, and many other
physically based effects simulated with a high quality.

No need to write shaders, intersection algorithms, handle 3D scene technicalities. Basic usage is even more simple than with
`matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/gallery/mplot3d/scatter3d.html>`__:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from plotoptix import TkOptiX

   n = 1000000                                  # 1M points, better not try this with matplotlib
   xyz = 3 * (np.random.random((n, 3)) - 0.5)   # random 3D positions
   r = 0.02 * np.random.random(n) + 0.002       # random radii

   plot = TkOptiX()
   plot.set_data("my plot", xyz, r=r)
   plot.show()

... but PlotOptiX is much faster on large data, and, with all the raytraced shades and DoF, more readable and eye catching.

Check `examples on GitHub <https://github.com/rnd-team-dev/plotoptix/tree/master/examples>`__ for practical code samples and `documentation pages <https://plotoptix.rnd.team>`__ for a complete API reference.

PlotOptiX is a set of CUDA shaders by `R&D Team <https://rnd.team>`_ wrapped in C#/C++ libraries with a Python API. It is based on `NVIDIA OptiX 9.0 <https://developer.nvidia.com/optix>`_ framework and makes use of RTX-capable GPU's.

You can quickly display data in a simple plot:

or prepare complex scenes, combining your generated data with meshes modeled elsewhere:

System Requirements
-------------------

- a `CUDA-enabled GPU <https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus>`__ with compute capability >= 5.0;
   - NVIDIA driver >= r570;
- **Python 3 64-bit**
- Windows:
   - `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html>`__ >= 7.0
- Linux:
   - `Mono <https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin>`__ Common Language Runtime >= 6.6
   - `pythonnet <http://pythonnet.github.io>`__
   - `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html>`__ >= 7.0

What's Included
---------------

- RnD.SharpOptiX and RnD.SharpEncoder libraries
- supporting 3'rd party libraries: LibTiff, Newtonsoft.Json
- Python examples

Installation
============

**Note**, at this point, PlotOptiX binaries are tested in: Windows 10/11 (any Python 3), and Linux (Python 3.8-3.10 recommended): Ubuntu 22.04, CentOS 7.

PlotOptiX was also successfully tested on the `Google Cloud Platform <https://cloud.google.com/>`__, using Compute Engine instance with 2x V100 GPU's and Ubuntu 18.04 image.
Here are the `installation steps <https://github.com/rnd-team-dev/plotoptix/blob/master/gcp_install_gpu.txt>`__ so you can save some precious seconds (FFmpeg not included).

If you'd like to work on Colab, it is possible as well. `Here is a notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RSVKYSZl1NjfttBwyuoehaEkNWnXwy6t?usp=sharing>`__ with
all the setup and a simple image generated with PlotOptiX. *Note*: Colab drivers usually are not up to date and the most recent PlotOptiX release may not be compatible with what
Colab provides. The sample notebook is configured to install release wich works with the available driver.

Windows should be ready to go in most cases. You need to do some more typing in Linux.

Windows prerequisites
---------------------

*FFmpeg:*

FFmpeg shared libraries >= 7.0 are required to enable video encoding features (ffmpeg 8.0 recommended). Visit `FFmpeg site <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html>`__ and
go to the site with pre-built Windows binaries. Download the *full-shared* package. Unpack it to a new folder. You'll need to add path to dll files (the `bin` folder, which
contains exe's and dll's) to your `PATH` environment variable.

Linux prerequisites
-------------------

*NVIDIA driver*

It is recommended to update to the most recent release. Check instructions for your linux distribution. E.g. in Ubuntu::

   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
   sudo apt install nvidia-driver-XXX
   sudo reboot

*Mono runtime:*

Check if / which Mono release is present in your system::

   mono -V
   
   Mono JIT compiler version 5.18.1.3 (tarball Tue Apr  9 16:16:30 UTC 2019)
      Copyright (C) 2002-2014 Novell, Inc, Xamarin Inc and Contributors. www.mono-project.com
	   TLS:           __thread
      ... (output cropped for clarity) ...

If ``mono`` command is not available, or the reported version is < 6.6, visit `Mono download page <https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin>`__ and follow instructions related to your Linux distribution. You want to install **mono-complete** package.

*pythonnet:*

The `pythonnet <http://pythonnet.github.io>`__ package is available from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pythonnet>`__, however, you might need some prerequisities. Instuctions below are based on APT, replace ``apt`` with ``yum`` depending on your OS::

   apt update
   apt install clang libglib2.0-dev python-dev
   
You may also need to install development tools, if not already present in your system, e.g. in Ubuntu::

   apt install build-essential
   
or in CentOS::

   yum group install "Development Tools" 
   
Then, update required packages and install ``pythonnet``::

   pip install -U setuptools wheel pycparser
   pip install -U pythonnet
   
After successful installation you should be able to do python's import:

.. code-block:: python

   import clr
   print(clr.__version__)

*FFmpeg:*

FFmpeg shared libraries >= 7.0 are required to enable video encoding features (ffmpeg 8.0 recommended). Uninstall older version first.
Visit `FFmpeg site <https://ffmpeg.org/download.html>`__ and download the most recent release sources. Unpack it to a new folder, cd to it.
Configure, compile and install as below::

   ./configure --enable-shared
   make
   sudo make install

Add FFmpeg's shared library path to your config::

   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
   sudo ldconfig

PlotOptiX
---------

Using pip::

   pip install -U plotoptix

From GitHub sources::

   git clone https://github.com/rnd-team-dev/plotoptix.git
   cd plotoptix
   python setup.py install

Then, try running code from the top of this readme, or one of the examples. You may also need to install ``tkinter`` and/or ``PyQt`` packages, if not shipped with your Python environment.

Development path
================

This is still an experimental version in many aspects.

PlotOptiX is basically an interface to RnD.SharpOptiX library which we are developing and using in our Studio. RnD.SharpOptiX offers
much more functionality than it is now available through PlotOptiX. We progressively add more to PlotOptiX based mostly on the interest
of our patrons and applications that this project supports.

we are always happy to help and take part in exciting ideas of our users.

Examples
========

Looking at examples is the best way to get started and explore PlotOptiX features. Have a look at the
`readme and sample codes here <https://github.com/rnd-team-dev/plotoptix/tree/master/examples>`__.

Examples in the repository head may use features not yet available in the PyPI release. In order to download examples
compatible with PyPI release install the package::

	python -m plotoptix.install examples

This will create a folder with examples in the current directory.
