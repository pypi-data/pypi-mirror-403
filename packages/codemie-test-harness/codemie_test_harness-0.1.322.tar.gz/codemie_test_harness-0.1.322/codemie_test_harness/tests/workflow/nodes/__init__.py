"""Workflow nodes test package.

This package contains tests for workflow node functionality and state transitions:
- Iterative transitions (map-reduce patterns)
- Conditional transitions
- Parallel transitions
- Simple transitions

These tests verify the behavior of different workflow transition types and
how data flows through various node configurations.
