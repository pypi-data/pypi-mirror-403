"""Context management test package.

This package contains tests for workflow context management features:
- store_in_context: Controls whether state output is stored in context store (default: true)
- include_in_llm_history: Controls whether state output appears in LLM message history (default: true)
- clear_prior_messages: Clears all prior messages from message history (default: false)
- clear_context_store: Controls context store clearing (false | true | "keep_current", default: false)

These features control how data flows between workflow states, what information
is available to LLM assistants, and when to reset context between workflow phases.
