            Notification Tools: Tools for sending notifications and alerts via email, chat, or other communication channels.
            
            Data Management Tools: Tools for querying Elasticsearch indexes.
            
            Git
            
            Access Management: Keycloak
            
            Plugin
            
            Open API
            
            Notification
            
            File Management
            
            Data Management
            
            Quality Assurance
            
            There is no priority or sequential system in place. Everything depends on the given instructions. It is possible to instruct the model to use a specific data source for a particular use case or provide a description for the data source when it is created. Data source descriptions are provided to the model so it can understand better use cases for it.
            
            The data source does not have rules, only description. System Instructions(System prompt) extends based on data source description. If contradictions arise, the model will use its creative problem-solving abilities to address them. 
            
            The model has a context window, but it is irrelevant to data source size. The model answer will depend on query quality. There is a use case when the model has thousands of data sources, however with queries that are specific and on point there are no problems. If a poor query provided e.g., “tell me about something” answer would be vague.
            
            Other than the context window there is no limit, however there is a simple rule: the smaller and clearer the instructions, the better. Also, the instructions must be uncontradictory, as this will reduce the risk of confusing LLM.
