The top pain for users of Claude Code and similar CLI agents is...

Session Continuity: When do you do when fill up the context window?

You can "compact" -- but this leaves your session with just a summary of your current task and you lose valuable detail that you likely have to explain/generate all over again.

Instead, I use "aichat" tool in my claude-code-tools repo and continue my work:

I quit the session, and run this command: `aichat resume <session-id>` 

This launches a TUI offering a few ways to continue my work:

* Trim: clones the session and truncate long tool calls/results and older assistant messages -- this can bring context usage to as low as 50%.

* Rollover: creates a new session and inject the session log file path into the first user message. Then I can prompt Claude Code to use a sub-agent to recover any context
I need, directly from the original session log file. I can now continue my work with 
under 15-20% of context.

In the repo, there is a plugin containing hooks, agents, skills, and slash commands that make this "session continuity" even more seamless. 

The tool is dead-simple to use -- there is no elaborate "memory" mechanism, nor do you have to follow any particular protocol or system. 

The aichat tool is just one of several productivity tools in the claude-code-tools repo:
If you'd like to try them out, see the repo for instructions on how to install the suite of tools.
