# Recipes

**Copy-paste solutions for common patterns.**

Recipes are complete, working examples you can adapt for your use case. Unlike Guides (which explain how things work), Recipes give you code you can drop into your project immediately.

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    Recipes are being written. In the meantime, check out the [Guides](../guides/index.md) for detailed explanations of each feature, or see the [examples in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/benavlabs/fastroai/tree/main/examples).

    We're working on recipes for common patterns like document processing, parallel research, conversation bots, and cost budget enforcement.

## What Makes a Good Recipe

Each recipe includes:

| Section | What It Contains |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Problem** | What you're trying to solve |
| **Solution** | Complete, runnable code |
| **How It Works** | Brief explanation of key parts |
| **Variations** | Common modifications |

Recipes assume you've read the [Quick Start](../index.md#quick-start) and understand FastroAgent basics.
