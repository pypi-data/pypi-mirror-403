           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

**Documentation**: https://github.com/Dhiraj309/text-curation  
**Source Code**: https://github.com/Dhiraj309/text-curation

---

## Overview

**text-curation** is a Python library for building **structured, profile-driven text curation pipelines**
designed for **large-scale NLP datasets**, with first-class integration into the
**Hugging Face Datasets** ecosystem.

It focuses on **deterministic, inspectable, and conservative text transformations**
for preparing corpora used in LLM training, evaluation, and analysis.

Rather than relying on ad-hoc cleanup scripts, `text-curation` promotes
**explicit, versioned curation profiles** that make data preprocessing
**reproducible, auditable, and stable over time**.

---

## Design Principles

- **Profile-driven pipelines**  
  Reusable, declarative profiles define how text is curated for a given domain
  (e.g. web, wiki, forums).

- **Composable blocks**  
  Each transformation is implemented as an isolated block with a single,
  explicit responsibility.

- **Deterministic and conservative**  
  All transformations are rule-based and non-destructive by default,
  prioritizing semantic preservation.

- **Structure-aware processing**  
  Text is treated as structured content (paragraphs, lists, headers),
  not just raw strings.

- **Dataset-scale friendly**  
  Designed to run efficiently on large Hugging Face Datasets using `.map`.

---

## Scope & Stability (v1.3.4)

As of **v1.3.4**, `text-curation` provides a **stable and extensible core**
for structure-aware text curation of real-world, messy data.

The default behavior and semantics of the core blocks and built-in profiles
are considered **stable** and will not change without a major version bump.

Stability is enforced through **block-level unit tests and golden profile tests**,
which act as executable specifications.

The library intentionally focuses on **deterministic preprocessing**
rather than semantic classification or machine-learning-based filtering.

---

## Core Blocks (Stable)

The following blocks are part of the **stable core** in v1.3.4.

- **Normalization**  
  Canonicalizes Unicode and typography (quotes, dashes, ellipses),
  removes control and zero-width characters, and normalizes whitespace.

- **Formatting**  
  Reconstructs paragraph structure, normalizes punctuation spacing,
  and preserves indentation-sensitive content such as code blocks.
  Paragraph semantics are preserved by design.

- **Redaction**  
  Masks sensitive content such as emails, API tokens, and embedded credentials
  using explicit, non-destructive placeholders.

- **Structure**  
  Detects headers, lists, repetition, and boilerplate indicators,
  emitting inspectable signals without mutating text.

- **Filtering**  
  Applies conservative, signal-based removal of empty or low-value paragraphs.

- **Deduplication**  
  Performs exact, paragraph-level deduplication using normalization-safe keys.

More aggressive semantic filtering, fuzzy deduplication, or heuristic cleanup
are intentionally **not enabled by default** and may be introduced only via
explicit opt-in profiles in future releases.

---

## Non-Goals

`text-curation` intentionally does **not** attempt to:

- Perform semantic or topical classification
- Use machine learning or probabilistic heuristics
- Infer document quality or intent
- Preserve exact visual formatting of source text
- Aggressively remove all boilerplate or repetition by default

These constraints are **by design** and are critical to ensuring
predictable, reproducible dataset preprocessing.

---

## Installation

`text-curation` supports **Python ≥ 3.9**.

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install text-curation
````

Or install from source for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhiraj309/text-curation.git
cd text-curation
pip install -e .
```

---

## Quickstart

### Curating a Hugging Face Dataset

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from text_curation import TextCurator

dataset = load_dataset(
    "HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu",
    split="train",
)

curator = TextCurator.from_profile("web_common:v1")

cleaned = dataset.map(
    curator,
    batched=True,
    num_proc=4,
)
```

The curator is a **pure function**:
it takes a batch dictionary and returns a dictionary with the same schema,
making it fully compatible with Hugging Face Datasets.

---

## Profiles

Profiles define **which blocks are applied and in what order**.

Profiles are:

* Explicitly versioned
* Registered at import time
* Resolved via a global registry

Conceptual example:

```python
web_common_v1 = [
    RedactionBlock(),
    NormalizationBlock(),
    CodeSafeFormattingBlock(),
    ParagraphFormattingBlock(),
    BasicStructureBlock(),
    ExactParagraphDeduplicationBlock(),
]
```

Profiles are referenced using explicit version identifiers
(e.g. `web_common:v1`) to ensure **long-term reproducibility and auditability**.

Profiles may be deprecated, but are never silently changed.

---

## Designed For

* Web-scale datasets (C4-like, Common Crawl, scraped corpora)
* OCR- and PDF-derived text
* Forums, blogs, and user-generated content
* Dataset preprocessing prior to LLM training or evaluation

The library is intentionally **model-agnostic** and does not depend on
tokenizers, embeddings, or classifiers.

---

## Why text-curation?

* Cleaning text is not just normalization — **structure and repetition matter**
* Ad-hoc scripts do not scale or reproduce
* Dataset curation deserves the same rigor as model training
* Explicit pipelines make data decisions inspectable and debuggable

`text-curation` is designed to be the **data-side analogue**
of model-definition libraries in the Hugging Face ecosystem.

---

## When should you *not* use text-curation?

* If you only need a one-off regex cleanup
* If your data is already fully curated
* If you require ML-based content classification or scoring

---

## Versioning & Compatibility

This project follows **semantic versioning**.

* `1.x` releases guarantee stable default behavior
* Breaking changes require a major version bump
* Profiles are versioned independently of library versions
  to preserve long-term reproducibility

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

When adding new blocks or profiles:

* Keep transformations deterministic
* Avoid destructive defaults
* Include clear before/after examples
* Add or update tests to lock in behavior
