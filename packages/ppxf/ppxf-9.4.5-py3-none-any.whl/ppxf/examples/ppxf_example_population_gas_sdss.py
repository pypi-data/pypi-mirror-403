# # pPXF: Stellar population and gas emission lines

# [<img src="https://users.physics.ox.ac.uk/~cappellari/images/ppxf-logo.svg" width="100">](https://users.physics.ox.ac.uk/~cappellari/software/#sec:ppxf)
#
# ## Description
#
# Usage example for the procedure pPXF originally described in 
# [Cappellari & Emsellem (2004)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PASP..116..138C),
# substantially upgraded in 
# [Cappellari (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466..798C) 
# and with the inclusion of photometry and linear constraints in 
# [Cappellari (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.3273C).
#
# This example shows how to study stellar population and include gas emission
# lines as templates instead of masking them using the `goodpiixels` keyword.
#

# should use the relevant software/website to produce different sets of SPS
# templates if needed.
