#
# Usage example for the procedure pPXF originally described in 
# [Cappellari & Emsellem (2004)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PASP..116..138C),
# substantially upgraded in 
# [Cappellari (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466..798C) 
# and with the inclusion of photometry and linear constraints in 
# [Cappellari (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.3273C).

# ## Setup stellar templates 
#
# pPXF can be used with any set of SPS population templates. However, I am
# currently providing (with permission) ready-to-use template files for four
# SPS. One can just uncomment one of the four models below. The included files
# are only a subset of the SPS that can be produced with the models, and one
# should use the relevant software/website to produce different sets of SPS
# templates if needed.
#
# 1. If you use the [fsps v3.2](https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps) SPS model
#    templates, please also cite in your paper 
#    [Conroy et al. (2009)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...699..486C) and
#    [Conroy et al. (2010)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...712..833C).
#
# 2. If you use the [GALAXEV v2020](http://www.bruzual.org/bc03/) SPS model 
#    templates, please also cite in your paper 
#    [Bruzual & Charlot (2003)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.344.1000B).
#
# 3. If you use the [E-MILES](http://miles.iac.es/) SPS model templates,
#    please also cite  in your paper 
#    [Vazdekis et al. (2016)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.463.3409V).
#    <span style="color:darkorange">WARNING: The E-MILES models only include SPS with age > 63 Myr and
#    are not recommended for highly star forming galaxies.</span>
#
# 4. If you use the [X-Shooter Spectral Library (XSL)](http://xsl.u-strasbg.fr/) 
#    SPS model templates, please also cite in your paper 
#    [Verro et al. (2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...661A..50V).
