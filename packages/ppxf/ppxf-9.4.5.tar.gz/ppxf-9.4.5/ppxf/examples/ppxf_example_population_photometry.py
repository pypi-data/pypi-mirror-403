#
# ## Description
#
# Usage example for the procedure pPXF originally described in 
# [Cappellari & Emsellem (2004)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PASP..116..138C),
# substantially upgraded in 
# [Cappellari (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466..798C) 
# and with the inclusion of photometry and linear constraints in 
# [Cappellari (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.3273C).
#

# templates if needed.
