# [<img src="https://users.physics.ox.ac.uk/~cappellari/images/ppxf-logo.svg" width="100">](https://users.physics.ox.ac.uk/~cappellari/software/#sec:ppxf)
#
# ## Description
#
# Usage example for the procedure pPXF originally described in 
# [Cappellari & Emsellem (2004)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PASP..116..138C),
# substantially upgraded in 
# [Cappellari (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466..798C) 
# and with the inclusion of photometry and linear constraints in 
# [Cappellari (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.3273C).
#
# This example shows how to tie the kinematics of gas emission lines to study
# stellar population and gas emission lines.
#
# ### MODIFICATION HISTORY

#       for the difference in starting wavelength of galaxy and templates.
#       MC, Vicenza, 28 December 2004
# - V1.1.1: Included explanation of correction for instrumental resolution.
#       After feedback from David Valls-Gabaud. MC, Venezia, 27 June 2005

#       MC, Oxford, 14 April 2009
# - V2.1.0: Bug fix: Force PSF_GAUSSIAN to produce a Gaussian with an odd
#       number of elements centered on the middle one. Many thanks to
#       Harald Kuntschner, Eric Emsellem, Anne-pMarie Weijmans and
#       Richard McDermid for reporting problems with small offsets
#       in systemic velocity. MC, Oxford, 15 February 2010

# - V2.2.2: Renamed PPXF_KINEMATICS_EXAMPLE_SAURON to avoid conflict with the
#       new PPXF_KINEMATICS_EXAMPLE_SDSS. Removed DETERMINE_GOOPIXELS which was
#       made a separate routine. MC, Oxford, 12 January 2012
# - V3.0.0: Translated from IDL into Python. MC, Oxford, 6 December 2013
# - V3.0.1: Support both Python 2.6/2.7 and Python 3.x. MC, Oxford, 25 May 2014

#       Thanks to Kyle Westfall for finding this issue in the MaNGA DAP.

# - V3.1.4: Updated text on the de-redshifting of the spectrum.
#       MC, Oxford, 5 October 2017
# - V3.1.5: Changed imports for pPXF as a package.

#       example unchanged from any directory. MC, Oxford, 17 April 2018
# - V3.1.6: Dropped legacy Python 2.7 support. MC, Oxford, 10 May 2018

#       MC, Oxford, 27 September 2018
