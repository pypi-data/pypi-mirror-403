#
# ## Description
#
# Usage example for the procedure pPXF originally described in 
# [Cappellari & Emsellem (2004)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PASP..116..138C),
# substantially upgraded in 
# [Cappellari (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466..798C) 
# and with the inclusion of photometry and linear constraints in 
# [Cappellari (2023)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.3273C).
#
# This example shows how to tie the kinematics of gas emission lines to study
# stellar population and gas emission lines.
#

#       spectral library. MC, Vicenza, 11 October 2012
#  - V1.1.1: Includes `regul_error` definition. MC, Oxford, 15 November 2012
#  - V2.0.0: Translated from IDL into Python. MC, Oxford, 6 December 2013
#  - V2.0.1: Fit SDSS rather than SAURON spectrum. MC, Oxford, 11 December 2013

#  - V2.1.2: Illustrates how to print and plot emission lines.
#       MC, Oxford, 5 August 2014
#  - V2.1.3: Only includes emission lines falling within the fitted wavelength
#       range. MC, Oxford, 3 September 2014
#  - V2.1.4: Explicitly sort template files as `glob()` output may not be sorted.
#       Thanks to Marina Trevisan for reporting problems under Linux.
#       MC, Sydney, 4 February 2015

#       using the new `miles` class which leaves no room for user mistakes.
#       MC, Oxford, 2 December 2016
#  - V3.0.1: Make files paths relative to this file, to run the example from
#       any directory. MC, Oxford, 18 January 2017

# In addition, I set the *inequality* constrain that the sigma of the gas lines
# must be smaller than 2x the stellar sigma. This is to prevent nearly-undetected
# gas lines, which are unconstrained by the data, to become unrealistically broad
# and mimic the effect of a smooth stellar continuum. For this, I set the
# constraint that the velocity dispersion of the gas `component=1--8` must be
# less than twice the sigma of the stars `component=0`. In formulas, I want to
# have:
#
# $$
# \begin{cases}
#   \sigma_1 < 2\sigma_0\\
#   \sigma_2 < 2\sigma_0\\
#   \vdots\\
#   \sigma_8 < 2\sigma_0
# \end{cases}
# $$
#
# Following standard practice in numerical optimization (e.g.
# [HERE](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/optim/ug/linear-constraints.html)), I
# express these two inequalities as linear constraints in matrix form as this
# leads to an efficient optimization algorithm, with guaranteed local
# convergence:
#
# $$\mathbf{A}_{\rm ineq}\cdot \mathbf{p} < \mathbf{b}_{\rm ineq}.$$
#
# In this example, the vector of nonlinear kinematic parameters is
# $\mathbf{p}=[V_0, \sigma_0, V_1, \sigma_1, \ldots V_8, \sigma_8]$
# (following the same order of the `start` parameter of `pPXF`) and I can write
# the above matrix equation explicitly as
#
# $$
# \begin{bmatrix}
#   0 & -2 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \ldots & 0\\
