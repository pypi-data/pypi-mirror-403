This ``pPXF`` package contains a Python implementation of the Penalized
PiXel-Fitting (``pPXF``) method. It uses full-spectrum fitting with photometry
(SED) to extract the stellar and gas kinematics, as well as the stellar population of
stars and galaxies. The method was originally described in `Cappellari & Emsellem (2004)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004PASP..116..138C>`_
and was substantially upgraded in subsequent years and particularly in
`Cappellari (2017) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.466..798C>`_
and with the inclusion of photometry and linear constraints in
`Cappellari (2023) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.3273C>`_.

Installation
------------

install with::

    pip install ppxf

Without write access to the global ``site-packages`` directory, use::

    pip install --user ppxf

To upgrade ``pPXF`` to the latest version use::

    pip install --upgrade ppxf

Usage Examples
--------------

To learn how to use the ``pPXF`` package, copy, modify and run
the example programs in the ``ppxf/examples`` directory. 
It can be found within the main ``ppxf`` package installation folder 
inside `site-packages <https://stackoverflow.com/a/46071447>`_. 
The detailed documentation is contained in the docstring of the file 
``ppxf.py``, or on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/ppxf/>`_ or as PDF 
from `<https://purl.org/cappellari/software>`_.
