Changelog
---------

V9.4.5: MC, Oxford, 26 January 2026
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: Generalized regularization to support arbitrary number of dimensions.
- ``ppxf``: Added ``resid_offset`` and ``plot_scale`` keywords to ``.plot()`` 
  to control the residuals offset and overall scale of the plotting symbols.
- Updated examples to use ``PowerBin`` instead of ``VorBin`` for spatial
  binning of IFU data, following the deprecation of ``VorBin``.

V9.4.2: MC, Oxford, 12 March 2025
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: Added a new boolean keyword ``fit`` to skip the fit and only
  initialize the class. When ``fit=False``, the ``pp.linear_fit`` method also
  skips the linear fit, only setting the ``pp.bestfit`` attribute and returning
  the residuals. In this scenario, the user must define all class parameters
  and attributes manually.

V9.4.1: MC, Oxford, 05 August 2024
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Removed ``capfit`` from the ``pPXF`` package and made it a separate package.
- ``sps_util.sps_lib``: Renamed ``wave_range`` to ``lam_range`` for consistency
  with other procedures in the ``pPXF`` package.
- ``ppxf_util.emission_lines``: Allow for ``FWHM_gal`` to be a dictionary, to
  be consistent with ``sps_util.sps_lib``.
- Removed the NGC4636 spectrum from the examples and updated the other spectra
  to the latest SDSS data release, which includes the instrumental dispersion
  per pixel. Illustrated how to deal with a variable instrumental dispersion in
  the examples.

V9.3.0: MC, Oxford, 28 June 2024
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Converted all ``pPXF`` Python examples to ``py:percent`` format, which allows
  one to open them as Jupyter Notebooks in most Python IDEs. Also added
  several of my public Jupyter Notebook examples as ``py:percent`` Python files
  in the ``ppxf/examples`` folder.
- Updated examples and associated documentation to demonstrate the use of the
  X-Shooter Stellar Library (XSL) SPS models (Verro+2022) with ``pPXF``.
  The XSL template spectra can now be automatically retrieved from GitHub by
  specifying ``sps_name = 'xsl'`` within the examples code.
- ``sps_util.synthetic_photometry``: Swapped order of input parameters from
  ``(spectrum, lam)`` to ``(lam, spectrum)`` for consistency with other
  ``pPXF`` procedures. Updated corresponding examples.
- ``sps_util.sps_lib``: Removed the warning regarding the template having a
  lower resolution than the galaxy. This is because it could lead to false
  positives, considering that the galaxy's fitted spectral range is not
  generally known during template generation.

V9.2.2: MC, Oxford, 20 May 2024
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: Fixed an issue where the absence of the ``reg_dim`` keyword could
  halt the program (bug from V9.2.1). Thanks to Jesse van de Sande
  (unsw.edu.au) and Luiz A. Silva-Lima (Univ. Sao Paulo, Brazil) for the
  report.

- ``ppxf``: Avoid possible program stop when ``templates`` are shorter than
  ``galaxy`` (bug from V9.2.1).

- ``ppxf``: Avoid truncating ``templates`` to ``goodpixels`` in the final plot,
  when both ``lam`` and ``lam_temp`` parameters are supplied. Instead, show the
  ``templates`` over the full ``galaxy`` spectral range.
  
- ``ppxf``: Corrected behaviour to only use the range between the first and
  last ``goodpixels`` for determining the vertical plotting range.  Thanks to
  David Gooding (chch.ox.ac.uk) for illustrating the problem.

- ``ppxf_example_kinematics_sdss.py``: Modified the example to de-redshift the
  spectrum by default, minimizing potential confusion.

V9.2.1: MC, Oxford, 18 April 2024
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``sps_util.synthetic_photometry``: Accepts input wavelengths that are not
  evenly spaced.
- ``ppxf_util.mag_spectrum``: A new function to get the apparent magnitude from
  a spectrum in any photometric band, at any redshift, in either the AB or Vega
  magnitude system.
- ``ppxf``: Now considers the given ``goodpixels`` when checking that the
  ``templates`` cover the full ``galaxy`` spectrum, if both ``lam`` and
  ``lam_temp`` are provided.
- ``ppxf``: Allow for variable step size across intervals and dimensions in the
  numerical derivatives used for regularization, with the new keyword
  ``reg_step``.
- ``ppxf``: Avoids new ``SyntaxWarning`` in Matplotlib LaTeX string in the
  latest Python 3.12.
- ``ppxf``: Avoid program stop when passing an input covariance matrix while
  fitting for gas emission lines. Thanks to Jackson ODonnell (ucsc.edu) for the
  report.

V9.1.1: MC, Oxford, 18 January 2024
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``sps_util.mass_to_light``: Now it can calculate the stellar mass-to-light
  ratio (``M*/L``) for any stellar population synthesis (SPS) model, any
  filter, and any redshift, using the output weights from ``pPXF``. No need for
  pre-computed tables anymore.
- ``ppxf_util.mag_sun``: A new function to get the absolute solar magnitude in
  any photometric band, at any redshift, in either the AB or Vega magnitude
  system.

V9.0.2: MC, Oxford, 30 November 2023
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: Fixed bug in the automatic truncation of the template wavelength,
  when using ``bounds`` together with ``lam`` and ``lam_temp``.

V9.0.1: MC, Oxford, 12 November 2023
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Replaced ``miles_util`` with ``sps_util``, a versatile and flexible function
  that supports various stellar population synthesis (SPS) models. Currently, I
  distribute (with permission) the ``E-MILES`` (Vazdekis+2016), ``GALAXEV``
  (Bruzual & Charlot 2003) and ``fsps`` (Conroy+2009,2010) stellar population
  templates. One can now change SPS by just modifying the filename.
  
  IMPORTANT: I no longer include the SPS models in the ``pPXF`` package, due to
  file size constraints. One must download the SPS templates separately after
  the ``pPXF`` installation, as demonstrated in all the ``pPXF`` examples.
- I adapted all examples included in the package to use the new ``sps_util``. 
- ``ppxf.plot``: New keyword ``lam_flam`` to plot ``lam*f(lam) = nu*f(nu)``.
- ``ppxf_util.synthetic_photometry``: Converted from a function to a class.
  Added ``.lam_piv`` attribute to compute the pivot wavelength of each filter.
- ``ppxf_util.varsmooth``: Specialized faster convolution if sigma is a scalar
  while using the analytic Fourier transform to deal with undersampling.
- ``ppxf``: Raised an error if ``phot`` input is not finite.

V8.2.6: MC, Oxford, 6 July 2023
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``capfit``: Relaxed tolerance when checking initial guess feasibility.
- ``ppxf_util``: Fixed program stop in ``gaussian_filter1d`` when ``sig=0``.
  Thanks to Jesse Van de Sande (sydney.edu.au) for the report.

V8.2.4: MC, Oxford, 12 May 2023
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: Fixed incorrectly switching to ``method='linear'`` when requesting
  to fit stellar reddening alone, while all other parameters are fixed. Thanks
  to Jong Chul Lee (kasi.re.kr) for a clear example of reproducing the bug.

V8.2.3: MC, Oxford, 5 January 2023
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: Fixed program stop when fitting both sky spectra and gas emission
  lines. Many thanks to Adarsh Ranjan (kasi.re.kr) for a clear example
  of reproducing the problem and for the bug fix.
- ``ppxf``: Raise an error if ``velscale`` is not a scalar. Updated example
  procedures. This fixes a program stop due to a change in NumPy 1.24.
- ``ppxf_util``: Changed ``log_rebin`` to return ``velscale`` as a scalar.
- New example procedure ``ppxf_example_gas_sdss_tied.py`` to illustrate the
  use of the ``tied`` and ``constr_kinem`` keywords.

V8.2.2: MC, Oxford, 11 October 2022
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: Fixed program stop with ``tied`` or ``fixed`` keywords and
  nonlinear variables in addition to the kinematics. Thanks to Tobias Looser
  (cam.ac.uk) for the report and fix.

V8.2.1: MC, Oxford, 3 September 2022
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: New keyword ``dust`` which allows one to associate different
  general attenuation functions to different sets of templates. This is useful
  for example to apply three different attenuation functions to the young and
  old stellar templates and to the gas emission lines respectively.
- ``ppxf``: Uses ``A_V`` instead of ``E(B-V)`` to parametrize attenuation, when
  using the now-obsolete keywords ``reddening`` and  ``gas_reddening``.
- ``ppxf``: New default function ``attenuation()``. However, one can now use
  general attenuation functions with an arbitrary number of bound or fixed
  parameters.
- ``ppxf``: New internal functions ``set_lam_input``, ``set_gas_input``,
  ``set_dust_input``, ``set_phot_input`` to organize the code.
- ``ppxf``: Improved vertical scaling of default plots.
- ``ppxf``: New keywords ``pp.plot(spec=True, phot=True)`` to plot only the
  photometric or spectroscopic best fits respectively.
- ``ppxf_util``: New function ``varsmooth`` for Gaussian convolution with a
  variable sigma. Unlike the similar ``gaussian_filter1d``, this new function
  uses FFT and the analytic Fourier Transform of a Gaussian, like ``ppxf``.
- ``ppxf_util``: Included additional gas emission lines in ``emission_lines()``.
- ``capfit``: Use ``scipy.optimize.linprog(method='highs')`` to find feasible
  starting point in ``lsq_lin``. This eliminates possible program stops in
  certain situations with linearly dependent constraints.
- ``capfit``: Set default ``linear_method='lsq_lin'``. This removes the need
  to install ``cvxopt`` when using ``constr_kinem`` in ``pPXF``.

V8.1.0: MC, Oxford, 10 June 2022
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: More accurate determination of the range for truncating the
  templates when passing both ``lam_temp`` and ``lam``.
- ``ppxf``: Check for ``lam`` or ``lam_temp`` consistency with ``velscale`` and
  return an error if they do not match.
- ``ppxf``: Use micrometre units and denser tick labels for the logarithmic
  wavelength axis.
- ``ppxf_util.synthetic_photometry``: moved from ``miles_util`` and made it
  independent of the stellar library. Adopted the same filter file format as
  EAZY, FAST, HyperZ... for interoperability.
  Allow passing a file with user-defined filter response functions.
- ``ppxf_util.log_rebin``: Support irregularly sampled input wavelength.
- ``ppxf_util.gaussian_filter1d``: New keyword ``mode='constant'`` or
  ``mode='wrap'``.
- Updated ``ppxf_example_population_photometry.py``

V8.0.2: MC, Oxford, 28 March 2022
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: Allow fitting photometric measurements (SED fitting) together with
  a spectrum. This is implemented via the new keyword ``phot`` passing a
  dictionary of parameters.
- ``ppxf``: plot photometric fit together with spectrum when fitting
  photometry.
- ``ppxf``: New keyword ``lam_temp`` to input the templates wavelength. When
  this is given, together with the galaxy wavelength ``lam``, the templates are
  automatically truncated to an optimal wavelength range, and it becomes
  unnecessary to use the keyword ``vsyst``.
- ``ppxf``: Warning if ``templates`` are ``> 2x`` longer than ``galaxy``.
- ``ppxf``: When fitting photometry one can input extended template spectra to
  overplot the extrapolated best-fit spectrum together with the photometry.
- New demo file on photometric fitting
  ``ppxf_example_population_photometry.py``.
- ``miles_util.photometry_from_table``: New example function to illustrate the
  generation of the input photometric templates for the ``phot`` keyword, using
  tabulated SSP model magnitudes.
- ``miles_util.photometry_from_spectra``: New example function to illustrate
  the generation of photometric templates from the spectra using filter
  responses.
- Replaced MILES spectral models of Vazdekis et al. (2010) with E-MILES models
  of Vazdekis et al. (2016). Thanks to Alexandre Vazdekis (iac.es) for the
  permission.
- Adapted all ``pPXF`` examples to use the E-MILES templates.
- ``miles_util.miles``: changed names of output wavelength ``.ln_lam_temp`` to
  make clear they represent natural logarithms.
- ``miles_util.miles``: set ``FWHM_gal=None`` to skip templates convolution.
- ``ppxf``: Optionally performs global optimization of the non-linear
  parameters. This is implemented via the new keyword ``global_search``.
- ``ppxf``: Allow the use of multiplicative polynomials together with
  reddening.
- ``ppxf``: Plot individual gas emission components in addition to their sum.
- ``ppxf``: Updated docstring documentation for the new features.
- ``capfit``: Completely removed tied/fixed variables from the optimization and
  constraints. This improves the conditioning of the Jacobian and further
  strengthens the robustness of the optimization.
- ``miles_util``: fixed ``flux`` array mismatch when using ``age_range`` or
  ``metal_range``. Thanks to Davide Bevacqua (inaf.it) for the report.
- ``ppxf``: Fixed program stop when fitting gas with a template length that is
  not a multiple of ``velscale_ratio``.

V7.4.5: MC, Oxford, 16 July 2021
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: New keyword ``pp.plot(clip_gas=True)`` to ignore the gas emission
  lines while determining the plotting ranges for the best-fitting model.

V7.4.4: MC, Oxford, 10 February 2021
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: More robust matrix scaling when using linear equality constraints
  in ``constr_templ`` with ``linear_method='lsq_box'``. Thanks to Shravan Shetty
  (pku.edu.cn) for a detailed report and for testing my fix.

V7.4.3: MC, Oxford, 21 December 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``capfit``: New ``linear_method`` keyword to select between ``cvxopt`` or
  ``lsq_lin``, when using linear constraints, for cases where the latter stops.
  The ``cvxopt`` package must be installed when setting that option.
- ``ppxf``: Adapted to use ``capfit`` with ``linear_method='cvxopt'`` when
  enforcing linear constraints on the kinematics with ``constr_kinem``.
- ``ppxf``: Included NOTE in the documentation of ``constr_kinem``.
  All changes above were after detailed reports by Kyle Westfall (ucolick.org).

V7.4.2: MC, Oxford, 9 October 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``ppxf``: Corrected typo in example in the documentation of ``constr_templ``.
- ``ppxf``: Check that ``constr_templ`` and ``constr_kinem`` are dictionaries.
  Thanks to Davide Bevacqua (unibo.it) for the feedback.

V7.4.1: MC, Oxford, 11 September 2020
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``capfit``: Fixed possible infinite loop in ``lsq_box`` and ``lsq_lin``.
  Thanks to Shravan Shetty (pku.edu.cn) for the detailed report and to both
  him and Kyle Westfall (ucolick.org) for testing the fix.
- ``capfit``: Use NumPy rather than the SciPy version of ``linalg.lstsq`` to
  avoid a current SciPy bug in the default criterion for rank deficiency.
- ``capfit``: Renamed ``cond`` keyword to ``rcond`` for consistency with NumPy.
- ``capfit``: Passed ``rcond`` keyword to ``cov_err`` function.
- ``ppxf``: removed ``rcond`` keyword in ``capfit`` call. Use default instead.

V7.4.0: MC, Oxford, 20 August 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``capfit``: New function ``lsq_lin`` implementing a linear least-squares
  linearly constrained algorithm supporting rank-deficient matrices and allowing
  for a starting guess.
- ``capfit``: Removed the ``lsqlin`` procedure which is superseded by ``lsq_lin``.
- ``capfit``: Renamed ``lsqbox`` to ``lsq_box`` and revised its interface.
- ``ppxf``: Modified to use the new ``lsq_lin`` and the updated ``lsq_box`` functions.

  Vaidehi S. Paliya (desy.de) for pointing out the inconsistency in my example.

V7.3.0: MC, Oxford, 10 July 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``capfit``: New function ``lsqbox`` implementing a fast linear least-squares
  box-constrained (bounds) algorithm which allows for a starting guess.
  While testing I also discovered a major mistake in the current implementation
  of ``scipy.optimize.lsq_linear`` (my fix was later included in Scipy 1.6).
- ``ppxf``: The new ``linear_method='lsqbox'`` and ``linear_method='cvxopt'``
  now use an initial guess for the solution, which significantly speeds up the
  kinematic fit with multiple templates. As an example, my procedure
  ``ppxf_example_population_gas_sdss`` is now about 4 times faster with the new
  ``linear_method='lsqbox'`` than with the legacy ``linear_method='nnls'``.
- ``ppxf``: Added support for linear equality constraints on the templates
  ``constr_templ`` and for using the keyword ``fraction`` with both
  ``linear_method='lsqbox'`` and ``linear_method='nnls'``.
- Print ``degree`` and ``mdegree`` with the final results.
- Set ``linear=True`` automatically if the fit has no free non-linear parameters,
  to avoid a program stop. Thanks to Shravan Shetty (pku.edu.cn) for the report.

V7.2.1: MC, Oxford, 12 June 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``capfit``: New input keyword ``cond`` for Jacobian rank tolerance.
- ``capfit``: Use ``bvls`` to solve quadratic subproblem with only ``bounds``.
- ``ppxf``: Set ``cond=1e-7`` in ``capfit`` call, when using linear constraints.
  The ``capfit`` related changes were due to detailed feedback by Kyle Westfall
  (ucolick.org), to deal with situations with degenerate Jacobians, like when
  there is no stellar continuum and one uses multiplicative polynomials.
- ``ppxf``: Clarified documentation for ``.gas_zero_template`` and the
  corresponding warning message, after feedback by Laura Salo (umn.edu).

V7.2.0: MC, Oxford, 4 May 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Allow for ``linear_method='cvxopt'`` when the optional ``cvxopt`` package
  is installed.

  approach to the solution of the linear least-squares subproblem in ``ppxf``.
  Thanks to Sam Vaughan (sydney.edu.au) for a convincing minimal example
  illustrating the usefulness of this keyword.

V7.0.1: MC, Oxford, 8 April 2020
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Support ``.gas_zero_template`` and ``fraction`` together with other
  equality constraints.
- Included ``np.pad(...mode='constant')`` for backward compatibility with
  Numpy 1.16. Thanks to Shravan Shetty (KIAA-PKU) for the suggestion.
- Fix ``rebin()`` not retaining the dimensionality of an input column-vector.
  This resulted in a program stop with a single gas template and
  ``velscale_ratio > 1``. Thanks to Zhiyuan Ji (astro.umass.edu) for a clear
  example reproducing the bug.
- ``capfit``: New keyword ``cond`` for ``lsqlin``.
- ``capfit``: Relaxed assertion for inconsistent inequalities in ``lsqlin``
  to avoid false positives. Thanks to Kyle Westfall (UCO Lick) for a detailed
  bug report.

V6.6.3: MC, Oxford, 25 September 2017
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Reduced bounds on multiplicative polynomials and clipped to positive
  values. Thanks to Xihan Ji (Tsinghua University) for providing an
  example of slightly negative gas emission lines, when the spectrum
  contains essentially just noise.
- Improved visualization of masked pixels.

V6.6.2: MC, Oxford, 15 September 2017
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Fixed program stop with a 2-dim template array and regularization.
  Thanks to Adriano Poci (Macquarie University) for the clear report and

- Force float division in pixel conversion of ``start`` and ``bounds``.

V6.4.1: MC, Oxford, 25 May 2017
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``linear_fit()`` does not return unused status anymore, for
  consistency with the corresponding change to ``cap_mpfit``.

V6.4.0: MC, Oxford, 12 May 2017
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Introduced ``tied`` keyword to tie parameters during fitting.
- Included discussion of formal errors of ``.weights``.

V6.3.2: MC, Oxford, 4 May 2017
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
