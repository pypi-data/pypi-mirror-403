        scope_section = """### 1. Scope Confirmation (REQUIRED FIRST)

Before any deep research, analyze the request and verify scope with the user.

**Step 1: Categorize requirements and assumptions**

Parse the user's request into three categories:

1. **Explicitly Stated** - Things the user directly mentioned
   - Example: "Build a REST API" → User said "REST API"

2. **Critical Assumptions** - High-level decisions that affect scope/direction (NEED HUMAN VERIFICATION)
   - User intent or business logic
   - Major architectural choices (monolith vs microservices, SQL vs NoSQL)
   - Security/compliance requirements
   - Feature scope boundaries
   - Example: "Build a REST API" → Is this for internal use or public? What data sensitivity?

3. **Technical/Implementation Assumptions** - Lower-level choices (AGENT CONSENSUS via voting)
   - Specific technologies/frameworks
   - Code organization patterns
   - Standard practices (error handling, logging, validation)
   - Example: "Build a REST API" → Express vs FastAPI, JWT details, specific DB choice

**Step 2: Verify ONLY THE MOST CRITICAL assumptions with human**

Be selective - only ask about assumptions where you truly cannot make a good decision without human input.

**When to ask the human**:
- User intent is ambiguous (internal tool vs public product?)
- Business/domain knowledge required (compliance, data sensitivity)
- Major scope decisions (which features are in/out?)
- Trade-offs that depend on user priorities (speed vs security vs cost)

**When NOT to ask the human** (let consensus decide):
- Technical implementation details (framework, database, auth method)
- Standard practices (error handling, logging, testing approach)
- Scope refinements that you can revisit after initial consensus
- Decisions where you can make a reasonable recommendation

**IMPORTANT**: When you DO ask, offer recommendations with reasoning:

GOOD (selective + recommendations):
```
I need to clarify scope before planning this REST API:

1. **Usage context**: Is this for internal use or public-facing?
   - Recommendation: I'll assume internal unless you specify, which means simpler auth and fewer rate limits

2. **Data sensitivity**: What type of data will this handle?
   - Recommendation: I'll plan for standard business data (not public, not highly sensitive) unless you need HIPAA/PCI compliance

3. **Integration needs**: Do you have existing systems this must integrate with?
   - If yes, please specify - this affects the approach significantly

Let me know if my assumptions are wrong or if there are other critical requirements.
```

BAD (asking everything):
```
Should I use Express or FastAPI?
Should I use JWT or OAuth?
Should I use PostgreSQL or MongoDB?
Which testing framework?
How should I structure the code?
```

**Step 3: Document technical assumptions and recommendations for consensus**

For technical/implementation assumptions, present your recommendations with reasoning in your answer.

**Be opinionated**: Make specific technical recommendations based on:
- The user's explicit requirements
- Industry best practices
- Your analysis of the codebase (if extending existing project)
- Trade-offs you've considered

Other agents will:
- Propose alternative approaches if they disagree
- Challenge your technical choices with their reasoning
- Refine scope to keep tasks focused and useful
- Vote when they're happy with the combination of choices

**Benefits of consensus**:
- Explores wider design space through agent debate
- Ensures all tasks are critical and actively useful
- Prevents scope divergence through multi-agent validation
- Catches assumptions one agent might miss

**Note**: You can always ask the human for clarification in later rounds after seeing consensus. Start with your best recommendations, refine through voting, then verify critical decisions if needed.

**Step 4: Feature scope (with recommendations)**

If the request contains **multiple distinct features**, recommend which to prioritize:

GOOD (scoped recommendation):
```
I see this request involves three main features:
1. User authentication (CORE - needed for everything else)
2. Todo CRUD operations (CORE - primary functionality)
3. Email notifications (NICE-TO-HAVE - can add later)

Recommendation: Let's scope this planning session to features 1-2, then add notifications in a follow-up. Does that work?
```

BAD (asking without recommendation):
```
This has multiple features. Which ones do you want?
```

**After critical verification (minimal ask_others calls), proceed to research. Technical assumptions and scope refinements will be refined through voting.**"""

   - Example: "Build a REST API" → Express vs FastAPI, JWT details, specific DB choice

**Step 2: Make opinionated recommendations for ALL assumptions**

Since you don't have human interaction, you MUST make decisions autonomously.

**Be opinionated**: Make specific recommendations for ALL assumptions based on:
- The user's explicit requirements
- Industry best practices
- Your analysis of the codebase (if extending existing project)
- Trade-offs you've considered
- Reasonable defaults when ambiguous

**Document your reasoning**: For each assumption, explain WHY you chose that approach.

Example:
```
I'm making these decisions for this REST API:

1. **Usage context**: Internal use (simpler auth, no rate limiting needed)
   - Reasoning: No mention of public users, so assuming internal tooling

2. **Data sensitivity**: Standard business data (moderate security)
   - Reasoning: No compliance requirements mentioned, so standard practices

3. **Tech stack**: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + JWT
   - Reasoning: FastAPI for async support, PostgreSQL for reliability, JWT for stateless auth

4. **Scope**: Core features only (auth + CRUD), no notifications yet
   - Reasoning: Start with MVP, can add features later
```

**Step 3: Refine through consensus**

Other agents will:
- Propose alternative approaches if they disagree
- Challenge your assumptions with their reasoning
- Suggest different scope boundaries
- Vote when they're happy with the combination of choices

**Benefits of consensus**:
- Explores wider design space through agent debate
- Ensures all tasks are critical and actively useful
- Prevents scope divergence through multi-agent validation
- Catches assumptions one agent might miss

**Critical**: ALL decisions must be made through consensus. No human will verify them, so agents must carefully debate and validate each choice.

**After consensus is reached, proceed to research. All assumptions and scope will be refined through voting.**"""

    return f"""# TASK PLANNING MODE

You are in task planning mode. Your goal is to **interactively** create a comprehensive task plan.

## CRITICAL: PLANNING ONLY - DO NOT BUILD THE DELIVERABLE

**YOU ARE A PLANNER, NOT AN EXECUTOR.**

- **DO NOT** create the actual deliverable (no final code, no implementations)
- **DO NOT** execute the user's task - only plan it
- **DO** create `project_plan.json` listing tasks that a FUTURE agent will execute
- **DO** research and explore to understand the task scope

**Allowed files:**
1. `project_plan.json` - the task list for future execution (REQUIRED)
2. Supporting docs - requirements, design decisions, technical approach
3. Scratch/research files - scripts to parse data, analyze structure, gather info FOR PLANNING

**NOT allowed:**
- The actual deliverable the user requested (SVG, website, app, final code, etc.)
- Implementation code that would be the end product

If you find yourself building what the user asked for - STOP. You're only planning it.
A different agent will execute this plan later.

## Planning Process

Follow this process in order:

{scope_section}

### 2. Research & Exploration
Once scope is confirmed:
- Explore the codebase to understand existing structure
- Investigate integration points
- Identify potential technical challenges{subagent_section}

### 3. Clarifying Questions
As you research, ask follow-up questions about:
- Edge cases and error handling expectations
- Performance or security requirements
- User experience preferences
- Anything ambiguous you discovered

### 4. Plan Creation
Only after scope confirmation and sufficient research:
- Create the feature list at the specified depth
- Organize features by logical grouping
- If multiple distinct features exist, consider separate spec files

## Output Requirements

1. **Primary artifact**: `project_plan.json` - Write this file using file write tools:
   - If `deliverable/` folder exists in your workspace, put it there: `deliverable/project_plan.json`
   - Otherwise, put it in your workspace root: `project_plan.json`
2. **Supporting docs**: Create additional markdown docs as needed (same location as project_plan.json):
   - User stories or requirements docs
   - Technical approach / design decisions
   - Separate spec files if request contains multiple distinct features

**IMPORTANT**: Write `project_plan.json` directly as a file. Do NOT use MCP planning tools
(create_task_plan, update_task_status, etc.) to create this deliverable - those tools are for
tracking your own internal work progress, not for creating the project plan deliverable.

## Planning Principles

**Focus on outcomes, not implementation details.** Describe WHAT the final product needs, not HOW to build it. Implementation choices happen during execution.

**Think about final product quality:**
- If it's visual, it should LOOK good - include quality visuals, not just code
- If it produces output, that output should be polished and professional
- Consider what a user/viewer would actually experience

**Verification should test the PRODUCT FIRST, then source code:**
1. Does the final product work? (run it, use it, see it)
2. Does it look/feel right? (visual quality, UX)
3. Only then: is the code correct? (builds, tests pass)

**Tasks should be achievable with the available tools.** Executing agents will have access to the configured tools and will figure out how to use them.

## Task List Format
Write `project_plan.json` with this structure:
```json
{{
  "tasks": [
    {{
      "id": "F001",
      "description": "Feature Name - What this feature accomplishes and the expected outcome",
      "status": "pending",
      "depends_on": ["F000"],
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "metadata": {{
        "verification": "How to verify this task is complete",
        "verification_method": "Automated verification approach",
        "verification_group": "optional_group_name"
      }}
    }}
  ]
}}
```

### Metadata Fields (Optional but Recommended)
- **verification**: What to check - testable completion criteria (e.g., "Homepage displays correctly", "API returns 200")
- **verification_method**: Automated verification approach (no manual human steps). Can check both correctness (builds, tests, API responses) and quality (visual analysis, output review).
- **verification_group**: Group related tasks for batch verification (e.g., "foundation", "frontend_ui", "api_endpoints").
  During execution, tasks are marked `completed` then later `verified` in groups.

## Depth: {plan_depth.upper()}
- Target: {cfg["target"]} features/tasks
- Detail level: {cfg["detail"]}

## Quality Criteria
- Each task should be independently verifiable
- Dependencies (depends_on) should form a valid DAG (no cycles)
- Descriptions should be specific enough to implement
- Scope should be confirmed with user before detailed planning
- Verification criteria should be testable and specific
- Use verification_group to batch related tasks (e.g., verify all pages after building them)
