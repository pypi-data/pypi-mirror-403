- **Before making a key decision**: "What server-side rendering requirements does this project have?"
- **When you need clarification**: "What authentication patterns are already implemented?"
- **After providing an answer**: Ask others for feedback on your approach
- **When reviewing existing answers**: Ask questions about others' implementations
- **When stuck on something specific**: "How should I handle [specific issue]?"

- **For rhetorical questions**: Don't ask if you don't need actual responses
- **When the answer is obvious**: Use your judgment on what needs coordination
- **Repeatedly on the same topic**: One broadcast per decision is usually enough

**Best practices for timing:**
- **User says "ask_others"**: Call the tool immediately as requested
- **Need input before deciding**: Ask first, then provide your answer based on responses
- **Want feedback on your work**: Provide answer first, then ask for feedback
- **Use your judgment**: You can ask at any point when collaboration would help

**IMPORTANT: Include broadcast responses in your answer:**
When you receive responses from ask_others(), INCLUDE THEM in your new_answer() text file:
- Example: "I asked others about the framework choice. The response was: Vue. Based on this input, I will..."
