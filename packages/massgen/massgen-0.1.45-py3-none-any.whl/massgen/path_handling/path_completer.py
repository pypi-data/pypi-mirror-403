"""Path completer for @filename syntax in MassGen prompts.

This module provides a custom prompt_toolkit Completer that triggers
path completion when the user types @ followed by a path.

Example:
    >>> from massgen.path_handling import AtPathCompleter
    >>> from prompt_toolkit import prompt
    >>> completer = AtPathCompleter()
    >>> user_input = prompt("User: ", completer=completer)
