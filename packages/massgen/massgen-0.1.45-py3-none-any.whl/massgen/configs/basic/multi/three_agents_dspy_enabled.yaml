# MassGen Three Agent Configuration with DSPy Paraphrasing Enabled
# This configuration demonstrates how to enable DSPy question paraphrasing for multi-agent coordination.
# Each agent receives a paraphrased version of the original question to encourage diverse perspectives and more comprehensive answers through varied interpretations.
# Usage: massgen --config massgen/configs/basic/multi/three_agents_dspy_enabled.yaml "Explain the differences between transformer architecture and recurrent neural networks"
