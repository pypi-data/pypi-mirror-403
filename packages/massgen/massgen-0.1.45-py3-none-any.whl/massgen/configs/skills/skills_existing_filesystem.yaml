# Skills with Existing Filesystem and Memory
# Case Study: Skills Self-Extension
# Demonstrates agents analyzing codebase, discovering workflows, and creating their own skills
#
# Run with:
#   uv run massgen --config massgen/configs/skills/skills_existing_filesystem.yaml "Analyze the MassGen codebase to identify common development workflows that could benefit from being codified as skills. Create 1-2 optional skills that would help future agents work more efficiently with the codebase."
