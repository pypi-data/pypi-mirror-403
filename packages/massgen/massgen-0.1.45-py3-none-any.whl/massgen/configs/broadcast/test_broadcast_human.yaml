# uv run massgen --config test_broadcast_human.yaml "Design and implement a web scraper"

task: |
  Design and implement a simple web scraper that extracts article titles
  and dates from a news website. The agents should coordinate on the approach
  and you (the human) can provide input when they ask questions.

agents:
  - id: agent_a
    backend:
      type: openai
      model: gpt-5

  - id: agent_b
    backend:
      type: gemini
      model: gemini-3-pro-preview
      cwd: workspace2

  # Enable agent-to-agent AND human communication
  coordination:
    broadcast: "human"  # Human will be prompted for responses
    broadcast_sensitivity: "high"  # Options: "low" | "medium" | "high" (how frequently agents use ask_others)
    response_depth: "medium"  # Options: "low" | "medium" | "high" (test-time compute scaling for shadow agents)
    broadcast_timeout: 60  # Shorter timeout for testing
