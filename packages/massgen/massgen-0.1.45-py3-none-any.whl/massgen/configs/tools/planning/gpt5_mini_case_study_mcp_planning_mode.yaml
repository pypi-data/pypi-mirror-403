# Three Agent Discord MCP Test Configuration with Planning Mode
# This configuration demonstrates planning vs execution mode to prevent duplicate tool calls
# during coordination while allowing full tool execution during final presentation
#
# Setup Requirements:
# 1. Install Discord MCP server: npm install -g mcp-discord
# 2. Set environment variables in .env file:
#    DISCORD_TOKEN="your_discord_bot_token"
#    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
#
# Example usage:
# massgen --config @examples/tools/planning/gpt5_mini_case_study_mcp_planning_mode "Please read https://github.com/Leezekun/MassGen/issues/276 and send a message to the 'MassGen Testing Server' Discord server in the general channel with a summary and implementation next steps to notify the team of your approach. The guild ID is 1417773298309136445 and channel ID is 1417773298837880906"

      PLANNING MODE ACTIVE: You are currently in the coordination phase where agents discuss and plan their approach.
      During this phase, you should:
      1. Describe your intended actions and reasoning
      2. Analyze other agents' proposals
      3. Use only the 'vote' or 'new_answer' tools for coordination
      4. You CAN use web search for information gathering
      5. DO NOT execute any actions that have side effects (e.g., sending messages, modifying data)
      6. Save actions that have side effects for the final presentation phase when the winning agent will implement the plan

      Focus on planning, analysis, and coordination rather than execution.
