# Example Configuration: GitHub Issue Market Analysis for Self-Evolution
#
# Use Case: Demonstrate Self-Evolution (Market Analysis) using custom tools
#
# This configuration showcases how MassGen agents can autonomously analyze
# GitHub issues AND broader market trends to prioritize features and drive
# market-driven development using access to the current MassGen code, custom tools + web search.
#
# Run with:
#   uv run massgen --config massgen/configs/tools/custom_tools/github_issue_market_analysis.yaml "Analyze the massgen dir and MassGen GitHub issues to understand what features users are requesting. Also research current trends in multi-agent AI systems and LLM orchestration. Based on the existing code, the open issues and market trends, write a prioritized recommendation report for the next release."

  # Adjust these settings to control collaboration behavior
  # voting_sensitivity: Controls how critical agents are when voting
  #   - "lenient": Agents vote for answers more readily (default)
  #   - "balanced": Moderate voting threshold
  #   - "strict": Agents are more critical, vote only for excellent answers
  voting_sensitivity: "balanced"

  # answer_novelty_requirement: How different new answers must be
  #   - "lenient": Allow similar answers with minor variations (default)
  #   - "balanced": Require moderate differences
  #   - "strict": Require substantial novelty

# What happens:
# 1. Both agents have access to:
#    - Custom fetch_github_issues tool (analyzes user requests)
#    - Web search (researches market trends and competitors)
# 2. User asks agents to combine GitHub issues + market research
# 3. Agents independently:
#    - Fetch and analyze GitHub issues using custom tool
#    - Research market trends using web search
#    - Synthesize both sources into recommendations
# 4. Agents collaborate through voting to reach consensus
# 5. Final answer provides data-driven feature prioritization report
