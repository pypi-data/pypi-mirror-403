# MassGen Configuration: OpenAI Lesson Planner Tool
# This demonstrates interoperability by using OpenAI's Chat Completions API as a custom tool
#
# Usage:
#   massgen --config @examples/tools/custom_tools/interop/openai_assistant_lesson_planner_example.yaml "Create a lesson plan for photosynthesis"
#   uv run python -m massgen.cli --config @examples/tools/custom_tools/interop/openai_assistant_lesson_planner_example.yaml "Create a lesson plan for photosynthesis"
#
# Description:
#   This configuration uses OpenAI's Chat Completions API with multi-agent collaboration to create comprehensive lesson plans.
#   The tool uses multiple specialized agents (similar to AG2) that work sequentially:
#   1. Curriculum Agent: Identifies relevant curriculum standards and learning objectives
#   2. Lesson Planner Agent: Designs engaging lesson activities with proper timing
#   3. Lesson Reviewer Agent: Reviews the plan for age-appropriateness and effectiveness
#   4. Formatter Agent: Formats the final lesson plan in a structured format
#   This demonstrates interoperability between MassGen and OpenAI's API using a role-based collaboration pattern.
#
# Requirements:
#   - pip install openai
#   - OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable must be set
