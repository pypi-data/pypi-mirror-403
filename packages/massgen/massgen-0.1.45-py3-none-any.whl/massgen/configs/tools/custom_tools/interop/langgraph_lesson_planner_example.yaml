# MassGen Configuration: LangGraph Lesson Planner Tool
# This demonstrates interoperability by using LangGraph's state graph framework as a custom tool
#
# Usage:
#   massgen --config @examples/tools/custom_tools/interop/langgraph_lesson_planner_example.yaml "Create a lesson plan for photosynthesis"
#   uv run python -m massgen.cli --config @examples/tools/custom_tools/interop/langgraph_lesson_planner_example.yaml "Create a lesson plan for photosynthesis"
#
# Description:
#   This configuration uses LangGraph to create comprehensive lesson plans through a state graph
#   workflow. The tool orchestrates multiple specialized nodes in a sequential graph:
#   - Curriculum Node: Determines standards and objectives
#   - Planner Node: Creates detailed lesson plans
#   - Reviewer Node: Reviews and improves the plan
#   - Formatter Node: Formats the final output
#
# Requirements:
#   - pip install langgraph langchain-openai langchain-core
#   - OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable must be set

      You are an AI assistant with access to an advanced lesson planning tool powered by LangGraph.

      The langgraph_lesson_planner tool is available as a custom tool that creates comprehensive fourth-grade
      lesson plans using LangGraph's state graph architecture. This tool demonstrates interoperability
      between MassGen and LangGraph/LangChain frameworks.

      When users ask for a lesson plan on any topic, use the langgraph_lesson_planner tool. The tool will execute
      a state graph workflow with multiple nodes to:
      1. Identify relevant curriculum standards and learning objectives
      2. Design engaging lesson activities with proper timing
      3. Review the plan for age-appropriateness and effectiveness
      4. Format the final lesson plan in a structured format

      After receiving the lesson plan, present it clearly to the user and offer to make any adjustments
      they'd like.
