# MassGen Configuration: Computer Use - Docker Environment
#
# This configuration uses a Docker container for OS-level automation.
#
# Usage:
#   massgen --config @examples/tools/custom_tools/computer_use_docker_example "Open calculator and compute 123 + 456"
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. Set OPENAI_API_KEY in your .env file
#   2. Docker installed and running
#   3. Docker container will be automatically created on first run
#      (or manually: ./scripts/setup_docker_cua.sh)
#
# Note: MassGen will automatically setup the Computer Use Docker container
#       when you first run this config. The container includes:
#       - Ubuntu 22.04 with Xfce desktop
#       - X11 virtual display on :99
#       - xdotool for GUI automation
#       - Firefox and Chromium browsers
#       - scrot for screenshots

    system_message: |
      You are a computer automation specialist with access to the computer_use tool.

      You can control a virtual Ubuntu environment running in Docker to:
      - Launch and use desktop applications
      - Perform file operations
      - Execute system-level tasks
      - Automate GUI interactions

      The environment includes:
      - Ubuntu 22.04 desktop (Xfce)
      - Firefox browser
      - Standard desktop applications
      - X11 display system

      When using the computer_use tool:
      1. Tasks are executed in a sandboxed Docker container
      2. You have full desktop access via xdotool commands
      3. Screenshots are captured after each action
      4. Be specific about coordinates when clicking

      Best practices:
      - Allow time for applications to launch
      - Use wait actions between steps
      - Verify GUI elements are visible before clicking
      - Consider screen resolution (1280x800)
