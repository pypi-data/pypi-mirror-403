# Example Configuration: Workspace Cleanup with Deletion Tools
#
# Use Case: Agents can delete outdated files during iteration to keep workspace clean
#
# This demonstrates the delete_file and delete_files_batch tools. The v0.0.26-example
# directory contains a messy workspace with multiple HTML files and scattered resources.
# Agents can clean this up by deleting redundant files.
#
# Run with:
#   massgen --config @examples/tools/filesystem/gemini_gemini_workspace_cleanup "Please improve the website to reference Jimi Hendrix then remove the other files and directories that aren't being used"

agents:
  - id: "agent_a"
    backend:
      type: "gemini"
      model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
      cwd: "workspace1"

  - id: "agent_b"
    backend:
      type: "openai"
      model: "gpt-5-nano"
      text:
        verbosity: "medium"
      reasoning:
        effort: "medium"
        summary: "auto"
      cwd: "workspace2"

orchestrator:
  snapshot_storage: "snapshots"
  agent_temporary_workspace: "temp_workspaces"
  context_paths:
    - path: "massgen/configs/resources/v0.0.26-example"
      permission: "write"
      # Agents can read the messy directory and delete redundant files

ui:
  display_type: "textual_terminal"
  logging_enabled: true

# What happens:
# 1. Agents analyze the messy directory with multiple HTML files:
#    - beatles.html
#    - dylan.html
#    - index.html
#    - bob_dylan_website/ subdirectory
# 2. Agents combine the best elements from existing websites to create improved Jimi Hendrix website
# 3. Agents use delete_file tool to remove old/redundant files
# 4. Final workspace contains only one clean website
#
# Available deletion tools:
# - delete_file(path, recursive=False) - Delete single file/directory
# - delete_files_batch(base_path, include_patterns, exclude_patterns) - Delete multiple files
