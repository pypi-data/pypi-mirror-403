# Multi-Turn Filesystem Configuration Example
#
# This configuration enables agents to build upon previous work across multiple conversation turns.
#
# Key Features:
# - context_paths: Gives agents access to your project files
#   - Use "." for current directory to work directly in your project
#   - Files are read-only during coordination, writable by final agent
#
# Example usage:
# massgen --config @examples/tools/filesystem/multiturn_grok4_gpt5_claude_code_filesystem_multiturn
#
# Or with uv tool:
# uv tool run massgen --config tools/filesystem/multiturn/grok4_gpt5_claude_code_filesystem_multiturn.yaml

agents:
  - id: "agent_a"
    backend:
      type: "grok"
      model: "grok-4-fast-reasoning"  # "grok-code-fast-1"
      cwd: "workspace1"  # Working directory for file operations

        summary: "auto"
      cwd: "workspace2"  # this is for the desired version

  - id: "agent_c"
    backend:
      type: "claude_code"
      cwd: "workspace3"  # Working directory for file operations
      model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"

orchestrator:
    snapshot_storage: "snapshots"  # Directory to store workspace snapshots
    agent_temporary_workspace: "temp_workspaces"  # Directory for temporary agent workspaces

    # Context paths - give agents access to your project files
    # Tip: Use "." to automatically work in current directory
    context_paths:
      - path: "."  # Current directory (where you run massgen)
        permission: "write"  # Allow final agent to create/modify files
        # Optional: Add protected_paths to prevent accidental modifications
        # protected_paths:
        #   - ".env"
        #   - "config.json"
