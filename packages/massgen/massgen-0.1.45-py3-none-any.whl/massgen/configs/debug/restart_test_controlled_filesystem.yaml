# Two Agent Orchestration Restart Test Configuration with Filesystem
# This configuration demonstrates the orchestration restart feature with MCP filesystem tools
# Uses debug_final_answer to force restart on first attempt for testing file creation tasks
#
# Setup Requirements:
# 1. Set environment variable in .env file:
#    OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"
# 2. Filesystem MCP servers will be automatically available via npx
#
# Example usage:
# massgen --config @examples/configs/debug/restart_test_controlled_filesystem.yaml "Create three Python files: main.py with a hello() function, utils.py with a helper() function, and tests.py with a test_hello() function."
#
# Expected behavior:
# - Attempt 1: Agents coordinate with planning mode (no file execution during coordination)
# - Final presentation shows debug override claiming only main.py was created
# - Post-evaluation uses MCP tools to verify files and detects missing files
# - Calls restart_orchestration() with specific instructions
# - Restart banner displays
# - Attempt 2: Agents coordinate with restart instructions to create ALL files
# - Post-evaluation verifies all files exist using MCP tools
# - Calls submit() - Inspection menu appears

    I created a hello.txt file.

   #  file with the following content:

   # ```python
   # def hello():
   #     print("Hello, World!")

   # if __name__ == "__main__":
   #     hello()
   # ```

  # The file has been created successfully.

  # Use lenient voting for faster coordination in debug mode
