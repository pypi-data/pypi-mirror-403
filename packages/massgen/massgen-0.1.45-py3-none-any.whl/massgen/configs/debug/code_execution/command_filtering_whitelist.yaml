# Command Execution with Whitelist Filtering (Python/Testing Only)
# Run with: uv run python -m massgen.cli --config massgen/configs/debug/code_execution/command_filtering_whitelist.yaml "Write and test a sorting algorithm in a non-Python language"
# Expected behavior: Agent can only run Python commands and pytest for testing, so will fail to run non-Python code. It will thus fail or timeout without completing the task.
# Note this is a test; we would never ask for the conflicting task in practice.
