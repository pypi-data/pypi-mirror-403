# MassGen Voting Sensitivity Configuration Example
#
# How to run:
#   massgen --config configs/voting/gemini_gpt_voting_sensitivity.yaml "Your question here"
#
# Or in interactive mode:
#   massgen --config configs/voting/gemini_gpt_voting_sensitivity.yaml
#
# Try different sensitivity levels by changing the voting_sensitivity value below

orchestrator:
  # voting_sensitivity controls how critical agents are when evaluating answers
  #
  # Options:
  #   - "lenient" (default): Agents vote for existing answers more readily, fewer new answers
  #                          Use when you want faster convergence
  #
  #   - "balanced": Agents apply detailed criteria (comprehensive, accurate, complete?) before voting,
  #                 more new answers. Use when you want thorough evaluation
  #
  #   - "strict": Agents apply high standards of excellence (all aspects, edge cases, reference-quality) before voting,
  #               most new answers. Use when you need maximum quality
  #
  voting_sensitivity: "balanced"

  # max_new_answers_per_agent controls how many new answers each agent can provide
  # Once an agent reaches this limit, they can only vote (not provide new answers)
  #
  # Options:
  #   - null (default): No limit - agents can provide unlimited new answers
  #   - 1, 2, 3, etc.: Cap the number of new answers per agent
  #
  # Example: Set to 2 for thorough evaluation but bounded duration
  max_new_answers_per_agent: 2

  # answer_novelty_requirement controls how different new answers must be from existing ones
  #
  # Options:
  #   - "lenient" (default): No additional checks - current behavior (fastest)
  #   - "balanced": Reject if >70% token overlap - requires meaningful differences
  #   - "strict": Reject if >50% token overlap - requires substantially different solutions
  #
  # Example: Use "balanced" to prevent agents from just rephrasing the same answer
  answer_novelty_requirement: "balanced"
