Workspace Tools MCP Server for MassGen

This MCP server provides workspace management tools for agents including file operations,
deletion, and comparison capabilities. It implements copy-on-write behavior for multi-agent
collaboration and provides safe file manipulation within allowed paths.

Tools provided:
- copy_file: Copy a single file or directory from any accessible path to workspace
- copy_files_batch: Copy multiple files with pattern matching and exclusions
- delete_file: Delete a single file or directory from workspace
- delete_files_batch: Delete multiple files with pattern matching
- compare_directories: Compare two directories and show differences
- compare_files: Compare two text files and show unified diff
- generate_and_store_image_with_input_images: Create variations of existing images using gpt-4.1
- generate_and_store_image_no_input_images: Generate new images from text prompts using gpt-4.1
- generate_and_store_audio_no_input_audios: Generate audio from text using OpenAI's gpt-4o-audio-preview model
- generate_text_with_input_audio: Transcribe audio files to text using OpenAI's Transcription API
