# Example Configuration: Context Window Management with Memory
#
# Use Case: Demonstrates automatic context compression when approaching token limits
#
# This configuration demonstrates:
# - Automatic context window monitoring and compression
# - Token-aware conversation management (75% threshold, 40% target)
# - Persistent memory integration for long-term knowledge retention
# - Graceful handling when context window fills up
# - Multi-agent collaboration with shared context management

# ====================
# MEMORY CONFIGURATION
# ====================
memory:
  # Enable/disable persistent memory (default: true)
  enabled: true
  # # Debug mode
  # debug: true

  # Memory configuration
  conversation_memory:
    enabled: true  # Short-term conversation tracking (recommended: always true)

  persistent_memory:
    enabled: true  # Long-term knowledge storage (set to false to disable)
    on_disk: true  # Persist across restarts
    # session_name: "test_session"  # Optional - if not specified, auto-generates unique ID
                                     # Format: agent_storyteller_20251023_143022_a1b2c3
                                     # Specify to continue a specific session

    # Vector store backend (default: qdrant)
    vector_store: "qdrant"

    # LLM configuration for memory operations (fact extraction)
    # RECOMMENDED: Use mem0's native LLMs (no adapter overhead, no async complexity)
    llm:
      provider: "openai"  # Options: openai, anthropic, groq, together, etc.
      model: "gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14"  # Fast and cheap model for memory ops (mem0's default)

    # Embedding configuration (uses mem0's native embedders)
    # RECOMMENDED: Specify provider and model for clarity
    embedding:
      provider: "openai"  # Options: openai, together, azure_openai, gemini, huggingface, etc.
      model: "text-embedding-3-small"  # OpenAI's efficient embedding model

    # Qdrant client configuration
    # IMPORTANT: For multi-agent setups, use server mode to avoid concurrent access errors
    qdrant:
      mode: "server"  # Options: "server" (recommended for multi-agent) or "local" (single agent only)
      host: "localhost"  # Qdrant server host (default: localhost)
      port: 6333         # Qdrant server port (default: 6333)
      # For local mode (single agent only):
      # mode: "local"
      # path: ".massgen/qdrant"  # Local storage path

  # # Enable detailed recording for testing
  # recording:
  #   record_all_tool_calls: true   # Capture ALL MCP tools
  #   record_reasoning: true         # Capture reasoning separately

  # Context window management thresholds
  compression:
    trigger_threshold: 0.25  # Compress when context usage exceeds 25%
    target_ratio: 0.10       # Target 10% of context after compression

  # Memory retrieval configuration
  retrieval:
    limit: 5              # Number of memory facts to retrieve from mem0 (default: 5)
    exclude_recent: true  # Only retrieve after compression to avoid duplicates (default: true)

# Memory system behavior when enabled:
# - ConversationMemory: Tracks short-term conversation history (verbatim messages)
# - PersistentMemory: Stores long-term knowledge in vector database (extracted facts via mem0)
# - Automatic compression: Triggers at threshold, removes old messages from conversation_memory
# - Smart retrieval: Only retrieves from persistent_memory AFTER compression
#   - Before compression: All context in conversation_memory, no retrieval (avoids duplicates)
#   - After compression: Retrieves relevant facts from compressed messages
# - Each agent gets separate memory: agent_name defaults to agent ID (agent_a, agent_b)
#
# How mem0 works:
# - When recording: mem0's LLM extracts key facts from conversations
# - When retrieving: Returns extracted facts (e.g., "User explored Mars", not full conversation)
# - retrieval.limit controls how many facts to retrieve (each fact is ~1 sentence)
#
# Session management (UNIFIED):
# - Each agent gets separate memory (agent_name = agent ID: agent_a, agent_b)
# - Session ID is unified between orchestrator and memory system:
#   - Interactive mode: session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS (created at start, shared by all turns)
#   - Single question: temp_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS (created per run, isolated)
# - Memories are isolated per session: agent_a in session_1 can't access session_2 memories
# - To continue a previous session: Specify session_name in YAML (overrides auto-generation)
# - For cross-session memory: Remove session_name from YAML or set to null
# - Qdrant database: Shared at .massgen/qdrant, filtered by agent_id + session_id
#
# Recording options (NEW - v0.1.6):
# memory.recording.record_all_tool_calls: false  # Record ALL MCP tools (list_directory, read_file, etc.)
# memory.recording.record_reasoning: false       # Record reasoning chunks separately
#
# To disable persistent memory for testing, set:
#   memory.persistent_memory.enabled: false
#
# See massgen/memory/docs/ for detailed documentation.

# ====================
# EXECUTION FLOW
# ====================
# What happens:
# 1. User starts an interactive story with the agent
# 2. Agent responds with detailed narrative (400-600 words per turn)
# 3. As conversation continues, token usage is monitored automatically
# 4. When context usage reaches 75% of model's limit:
#    - System logs: "📊 Context usage: X / Y tokens (Z%) - compressing old context"
#    - Old messages are compressed into persistent memory (if configured)
#    - Recent messages (fitting in 40% of context window) are kept
#    - Compression details logged: "📦 Compressed N messages (X tokens) into long-term memory"
# 5. Agent continues seamlessly with compressed context
# 6. Story maintains consistency by referencing persistent memories
# 7. Process repeats as needed for very long conversations
#
# Expected logs with persistent memory:
#
# Turn 1-10 (Before compression):
#   📊 Context Window (Turn 5): 45,000 / 128,000 tokens (35%)
#   ⏭️  Skipping retrieval (no compression yet, all context in conversation_memory)
#
# Turn 11 (Compression triggers):
#   ⚠️  Context Window (Turn 11): 96,000 / 128,000 tokens (75%) - Approaching limit!
#   🔄 Attempting compression (96,000 → 51,200 tokens)
#   📦 Context compressed: Removed 15 old messages (44,800 tokens).
#      Kept 8 recent messages (51,200 tokens).
#      Old messages remain accessible via semantic search.
#   ✅ Conversation history updated after compression: 8 messages
#
# Turn 12+ (After compression):
#   🔍 Retrieving compressed memories (limit=5, compressed=True)...
#   💭 Retrieved 3 memory fact(s) from mem0
#   [Agent sees: retrieved facts + recent 8 messages - no duplication!]
#
# Expected output WITHOUT persistent memory:
#   📦 Context compressed: Removed 15 messages (44,800 tokens).
#      No persistent memory - old messages NOT retrievable.
#
# Token Budget Allocation (after compression):
# - Conversation history: 40% (kept in active context)
# - Retrieved memories: ~5 facts (~100-250 tokens)
# - New user messages: varies
# - System prompt overhead: varies
# - Response generation: varies
