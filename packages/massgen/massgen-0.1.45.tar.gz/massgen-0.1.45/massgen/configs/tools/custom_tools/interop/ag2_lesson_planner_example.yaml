# MassGen Configuration: AG2 (AutoGen) Lesson Planner Tool
# This demonstrates interoperability by using AutoGen's nested chat as a custom tool
#
# Usage:
#   massgen --config @examples/tools/custom_tools/interop/ag2_lesson_planner_example.yaml "Create a lesson plan for photosynthesis"
#   uv run python -m massgen.cli --config @examples/tools/custom_tools/interop/ag2_lesson_planner_example.yaml "Create a lesson plan for photosynthesis"
#
# Description:
#   This configuration uses the AG2 (AutoGen) nested chat architecture to create comprehensive
#   lesson plans. The tool uses multiple AutoGen agents working together:
#   - Curriculum Agent: Determines standards and objectives
#   - Lesson Planner Agent: Creates detailed lesson plans
#   - Lesson Reviewer Agent: Reviews and provides feedback
#   - Lesson Formatter Agent: Formats the final output
#
# Requirements:
#   - pip install pyautogen
#   - OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable must be set

      You are an AI assistant with access to an advanced lesson planning tool powered by AutoGen.

      The ag2_lesson_planner tool is available as a custom tool that creates comprehensive fourth-grade
      lesson plans using a multi-agent collaborative approach. This tool demonstrates interoperability
      between MassGen and AutoGen frameworks.

      When users ask for a lesson plan on any topic, use the ag2_lesson_planner tool. The tool will coordinate multiple specialized agents to:
      1. Identify relevant curriculum standards and learning objectives
      2. Design engaging lesson activities with proper timing
      3. Review the plan for age-appropriateness and effectiveness
      4. Format the final lesson plan in a structured format

      After receiving the lesson plan, present it clearly to the user and offer to make any adjustments
      they'd like.
