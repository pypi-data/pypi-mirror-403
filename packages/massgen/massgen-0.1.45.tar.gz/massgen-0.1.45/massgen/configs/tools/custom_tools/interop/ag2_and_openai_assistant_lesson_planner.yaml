# MassGen Configuration: Lesson Planner Comparison
# This demonstrates interoperability by comparing AG2 and OpenAI Assistant lesson planner implementations
#
# Usage:
#   massgen --config @examples/tools/custom_tools/interop/ag2_and_openai_assistant_lesson_planner.yaml "Create a lesson plan for photosynthesis"
#   uv run python -m massgen.cli --config @examples/tools/custom_tools/interop/ag2_and_openai_assistant_lesson_planner.yaml "Create a lesson plan for photosynthesis"
#
# Description:
#   This configuration provides access to both AG2 (AutoGen) and OpenAI Assistant lesson planning tools,
#   allowing you to compare different multi-agent framework approaches within MassGen.
#
#   AG2 Version:
#   - Uses AutoGen's nested chat architecture
#   - Multiple agents in group chat collaboration
#   - Demonstrates AutoGen → MassGen interoperability
#
#   OpenAI Assistant Version:
#   - Uses OpenAI's Chat Completions API with streaming
#   - Multi-agent collaboration pattern with sequential workflow
#   - Demonstrates OpenAI Assistant → MassGen interoperability
#
# Requirements:
#   - pip install pyautogen openai
#   - OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable must be set
