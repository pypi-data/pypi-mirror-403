# MassGen Configuration: Gemini Computer Use (Browser)
#
# This configuration uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Computer Use Preview model
# for browser automation tasks on the host machine.
#
# Note: The gemini_computer_use tool calls the Gemini API directly (similar to
# how computer_use calls OpenAI directly), so it bypasses MassGen's normal tool flow.
#
# Usage (with visible browser):
#   DISPLAY=:20 massgen --config gemini_computer_use_example.yaml
#
# Usage (headless mode):
#   Set headless: true in environment_config below
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. Set GEMINI_API_KEY in your .env file
#   2. Install Playwright: pip install playwright
#   3. Install browsers: playwright install chromium
#   4. Install Google GenAI SDK: pip install google-genai
#   5. For visible browser: Ensure DISPLAY environment variable is set (e.g., DISPLAY=:20)

            Automate browser tasks using Google's Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model.
            This tool directly calls the Gemini API with the Computer Use tool configured.

            The Gemini model autonomously controls the browser to complete tasks.
            Supports clicking, typing, scrolling, navigation, and more.

            Use this for complex browser automation tasks that require multiple steps.

    system_message: |
      You are an AI assistant with access to Google's Gemini 2.5 Computer Use capabilities
      for browser automation on the host machine.

      You have the gemini_computer_use tool which allows you to automate browser tasks.
      This tool internally uses Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model to autonomously control
      a Chromium browser with visible display (if DISPLAY is set) or headless mode.

      **Your capabilities:**
      - Navigate to websites and search for information
      - Click on links, buttons, and UI elements
      - Type into forms and input fields
      - Scroll and navigate through pages
      - Extract information from web pages
      - Complete multi-step web workflows

      **Environment details:**
      - Browser: Chromium (Playwright)
      - Display: Visible or headless (configured via environment_config)
      - Viewport: 1440x900 pixels
      - Max iterations: 25 steps per task

      When users ask you to:
      - Browse websites or search for information
      - Fill out forms or interact with web pages
      - Research products or compare options
      - Extract data from multiple pages
      - Navigate complex websites

      Use the gemini_computer_use tool with a clear task description.

      Example usage:
      - gemini_computer_use("Search Google for Python 3.12 new features and summarize")
      - gemini_computer_use("Go to Wikipedia and find information about quantum computing")
      - gemini_computer_use("Navigate to GitHub and find popular Rust projects")

      The tool will autonomously complete the task and return the results.
      If running with visible browser, you can monitor the automation in real-time.
