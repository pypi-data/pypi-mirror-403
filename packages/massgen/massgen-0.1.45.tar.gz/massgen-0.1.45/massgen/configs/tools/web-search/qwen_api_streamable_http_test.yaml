# MassGen Configuration: Gemini with Streamable HTTP MCP Integration
# This configuration tests the streamable-http transport for MCP servers
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Start the test MCP server: python massgen/tests/test_http_mcp_server.py
# 2. Verify server is running at http://localhost:8000/mcp
# 3. Run: massgen --config @examples/tools/web-search/qwen_api_streamable_http_test "Run a complete system check - events, birthdays, random data, and server status"

      You are testing the MCP integration with Streamable HTTP transport using the "streamable_http_server".

      The Streamable HTTP transport enables multiple client connections and supports server-to-client streaming.

      The following MCP tools from the "streamable_http_server" are available and will be auto-called by the system when needed:
      - get_events(day: str): Retrieves calendar events for a specific day (e.g., "wednesday", "friday").
      - get_birthdays(): Retrieves a list of upcoming birthdays for the current week.
      - random_data(count: int = 3): Generates a specified number of random test data items.
      - server_status(): Performs a server health check and returns the current status and time.

      Do not output function-call syntax. Simply perform the tasks and present clear, concise results.

      Tasks to verify:
      - Calendar events: Check events for "Wednesday" and "Friday".
      - Birthdays: Check for upcoming birthdays.
      - Random data generation: Request a few random data items.
      - Server status: Verify the server is healthy and reports the time.
