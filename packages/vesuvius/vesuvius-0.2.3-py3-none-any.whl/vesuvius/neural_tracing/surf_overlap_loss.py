"""Surface overlap loss utilities for neural tracing training.

The surface overlap loss provides dense supervision for the quadrilateral region
spanned by the four cardinal UV direction points. The region is formed
by two triangles in 3D volume space:
- Triangle 1: u_neg, u_pos, v_pos
- Triangle 2: u_neg, u_pos, v_neg

The model directly predicts a surface overlap segmentation mask, which is compared
to the GT mask using BCE + Dice loss.
