# This script will build and activate the cuTensorNet MPI interface.
# It requires a GNU C compiler (gcc).
#
# Please check/set the following environment variables:
#  - $CUDA_PATH = Path to your CUDA installation directory.
#  - $MPI_PATH = Path to your MPI library installation directory.
#                If your MPI library is installed in system
#                directories as opposed to its own (root) directory,
#                ${MPI_PATH}/include is expected to contain the mpi.h header.
#                ${MPI_PATH}/lib64 or ${MPI_PATH}/lib is expected to contain libmpi.so.
#
# Run (inside this directory): source ./activate_mpi.sh

# Libraries to be linked with your application (dynamically or statically):
#  libcutensornet, libcutensor, libcusolver, libcublasLt, libmpi, libcudart, libdl

# This script exports an environment variable $CUTENSORNET_COMM_LIB (below).
# This environment variable is mandatory for enabling distributed execution.
# You should add it to your ~/.bashrc file.
