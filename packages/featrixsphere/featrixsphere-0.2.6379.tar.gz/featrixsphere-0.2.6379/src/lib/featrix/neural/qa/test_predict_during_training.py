"""
Test predictions during training.

This test verifies that predictions can be made while a single predictor
is still training, using intermediate checkpoints.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Must be run on a Featrix node machine (needs access to /sphere/app)
- Requires a trained embedding space session
- Creates a new single predictor training job

USAGE:
    python3 test_predict_during_training.py <foundation_session_id> <target_column>
    
Example:
    python3 test_predict_during_training.py public-alphafreight-mini-8c482fa5-1304-442d-8875-4263d5bf79d6 has_fuel_card_Comdata
