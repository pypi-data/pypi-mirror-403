# ============================================================================
# STUB CLASSES FOR BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
# ============================================================================
# These stub classes exist solely to allow old training checkpoints to be
# loaded successfully. When PyTorch saves a checkpoint using torch.save(),
# it pickles the entire model state, including any StopWatch, Interval, or
# TimedIterator objects that were embedded in the model or training state.
#
# When loading old checkpoints, pickle needs these classes to exist in the
# module namespace to successfully unpickle the saved objects. Without these
# stubs, loading old checkpoints fails with:
#   "Can't get attribute 'StopWatch' on <module 'featrix.neural.stopwatch'>"
#
# These classes are intentionally minimal stubs - they don't implement the
# original functionality since StopWatch is no longer actively used in the
# codebase. They only need to be unpicklable, not functional.
# ============================================================================
