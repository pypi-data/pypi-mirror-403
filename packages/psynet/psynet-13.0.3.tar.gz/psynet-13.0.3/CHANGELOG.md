# CHANGELOG

# [13.0.3](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v13.0.3) Release - 2026-01-29

## Fixed
- Fixed browser "Leave page?" popup appearing at the end of Lucid experiments when redirecting to the recruiter. Added `skip_beforeunload` attribute to Page classes and set it to `True` on `ExecuteFrontEndJS`  (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

# [13.0.2](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v13.0.2) Release - 2026-01-27

## Fixed
- Fixed erroneous participant termination ("user-tried-to-leave") when Unity pages reload during Lucid recruitment. Added `is_unity_page` attribute to Page classes to skip the beforeunload detection for Unity pages (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

# [13.0.1](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v13.0.1) Release - 2026-01-05

## Changed
- Disabled automatic backups (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

## Fixed
- Fixed GitLab CI test failures by moving `pytest-timeout` from optional dev dependencies to main dependencies (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Fixed documentation for `prolific_is_custom_screening` default value (`False` not `True`) (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Fixed translation extraction hanging indefinitely when virtual environment directories are present in the experiment directory. The `_get_py_entries_from_dir()` function now skips hidden directories (starting with `.`) and common virtual environment directory names (`.venv`, `venv`, `.env`, `env`, etc.) to avoid processing thousands of Python library files (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added missing `config_options` parameter in `psynet deploy ssh` command (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Fixed bug in Lucid (CINT) qualifications code (author: Elif Celen, reviewer: Frank Höger)

## Documentation
- Add `gettext` package to installation section (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

# [13.0.0](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v13.0.0) Release - 2025-10-23

## Breaking changes
- In Prolific recruitement the base payment is now subtracted from the bonus (see 'Partial payments in Prolific recruitment' in section 'Added' below)
- Implementations of `test_serial_run_bots` in custom experiments might need to be changed as a result of the new  `BotDriver` class (see section 'Changed' below)

## Added
- Added support for Python 3.13 (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added demo of multiple audio files in one page (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Added `MonitorInformation` class to automatically collect information about the monitors (screen resolution, color depth, model number etc.); refactored `next_button` macro (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added opt-in functionality to leave comments on every PsyNet page (`leave_comments_on_every_page`) (useful for lab or field experiments for experimenters to leave notes) (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added `psynet deploy local` subcommand (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Show audio input device on the monitor (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Support text presentation in `VocabTest` for backward compatibility and rare and foreign scripts (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Forward participants on the Ad page to the timeline if they already exist (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Check if the `page_uuid` is valid and if not tell participants to reload the page (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added support for automatic data backups, which are now enabled by default. These backups are stored, along with other experiment metadata, in a customisable 'artifact storage repository'. By default PsyNet uses a 'local' storage repository located at `~/psynet-data/artifacts` on the experiment server, but this can be optionally changed to an S3 bucket (authors: Pol van Rijn, Peter Harrison; reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added support for automatic experiment notifications via Slack (authors: Pol van Rijn, Peter Harrison; reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added a 'Deployments' dashboard which allows the experimenter to review all studies logged in the artifact storage repository (authors: Pol van Rijn, Peter Harrison; reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added a 'basic data' route which can be used to serve the basic data required for scientific analyses (authors: Pol van Rijn, Peter Harrison; reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added rating scale prompts (`RatingPrompt`, `MultiRatingPrompt`) (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Partial payments in Prolific recruitment (authors: Frank Höger, Peter Harrison; reviewer: Peter Harrison)
  - Added a `screen-out` route to make use of Dallinger's screen out functionality allowing for partial payments to participants who did not complete the whole study, e.g. participants who failed prescreening
  - Added a `partial_payment` test experiment
  - Added an experiment for manually testing Prolific recruiter deployments
- Added reporting of HTTP request time analytics when running tests (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Added new `join_criterion` argument to `Grouper` allowing users to customize whether a group is `SyncGroup` is eligible to be joined (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Added 'Audio Similarity' demo experiment (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- It is now possible to write `expected_trials_per_participant="n_nodes"` and `max_trials_per_participant="n_nodes"`
  in StaticTrialMakers. In such cases, `n_nodes` will be taken as referring to the number of start nodes with which the trial maker was initialized. This is particularly helpful for stimulus sets generated programmatically by listing files in directories. Analogous functionality is available in ChainTrialMakers using the term `n_start_nodes` (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Added adblocker note to 'Are you ready to continue?' message (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Added `psynet.debugger()` for creating breakpoints in VSCode/Cursor (see [docs](https://psynetdev.gitlab.io/PsyNet/experiment_development/development_workflow.html#breakpoints)) (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Added debugger and GitHub Actions configuration files to experiment scripts (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Added `get_timeline` method as an alternative way to specify the experiment timeline (see audio demo for an example). This allows users to put the timeline logic at the beginning of the experiment.py file, enhancing readability (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Added timeout funtionality for some scheduled tasks (author: Peter Harrison)
- Added automatic timeout functionality to the CI tests to help debug stuck tasks (author: Peter Harrison)
- Modules and trial makers now accept callables for the `assets` argument, which is helpful for experiments using local file assets (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Added shell completion for `psynet` commands (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

## Changed
- Simplified the logging output when running `psynet debug local` (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Include _logs.jsonl_ instead of _server.log_ when exporting with `psynet export ssh` (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Allow users to specify a custom path format for storing export data in the `psynet-data` directory (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Reordered dashboard tabs (authors: Pol van Rijn, Peter Harrison; reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Automated tests now use a new `BotDriver` class which simulates participant actions using HTTP requests.
  This makes the simulation more realistic (i.e. more likely to catch bugs) and removes deadlocks
  in parallel testing. However, some implementations of `test_serial_run_bots` have needed to be changed
  as a result, and this could apply also to experiments with custom implementations of this method (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Added `pre_deploy_constant`, a mechanism for specifying constants that are computed once in the pre-deploy phase (i.e. on the experimenter's local machine), with this value then propagating to the deployed web app (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- `AudioPrompt` has had the default play control label renamed from 'Play from start' to just 'Play' (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Improved the landing page that users are shown when they navigate to the experiment's base URL (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Updated `audio_stimulus_set_from_dir` functionality to support lazy evaluation and hence work better for large stimulus sets. See updated documentation for details (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- CI now requires merge requests to provide corresponding entries in CHANGELOG.md (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- `check_dallinger_version` now defaults to `false`, meaning that PsyNet will be less aggressive about version changes in Dallinger (author: Peter Harrison)
- Improved error message for `check_dallinger_version` (author: Peter Harrison)
- Address recent Dallinger changes to `Experiment` initialization (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Renamed the 'Help' button to 'Comment' and removed previous help page text (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Replaced `max_exp_dir_size_in_mb` experiment variable with `EXP_MAX_SIZE_MB` environment variable (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- `dallinger_recommended_version` now only specifies the minor Dallinger version (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

## Fixed
- Pin dominate to version 2.9.1; monkey patch `dominate.dom_tag.get_event_loop` (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Separate creators and raters in GAP experiments (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed downloading assets via copying when exporting a local experiment (if the experiment is already down, you cannot download the assets from the URL) (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Fixed a bug where `check_dallinger_version` would freeze forever in automated tests if the versions were mismatched (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Updated database transaction code to use `dallinger.db.sessions_scope` and thereby avoid unintended long-lived database sessions that can lead to performance issues including deadlocks (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed bug where `cache` argument was ignored in `asset()` calls (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Added missing `time_estimate` parameter passed from `Consent`s when creating respective `ConsentPage`s (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Fixed bug in `run_pre_checks` when executing `psynet deploy ssh` (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Renamed `_local` method to `_run_local` in _command_line.py_ to avoid accidental name clashes (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Made the `SurveyJSControl`'s style more consistent with PsyNet (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Made `current_trial` accessor more robust (avoids `current_trial is None` problems by retrying the database query) (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed bug in junit.xml merging in CI (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- CI now does not terminate early on test failure (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed stochastic bug in vocabulary test (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Temporary files like `.deploy` and `source_code.zip` are now cleaned up after `psynet` commands (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed a problem with the ad HTML template, which prevented users from trialling experiments in GitHub Codespaces (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed bugs in `psynet simulate`. (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed a few bugs that were causing `MediaSliderControl` to fail to initialize properly in some cases (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Improved Chrome driver management in pytest_psynet.py (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed layout jumping bug in `SurveyJSControl` (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Removed `Trial.contents` setter/getter which was causing problems with upcoming Dallinger dashboard changes (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed bug in `in_deployment_package` helper function (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed bug in pgbadger workflow in CI (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed bug in JSSynth stopAllAudio that was in some cases preventing the JSSynth from playing at all (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Raja Marjieh)
- Fixed bug in `get_authenticated_session` that occasionally caused tests to fail with 'Connection reset by peer' errors (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed logic when deploying from archive by making sure `Experiment.pre_deploy` gets called omitting database generation and asset uploading while still creating the source code zip file (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Deleted _static/assets_ directory to exclude assets from the source code zip file (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

## Updated
- Updated Dallinger to version 11.3.1. This specific patch version (temporarily) disables `scheduled_job` `async_recruiter_status_check` as it is causing database deadlocks. Read about the changes in Dallinger at https://github.com/Dallinger/Dallinger/releases/tag/v11.3.0 and https://github.com/Dallinger/Dallinger/releases/tag/v11.3.1 (author: Frank Höger)

# [12.0.0](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v12.0.0) Release - 2025-03-20

## Fixed
- Removed dash separator for release candidate and alpha versions (author: Frank Höger)
- Added `supports_delayed_publishing = True` to `BaseLucidRecruiter` (authors: Pol van Rijn, Frank Höger)
- Fixed `specified_using_version` for release candidates (author: Frank Höger)

- Added test to make sure that demos specify the correct version of Dallinger in constraints.txt (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)

## Changed
- Switched to alpha versions instead of development versions in the `master` branch (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Changed the `psynet` requirement to use PsyNet's `master` branch and the `master` Docker image in the `master` branch when being on an alpha version (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Updated logic for replacing the PsyNet Docker image tag when updating demo and test experiments (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Set `SKIP_CHECK_PSYNET_VERSION_REQUIREMENT=1` before running `psynet check-constraints` in a local Docker environment (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

# [12.0.0rc2](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v12.0.0rc2) Release candidate - 2025-02-27

## Fixed
- Previously, PsyNet would never translate anything if the experiment was not completely loaded (in order to access the config var `locale`). However, there is no need to wait for this if a user manually passes `locale` as an argument (authors: Pol van Rijn, Peter Harrison)
- Fixed a bug where `check_versions` failed when a release candidate version, e.g. `psynet==12.0.0rc1`, was specified in requirements.txt (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

## Added
- Added 'Beep headphone test' to check if people can listen to audio but you don't care that much about the quality of the playback device (authors: Pol van Rijn, Peter Harrison)
- Added translations for 75 languages (authors: Pol van Rijn, Peter Harrison)

## Changed
- Consent verification (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger):
  - PsyNet now only forces experiments to contain consent pages during deploying, not during debugging.
  - Demos no longer include `NoConsent` in their timelines.
  - Demos no longer include `SuccessfulEndPage` at the end of the timeline, since this no longer needs to be added explicitly.
- Changed default value of config variable `is_custom_screening` to `False` (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

## Updated
- Updated Dallinger to version 11.1.1. Read about changes in Dallinger: https://github.com/Dallinger/Dallinger/releases/tag/v11.1.1 (author: Frank Höger)

# [12.0.0rc1](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v12.0.0rc1) Release candidate - 2025-02-15

## Fixed
- Fixed bug that prevent the export command from being run (author: Frank Höger)

## Changed
- Removed hyphen from release candidate and development versions (author: Frank Höger)

# [12.0.0rc0](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v12.0.0-rc0) Release candidate - 2025-02-12

## Added
- The new `psynet translate` command generates translations for the current directory (e.g. an experiment or a package). By default these translations are generated using OpenAI's ChatGPT but Google Translate is also supported. API tokens are needed in both case (authors: Pol van Rijn, Peter Harrison)
  - If you want to use a translator with context, you can write this instead:

  ```py
  _ = get_translator(context=True)
  InfoPage(_("welcome page", "Welcome to the experiment!"), time_estimate=5)
  ```

  - Changing locales during the experiment is no longer supported (support before was patchy anyway).
  - PsyNet will now throw an error if you try to debug an experiment with missing translations. You will need to generate these with `psynet translate`. It will require valid translations for all locales specified in `supported_locales`. If this is not set, it falls back to the experiment `locale`.
  - Various `ModularPage`, `TrialMaker`, etc classes no longer accept a `locale` argument or attribute.

  #### Other translation related changes
  - Translation documentation has been simplified and extended
  - The config variable `language` has been renamed to `locale`

- Added `asset` helper function for creating assets. This now can be used instead of the confusing variety of Asset subclasses, e.g. `ExperimentAsset`, `CachedAsset`, `CachedFunctionAsset`, etc. For example (author: Peter Harrison; reviewer: Frank Höger):

```py
asset("audio.wav")
asset("audio.wav", cache=True)
asset(synthesize_sine_wav, arguments: {"frequency": 440})
asset("https://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket/audio.mp3")

## Breaking changes
- The `get_translator` interface has been simplified. It now returns a single translator, `gettext`, commonly abbreviated to `_`. Locale, and namespace (previously called 'module') are inferred automatically from the context. This means you can mark translations as simply as this:

```py
_ = get_translator()
InfoPage(_("Welcome to the experiment!"), time_estimate=5)
```

- Added documentation for the Dallinger `publish_experiment` config variable to indicate if the experiment should be also published when deploying. In the case of Prolific recruitment, if `False` a draft study will be created which later can be published via the Prolific web UI; in the case of Lucid recruitment, if `False` an awarded survey will be created which later can be published (set 'live') via the Lucid web UI. Default: `True` (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Added a Dallinger config variable `disable_browser_autotranslate` to turn on or off autotranslate. In Dallinger the default is off, in psynet the default is on (i.e. block automatic translation) (author: Pol van Rijn, Peter Harrison)
- Added interactive option to disable Dallinger version check (authors: Peter Harrison; reviewer: Pol van Rijn)

## Changed
- Removed exact pinning of the Dallinger version by allowing (again) any greater minor version (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Introduced `dallinger_recommended_version` variable and replaced environment variable `SKIP_CHECK_DALLINGER_VERSION` with config variable `check_dallinger_version` to allow for flexibility, e.g. when deploying `Dallinger` development branches. When set to `False` PsyNet bypasses the check for the version of Dallinger that is recommended for the current PsyNet release. Default: `True` (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Moved `mock` package from optional-dependencies to dependencies in _pyproject.toml_ (author: Frank Höger).

## Removed
- Removed unneeded dependency `pybabel` which crashed CI (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Removed `--open-recruitment` config variable; removed `--open-recruitment` flag from deploy commands (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

## Updated
- Updated Dallinger to version 11.1.0. Read about changes in Dallinger: https://github.com/Dallinger/Dallinger/releases/tag/v11.1.0 (author: Frank Höger).
- Improved asset documentation (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Updated demos to use the `asset` helper function (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).

# [11.9.1](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v11.9.1) Release - 2025-03-07

## Fixed
- Fixed Dallinger version in the constraints.txt files of demo and test experiments (author: Frank Höger).
- Moved mock package from optional-dependencies to dependencies in pyproject.toml (author: Frank Höger).

# [11.9.0](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v11.9.0) Release - 2025-01-16

## Fixed
- Fixed construction of download source URL in `_export_source_code` (author: Peter Harrison).
- Removed `client_ip_address` from anonymous data export (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

## Added
- Added support for depositing folder assets to SSH deployments/debugging (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Allow release candidate tags in requirements.txt files (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- It is now possible to provide functions directly to the timeline and they will be interpreted as code blocks (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Added `--open-recruitment` flag for `psynet deploy ssh|heroku` deployments (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

## Changed
- Improved deploy logic (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison):
  - Renamed config variable `activate_recruiter_on_start` to `open_recruitment`
  - Allow config variable `open_recruitment=False` to be overridden by using the `--open-recruitment` flag. Specifically, following logic now applies with respect to recruiters:
    - `psynet deploy ssh` (Prolific): creates a draft study but will wait for you to launch it manually from the Prolific web GUI
    - `psynet deploy ssh` (MTurk): fails and tells you to add the `--open-recruitment` flag
    - `psynet deploy ssh` (Lucid): creates a draft Lucid survey
    - `psynet deploy ssh --open-recruitment` (Prolific): creates and publishes the Prolific study
    - `psynet deploy ssh --open-recruitment` (MTurk): creates and publishes the MTurk HIT
    - `psynet deploy ssh --open-recruitment` (Lucid): creates a live Lucid survey
- Renamed `server_option` to `option_server` in _dallinger.command_line.docker_ssh_ for Dallinger 11 compatibility (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

## Removed
- Removed obsolete _deploy.sh_ files in demos/tests (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

## Updated
- Updated Dallinger to version 11.0.1. Read about changes in Dallinger, e.g. the addition of new config variables `prolific_workspace` and `prolific_project` to support declaration of Prolific workspaces and project names: https://github.com/Dallinger/Dallinger/releases/tag/v11.0.1 (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

#### Documentation changes
- Added new section for setting up a physical server (author: Peter Harrison).

# [11.8.0](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v11.8.0) Release 2024-11-05

## Fixed

- Fixed importing of `get_experiment` in lucid.py (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Fixed bug whereby `GibbsTrial` was causing an export error if no answer had been submitted (author: Eline Van Geert, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Fixed rendering condition for markupsafe v3 (author: Frank Höger).
- Fixed bug in `get_folder_size_mb` (it was ignoring subdirectories) (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).

# [11.5.0](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v11.5.0) Release 2024-06-07

## Fixed
- Fixed a couple of image rendering bugs that manifested when using SVG files with `GraphicPrompt`/`GraphicControl` (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Fixed various issues and improvements/additions for Lucid recruitment (authors: Pol van Rijn, Frank Höger; reviewer: Peter Harrison):
  - Added `initial_response_within_s` setting; if a participant does not proceed to the consent within a certain time (default 180 seconds), the participant is terminated via the backend-end.
  - Added a Lucid tab in the dashboard displaying various data and statistics, e.g.
    - Lucid respondents activity, incl. a detailed breakdown of their status

  - Cleanup integration of external libraries (bootstrap, bootstrap-select, d3)
- Fixed race condition in `nextPage` which manifested on graphics pages when double-clicking on a response (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- The `nodes` argument in `StaticTrialMaker` can now be a callable. This is helpful for referring to local files that are not part of the experiment directory, which we don't want the remote server to try to access (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Fixed bug in `render_error` (variables sometimes accessed before assignment) (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).

## Added
- Added `require_requirements_txt` decorator for `psynet generate-constraints` and `psynet check-constraints` commands (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

## Changed
- Restructured demo directories (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison):
  - Moved demos into respective new subdirectories `demos/experiments` and `demos/features`.
    **Note: if you are using a local editable version of PsyNet, we recommend deleting it and creating a fresh clone so that the old directories are purged properly.**
  - Moved demos that are only used for testing into `tests /experiments`.
  - Moved a part of the tests into respective new subdirectories `tests/isolated/demos`, `tests/isolated/experiments` and `tests/isolated/features`.
  - Renamed and updated `list_demo_dirs` to `list_experiment_dirs` functions to reflect the new directory structure.

# [11.4.0](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v11.4.0) Release 2024-05-25

## Fixed
- Avoid throwing an `NotImplementedError` if accidentally multiple trials are made; only propagate the answer of the first trial and fail other remaining trials (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Fixed bug where progress bar would behave strangely when timeline constructs ended up delivering an unexpected amount of time reward. This bug was most salient in trial makers when `expected_trials_per_participant` was specified inaccurately (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Removed `require_exp_directory` decorator for `psynet check-constraints` and `psynet generate-constraints` which was causing Docker builds to fail (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

## Changed
- `participant.time_credit` is now represented as a float rather than as an object of class `TimeCreditStore` (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Renamed `fix_time` to `with_fixed_time_credit`. As a reminder, this function ensures that a given portion of
  the timeline always delivers a specified amount of time credit once completed, irrespective of how many
  pages/trials the participant consumes in that region (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).

# [11.3.1](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v11.3.1) Release 2024-05-17

# [11.3.0](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v11.3.0) Release 2024-05-09

## Added
- Added `psynet.timeline.sequence`, a utility function for administering a selection of test elements in
  a customizable order for different participants (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Added new attribute `network.participants` to access all participants in a network (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Automatically register recruiters when importing `psynet` (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

- Minor updates/fixes to graph.py (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Raja Marjieh).
- Check if the current working directory is an experiment directory before continuing running PsyNet commands (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Added logic to export a deployed experiment's source code (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Check if any TODOs are still present in experiment files; if 'yes' experiment deployment will be stopped. This check can be skipped by setting environment variable `SKIP_TODO_CHECK=1` (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

## Fixed
- Fixed bug in `psynet.timeline.randomize`; it now works properly for more complex elements such as trial makers (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Fixed md5sum in demos' constraints.txt files generated by demos/update_demos.py (author: Frank Höger).
- Retrieve user's home path on the remote SSH server dynamically via SSH

## Changed
- `recode_wav` no longer uses Parselmouth but instead uses soundfile (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Changed default for `max_trials_per_participant` to `NoArgumentProvided` and throw a deprecation warning when it is left unchanged. To preserve old behavior, we still interpret `NoArgumentProvided` as if it were `None` (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

## Deprecated
- `max_trials_per_participant` not being set explicitly (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

#### Documentation changes
- Updated AWS server setup (author: Peter Harrison).

#### Fixed
- Streamlined PsyNet's dependencies to reduce the installation of unnecessary packages (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Fixed broken API documentation in previous v11.1.0 release.

# [11.2.0](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v11.2.0) Release 2024-03-27

#### Fixed
- Fixed bug whereby `parent_trial` relationship was not updating properly (author: Peter Harrison).
- `SKIP_CHECK_DALLINGER_VERSION` is now propagated properly to Docker containers (author: Peter Harrison).

#### Added
- Track loading times in new `Request` table (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Track experiment status over time (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Show change of experiment status over time in the dashboard (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

#### Changed
- `psynet destroy ssh` can now receive app arguments to destroy multiple apps at once; by default it's not asking to expire HITs, but it's now an optional parameter (author: Pol van Rijn, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

#### Improved
- Made `network.degree` more efficient (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).

#### Documentation changes
- Updated Prolific documentation (author: Peter Harrison).
- Added section `Connecting to the database via SSH` (author: Peter Harrison).

# [11.1.0](https://gitlab.com/PsyNetDev/PsyNet/-/releases/v11.1.0) Release 2024-03-05

#### Fixed
- Improved efficiency of `find_networks` (loading `network.head` in a subquery as part of the initial networks retrieval) (author: Peter Harrison).
- Fixed Chrome and ChromeDriver download link in Dockerfile (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- PsyNet now throws an error if an experiment still uses the old trial maker method `compute_bonus` (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Fixed bug in version check (previously it would fail when requirements.txt files included `.git` extensions) (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).

#### Added
- Added a `batch_zipped` parameter to `MediaGibbsNode`. If `batch_zipped` is True, the batch file including the media for the Gibbs slider will be saved as a compressed .zip folder including the .batch file. This zipped batch can be beneficial when media to load are heavy files, as only the smaller .zip folder needs to be downloaded on the participant's computer. The .zip folder is then unpacked only there, avoiding the need for downloading the heavy uncompressed batch file. For heavy media files, the zipped batch option will thus decrease page loading times for the MediaGibbs trials. (author: Eline Van Geert, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added an svg Gibbs demo using a zipped batch file: svg_gibbs_zipped (author: Eline Van Geert, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added an `unzip` property to media definition in `MediaGibbsTrial` (author: Eline Van Geert, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added new config variable `big_base_payment` which defaults to `False` (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Added assertion which stops startup of an experiment if `base_payment > 20` and `big_base_payment = true` is NOT set (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Added assertion logging a warning message if `base_payment > 10` (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Added cap-recruiter section to experiment config template (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Added `with_for_update` option to various queries to make sure that appropriate locks are made on queries. This should reduce the number of deadlock errors we observe (author: Peter Harrison).
- Added missing library licenses (author: Peter Harrison).

#### Changed
- Changed `preloadBatch` to also work with a zipped batch file (author: Eline Van Geert, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Changed default `fix_time_credit` in `conditional`, `switch`, and `GroupBarrier` constructs to `False`. This means that (unlike before) the time credit will vary according to which branch the participant takes, which we think is more expected behavior. Default `fix_time_credit` remains `True` for `while_loop`, providing a protection against situations where the participant spends infinite time in a loop and gets infinite credit. We may address this behavior differently in the future. (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- `grow_networks` now happens in a periodic background process to avoid deadlock errors and improve robustness (author: Peter Harrison).
- Barrier logic now happens in a periodic background process to avoid deadlock errors and improve robustness (author: Peter Harrison).
- SQLAlchemy performance improvements (author: Peter Harrison):
  - Substantial improvements in database usage efficiency, which should manifest in faster page response times. Efficiency of asset usage is now much improved: it is now practical to start an experiment with e.g. 100,000 assets.
  - PsyNet has now moved on from its 'commit all the time' strategy. Now the strategy is instead to have just one commit at the end of a given HTTP response or at the end of a given asynchronous process.
  - If a participant waits more than 60 s for PsyNet to prepare their next trial then their session will be terminated
  under the assumption that some error has occurred. This timeout is customizable via the attribute `TrialMaker.max_time_waiting_for_trial`.
  - `AsyncProcesses` no longer start immediately, but instead start when the database transaction is committed.
  - `awaiting_async_process` has been removed.
  - Eliminated nested pytest calls, which were preventing some important error messages (particularly those in asynchronous processes) from being logged.

#### Updated
- Updated `Dallinger` to `v10.0.1`. See the complete release notes at https://github.com/Dallinger/Dallinger/releases/tag/v10.0.1.
- Updated pyproject.toml (added `dallinger[docker]`, `pytest`)
- Updated PsyNet to support Python 3.12 (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Updated GitLab CI to use Python 3.12.2 image (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

#### Documentation changes
- Installation (general, developer, Docker, virtual environment) (author: Peter Harrison).
- Fix warnings when building documentation (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Fix broken internal links (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

- Renamed `psynet` to `PsyNet` in .gitlab-ci.yml (author: Frank Höger).
- Removed failing detection of `editable mode` in `psynet update` command (author: Frank Höger).

#### Added
- Added `utils.get_experiment`, an easy way to get an `Experiment` instance from an arbitrary part of your code (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Pol van Rijn).
- Added the ability to customize the SQLAlchemy polymorphic identity of a given class by setting the `polymorphic_identity` attribute in the class definition (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Pol van Rijn).
- Added new tools for creating bots in PsyNet. Bots are artificially simulated participants that progress through the experiment in much the same way as ordinary PsyNet participants, with the exception that they never interact with the web browser itself, but instead interact with the Python objects that underlie the timeline. Bots can be used for creating tests for PsyNet experiments, for simulating emergent network dynamics, or for introducing controllable characters into the actual experiment deployment (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Pol van Rijn):

A bot is created with a command like the following:

``` py
from psynet.bot import Bot

bot = Bot()
```

At this point you can set custom variables within that bot object, for example to correspond to relevant participant parameters such as gender or musicianship. You might do this deterministically or stochastically, depending on your interest.

```py
import random

bot.var.gender = "female"
bot.var.is_musician = random.sample([True, False], 1][0]
```

You can also define a universal bot initialization method on the Experiment class, like this:

``` py
class Exp(...):
    def initialize_bot(self, bot):
        bot.var.is_musician = random.sample([True, False], 1)[0]
```

This method will be called automatically whenever a bot is initialized.

PsyNet needs to be told how bots respond to particular pages. This can be done in two ways.

The first way is to pass a `bot_response` function to the Page or Control constructor. For example:

```py
ModularPage(
    "How many years of musical training do you have?",
    TextControl(
        ...
        bot_response=lambda bot: 10 if bot.var.is_musician else 0,
    )
)
```

This `bot_response` can take various other parameters, including the `experiment`, the `page`, and the `prompt`, so that you have all the information you need to define the bot's response.

Alternatively, if you are defining a custom Page or Control class, you can define a custom `get_bot_response` method, which achieves much the same response.

To tell the bot to progress through the experiment, you can use one of two functions: `take_page` and `take_experiment`. The first advances by just one page, whereas the latter progresses through the experiment. The speed of advancement can be determined by a parameter that acts as a multiplier on each page's `time_estimate` value.

There are various ways to configure bots to take part in a real experiment. One of the easiest currently is to define a scheduled task that occurs periodically in the background of the experiment and runs a bot participant.

```py
    @staticmethod
    @scheduled_task("interval", seconds=5, max_instances=1)
    def run_bot_participant():
        # Every 5 seconds, runs a bot participant.
        experiment = get_experiment()
        if experiment.var.launched:
            bot = Bot()
            bot.take_experiment()
```
- Added `psynet generate-constraints` to command line (author: Frank Höger; reviewer: Peter Harrison).

#### Updated
- Updated `Dallinger` to `v9.2.0` adding experimental support for Docker deployment. See the complete release notes at https://github.com/Dallinger/Dallinger/releases/tag/v9.2.0.

# [9.1.2] Released on 2022-08-13

#### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that caused incorrect participant details in error messages (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).

# [9.1.1] Released on 2022-08-03

#### Fixed
- Fixed a bug that introduced import errors for experiments containing stimulus sets (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).

# [9.1.0] Released on 2022-07-11

#### Added
- Added PsyNetRecruiter base class passing down the missing `notify_duration_exceeded` method to `BaseLucidRecruiter`. (author: Frank Höger; reviewer: Peter Harrison)

#### Fixed
- Fixed further issues with database tables not being exported properly. (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)

#### Changed
- Prevent opening a new window when clicking on the `Begin Experiment` button on the Ad page when using `LucidRecruiter`. (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Register `cap_recruiter_auth_token` config variable; cleanup CAP-Recruiter demo. (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Changed fields of the `LucidRIDs` database table: Removed fields `failed`, `failed_reason`, and `time_of_death`; added field `termination_requested_at`.
 `termination_requested_at` is now set each time a termination request is made to Lucid Marketplace. (author: Frank Höger; reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Ensure that `Exp.setup()` only happens in the once, in the launch routine. (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)

# [9.0.1] Released on 2022-07-08

#### Added
- Added more comprehensive tests for data export. (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)

#### Fixed
- Fixed problem where not all database tables were being exported. (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Fixed problem where two 'ExperimentConfig' database objects were being created. (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)

#### Changed
- PsyNet now just exports data as CSV files, not JSON files; doing both seemed redundant. (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- PsyNet's exported CSV files now correspond directly to the class names of the exported objects,
  without any automatic conversion from CamelCase to snake_case. This seems more transparent and less error-prone. (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)

# [9.0.0] Released on 2022-06-17

#### Breaking changes
- The URL format for PsyNet experiments is now a bit cleaner, looking something like this:
  `http://127.0.0.1:5000/timeline?participant_id=1&auth_token=63252608-ee35-40cc-89be-9bbb82120c5d`
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).

#### Fixed
- Fixed bug in `cls.inherits_table` (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Fixed bug in `openwindow` JavaScript function in `ad.html` which prevented propagation
  of Prolific specific URL parameters (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Refreshing the first page of the experiment no longer causes an error,
  as the participant's authentication token is now loaded automatically into the URL
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Patched unreliable behavior in `dallinger.identity.participantId`
  (author: Peter Harrison; reviewer: Frank Höger).

#### Added
- Added explicit support for `dict` and `list` types in `claim_field`; importantly, these now provide
  mutation tracking, so that in-place modifications to these fields will be picked up properly
  by SQLAlchemy (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Added demos for `Prolific` and `CAP-Recruiter` recruitment (author: Frank Höger).
- Added Unity autoplay demo test (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

#### Changed

- Updated the Unity C# code to adapt to the new URL format (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Ofer Tchernichovski).
- `PageMaker` has been made much more flexible. Instead of being constrained to
  returning just one page, they may now return pretty much any kind of
  (arbitrarily nested) logic. This flexibility likewise now applies to `show_trial`
  and `show_feedback` (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- It is no longer required to specify `num_pages` or `check_num_pages` when defining a custom `Trial` class,
  and such specifications will be ignored (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- `participant.elt_id` now takes a different form. Instead of comprising a single integer, it now
  corresponds to a list of integers, which index into nested page makers of arbitrary depth.
  This should not affect most PsyNet users directly (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Made the test suite more scalable by splitting the single job which ran all tests into multiple (5) smaller jobs
  that run in parallel.The overall time to run the tests was thereby reduced from ~18 min. to ~8 min
  (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).
- Renamed the PsyNet base layout template to `psynet_layout.html` (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger).
- Prevented opening a new window when clicking on the `Begin Experiment` button on the Ad page
  when using `LucidRecruiter` (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison).

  Includes a bugfix which adds `clock` support in Docker.
  (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Update Google Chrome and driver to version 101.x in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
  (author: Frank Höger)

# [7.2.0] Released on 2022-05-16

#### Fixed
- Fixed broken loop in `AudioPrompt` when `controls=False`
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- More aggressive DB commits in `finalize_trial`
  (author: Peter Harrison)
- More robust jsonification in data export
  (author: Peter Harrison)
- Remove unintended timeout behavior from `run_subprocess_with_live_output`
  (author: Peter Harrison)
- Fixed participant resuming via the dashboard, which was broken by the introduction of the `auth_token`
  functionality.
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)

#### Added
- Added LUCID Marketplace recruiting integration:
  * Added `DevLucidRecruiter` and `LucidRecruiter` classes.
  * Added HTML templates for final pages for the three cases 'successful', 'unsuccessful',
    and 'rejected consent').
  * Added LUCID recruiting demo.
  NOTE: Currently only to be used in conjunction with Dallinger branch `docker-clock`.
  (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Added `failure_tags` to `RejectedConsentPage`; added `failed_reason` to data returned from
  `BaseCapRecruiter`'s `reward_bonus` method.
  (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)
- Notify the CAP-Recruiter API when a participant has failed.
  (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

#### Changed
- Replaced deprecated MTurk consents in demos with new consents `AudiovisualConsent` and `MainConsent`.
  (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

# [7.1.0] Released on 2022-04-25

#### Fixed
- Fixed developer mode by calling reset_console
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)

- Fixed an error which occasionally happened when PsyNet tried to close down zombie processes,
  when the process would close itself before PsyNet managed to close it, causing a
  psutil.NoProcessFound error. Now such errors are ignored. The implementation uses a new function
  called psynet.command_line.safely_kill_process.
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Pol van Rijn)

- Fixed Unity demo by replacing it with a new autoplay version containing updated WebGL files.
  (author: Ofer Tchernichovski, reviewers: Peter Harrison, Frank Höger)

#### Added
- PsyNet now supports the definition of custom SQL classes that are not subclasses of pre-existing
  PsyNet/Dallinger objects.
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Pol van Rijn)

  These objects are stored in their own tables and can be seen in the dashboard. The API is very simple:

  ```py
  from psynet.data import SQLBase, SQLMixin, register_table

  @register_table
  class Bird(SQLBase, SQLMixin):
      __tablename__ = "bird"

  class Sparrow(Bird):
      pass

  class Robin(Bird):
      pass
  ```

  The above example defines a new database table called 'bird', in which we can store robins and sparrows.

- Added new demos custom_table_simple and custom_table_complex that illustrate sqlalchemy usage via this new PsyNet feature.
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Pol van Rijn)
- Added a new, more robust version of init_db for resetting database state: psynet.data.init_db
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Pol van Rijn)
- Added auth_token and authToken to be used by the Unity API.
  (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

#### Changed
- Changed the visual behavior of the five consent pages recently introduced by always showing the buttons at the bottom of the pages and making the text overall smaller.
  (author: Frank Höger, reviewer: Peter Harrison)

# [7.0.0] Released on 2022-03-27

#### Fixed
- Fixed problem in `auth_token` verification for JS logging.
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)

  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Bugfix in imitation chain demo.
  (author: Peter Harrison)
- Fixed out-of-date dependency in PsyNet timeline demos.
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)

  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)

#### Added
- Added `start_trial_automatically` option to PsyNet pages (`default=True`), which can be used e.g. to disable autoplay for audio.
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)

#### Changed
- Remove time estimate text in new consents.
  (author: Frank Höger)
- Increase timeout in regression tests.
  (author: Peter Harrison)
- Set default number of threads to 1 in `psynet debug`, which saves about a second off the start-up time.
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Optimised some import logic to improve import times. This should become particularly relevant once a
  pending Dallinger pull request is merged.
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- PsyNet now detects and kills old Heroku and Chrome sessions before starting a new debug session.

- Disabled `check_participant_opened_devtools` by default; detecting participants opening developer tools
seems to be unstable, so experimenters should only enable this check at their own risk.
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- Updated the categories in the dashboard database table to make more sense with PsyNet objects (e.g. replacing Infos with Trials).
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- The regression test fixtures have been updated with the goal of fixing recent problems with test unreliability.
  (author: Peter Harrison, reviewer: Frank Höger)
- `psynet debug` now provides hot-refresh functionality by default. This means that you can edit the experiment code and see your changes without relaunching the experiment, simply instead refreshing your web browser. This can be disabled by passing the `--legacy` option to `psynet debug`.

# [5.2.0] Released on 2022-01-21

#### Fixed
- Fixed `psynet export` failure for large databases.
- Temporary fix for missing `time_taken` in `UnityPage` response's metadata.
- Fixed breaking changes of new `time_estiamte` in demo `imitation_chain`.
- Improved the error message for duplicated module IDs.

#### Added
- Added a new parameter `fail_on_timeout` (default = `True`) to `wait_while`;
  if this is set to `False`, the participant is no longer failed once the
  `max_wait_time` is exceeded, but instead continues with the experiment.
- Added `source` and `participant` attributes for `Network` classes.
- Added command-line tool `psynet rpdb`, which is an alias for `nc` allowing
  to easily perform (remote) debugging.
- Added `degree` and `phase` as `export_vars` in `ChainSource`.
- Added `phase` as `export_var` in `ChainNode`.
- Added `degree`, `phase` and `node_id` as `export_vars` in `ChainTrial`.
- Added GitLab merge request template.
- Added `username` attribute to `HelloPrompt`.
- Added regression test for data export.
- Added Monterey installation documentation.

#### Changed
- Link 'Edit in GitLab' button to `master`, not `docs-staging` branch.

# [5.1.0] Released on 2021-11-30

#### Added
- Added 'Edit on GitLab' button to documentation pages.
- Added `FreeTappingRecordTest` to prescreens.

#### Fixed
- Renamed `clickedObject` to `clicked_object` in the graph experiment demo's `format_answer` method.

#### Updated
- Updated Dallinger to v7.8.0.
- Updated google-chrome and chromedriver to v96.x in .gitlab-ci.yml.

# [5.0.2] Released on 2021-11-15

#### Changed
- The time taken by the participant is now stored as a property of the `Trial` object
  (`Trial.time_taken`).
- By default, dynamic updating of progress bar and bonus display now only occurs
  for Unity pages. This makes the logs cleaner for standard PsyNet pages.

#### Fixed
- Updated `get_template` to remove use of deprecated function `read_text`.
- (Re-)Added `jQuery` (v3.6.0) to the HTML head section of timeline-page.html. In Dallinger jQuery
  only gets loaded in the body section which causes a `$ is not defined` JS error when using the
  `AudioRecordControl` in PsyNet.

# [5.0.1] Released on 2021-11-10

#### Fixed
- Fixed regressions in prescreening tasks.
- Fixed demos' constraints.
- Improved changelog notes for v5.0.0.

# [5.0.0] Released on 2021-11-10

#### Added
- Added ability to disable progress bar (`experiment.var.show_progress_bar`).
- Added dallinger version to `psynet --version` output.
- Added `dallinger_version` experiment variable.
- Added audio-forced-choice prescreening task (thanks Pol van Rijn, Harin Lee).

#### Breaking changes
- Refactored JavaScript variable and function names to camelCase,
  and HTML IDs and attributes to kebab-case.
  Experiments referring explicitly to these components may need to be
  updated accordingly.

The time estimation process has been revised in PsyNet, resulting in the following changes:

- Time-based bonuses now work differently for page makers and multi-page makers.
  Instead of allocating bonus according to the (multi-)page maker's `
  time_estimate` attribute, bonuses are now allocated according to the
  `time_estimate` attributes of the page(s) generated by the (multi-)page maker.
  The (multi-)page maker's own `time_estimate` is now only used for time estimation purposes,
  determining for example the progress bar and the predicted experiment duration/bonus
  displayed in the ad. In the case where the generated page(s) is/are missing a time estimate,
  the time estimate from the page maker object will be used instead, as before.
  - As a result of the above improvement, inaccurate `num_pages` attributes in multi-page trials
    no longer cause inaccurate bonus estimations, only inaccurate progress bars. In these cases
    PsyNet now displays a warning message advising the experimenter to set the appropriate
    number of pages, with this appropriate number of pages being displayed on the basis of
    the current run-time evaluation.
- The mechanism for setting the time estimates for trials has now changed.
  Previously such time estimates were specified by passing an argument called
  `time_estimate_per_trial` to the trial maker. This introduced an undesirable
  non-locality to PsyNet implementations, whereby changes to the trial class
  that impacted on time estimation had to be propagated far away to the
  trial maker constructor call, which was easy to forget.
  In the new version, trial time estimates are specified by setting a
  class attribute called `time_estimate` in the custom trial class, for example:

```py
class CustomTrial(Trial):
    time_estimate = 5
```

  An error will be thrown if the user neglects to set this `time_estimate`,
  or if they try to set it via the trial maker.

  To update PsyNet code to follow this new convention, see below.
  Here's an example of what the code might look like before:

```py
class CustomTrial(Trial):
    def show_trial(self, experiment, participant):
        return InfoPage("Hello!", time_estimate=5)

trial_maker = TrialMaker(**params, time_estimate_per_trial=5)
```

The updated code should look like this:

```py
class CustomTrial(Trial):
    time_estimate = 5

    def show_trial(self, experiment, participant):
        return InfoPage("Hello!", time_estimate)

trial_maker = TrialMaker(**params)
```

- New ``Trial`` fields have been added to help keep track of how time credit was assigned for trials:
  ``time_credit_before_trial``, ``time_credit_after_trial``, and ``time_credit_from_trial``.
  If a trial turned out to give an unexpected amount of time credit,
  PsyNet now delivers a warning message and recommends a revised value for ``time_estimate``.

#### Other changes
- PsyNet now supports serialization of arbitrary objects to database fields.
  Serialization is accomplished using `jsonpickle`.
  No change should be necessary to experiment implementations;
  however the underlying database representation for some fields
  will have changed slightly. As a result, it is unlikely to be possible
  to relaunch experiments from zip files using PsyNet >=5.0.0 if the original version
  was deployed on PsyNet <5.0.0.

#### Fixed
- Removed external references to `jQuery` and `platform` JavaScript libraries.
- Specified the version of Dallinger in gitlab-ci.yml.

# [4.2.1] Released on 2021-10-31

#### Fixed
- Implemented fix for networks not growing properly in within-participant experiments
  with asynchronous processing.

# [4.2.0] Released on 2021-10-27

#### Added
- Added new argument 'mirrored' to VideoRecordControl and VideoPrompt allowing
  the video to be displayed as if looking into a mirror.
- Added a button "Abort experiment" to the ad and error page, including two new environment
  variables 'show_abort_button' and 'min_accumulated_bonus_for_abort'. These additions
  make it possible for the experimenter to allow the participant to abort an experiment and
  be compensated automatically given the minimum amount of bonus has already been accumulated.
  The default is to not display the button.

#### Changed
- Replaced the Audio Gibbs demo with an implementation of the emotional prosody
  experiment from our 2020 NeurIPS paper (Harrison et al., 2020)
  (thanks Pol van Rijn!).

# [4.1.0] Released on 2021-10-15

#### Added
- Added new dashboard panel called 'Participant'.
  Here one can search participants by participant ID, worker ID, or assignment ID,
  and easily see the current status of the participant
  as well as their current estimated bonus.
  Functionality is also provided for resuming a given participant's session
  via a special URL.
- Added documentation for the ``compute_bonus`` method.

#### Changed
- Reduced the default performance threshold in `LexTaleTest` from 10 to 8.
  The previous performance threshold was found to be much too stringent.
- Migrated the ``compute_bonus`` method from the ``Experiment`` class to the
  ``Participant`` class. Researchers should not be using this method directly,
  so this change should not affect most people.

#### Fixed
- Fixed ReppMarkersTest

#### Updated
- Updated Dallinger to v7.7.0.

# [4.0.0] Released on 2021-09-13

#### Added
- Added a collection of dense rating paradigms (see `psynet.trial.dense`).
  These are still experimental, but they do have draft documentation.

#### Changed
- Refactored the logic for queueing asynchronous processes, and created a new method
  ``queue_async_method`` that makes it easy to queue asynchronous functions for
  database objects such as networks and trials.
  See the ``async_pruning`` demo for an example.

#### Fixed
- Fixed bug in ``AudioSliderControl`` (renaming of ``wrap`` to ``random_wrap``
  and deletion of ``phase`` arguments not propagated properly).
- The `promptEnd` event of JSSynth is now triggered by `promptStart` rather than `trialStart`.
  This facilitates customization where the JSSynth is triggered multiple times in
  the same trial.

#### Renamed
- Renamed `check_timeout_interval` to `check_timeout_interval_sec`.

#### Breaking changes
- Repeat trials are now constructed in a slightly different way.
  Previously, they were constructed in a way that permitted slight variation
  in surface features between a repeat trial and its originator;
  in the case of GSP, for example, this would mean a different randomized
  starting location for the slider. However, this behavior ended up
  being problematic for extensibility. In the new implementation, repeat
  trials are by default exact clones of their parents.
- `with_trial_maker_namespace` is now changed to remove the leading hyphens
  from trial-maker variables as they are stored in the database.
  This has the consequence that these variables (e.g. performance check results)
  will now be exported directly by `psynet export` into the main CSV files,
  rather than only being available in `db-snapshot`.
  This is a breaking change in that it will not be possible to relaunch
  experiments from zip file that were originally deployed with a
  previous PsyNet version.

# [3.1.0] Released on 2021-08-10

#### Added
- Added `show_footer` experiment variable.
- Added `psynet update` command.

#### Changed
- In the footer, only display detailed bonus (basic + extra) if `performance_bonus` > 0.

#### Fixed
- Fixed display of progress and bonus on Unity pages.
- Fixed wrong `import` documentation.
- Fixed code for black, isort, and flake8.

#### Updated
- Updated Dallinger to v7.6.0.
- Updated singing_iterated and tapping_* demos.

# [3.0.0] Released on 2021-08-03

#### Fixed
- Fixed bug in 'stop' button for `AudioPrompt`.
- Fixed bug when displaying tooltip and module details in dashboard.
- Removed temporary fix for 'assignmenId' from start page.

#### Added
- Added demo of translation workflow (see `demos/translation`).
- Added new iterated singing demo (see `demos/singing_iterated`).
- Added a new type of slider for `SliderControl`: `circular_slider`.
- Added optional `random_wrap` functionality to `SliderControl`.
- Prepared PsyNet for new Docker functionality.
  Note new format of requirements in `requirements.txt`.
  The functionality will be ready-to-use once the Dallinger pull request
  https://github.com/Dallinger/Dallinger/pull/3016 is merged.
- Added `generate_constraints.py` for regenerating constraints for all PsyNet demos.
- Added experimental graph network API.

#### Changed
- Revised implementation for `audio_gibbs_demo`.
- Added more detailed info to the bonus displayed in the footer.

#### Breaking changes

- The API for `ProgressDisplay` and `ProgressStage` has now been improved.
  `ProgressDisplay` no longer takes a `duration` argument, the duration
  is instead computed automatically from the provided `ProgressStage` objects.
  `ProgressStage` now accepts a single number as the `time` argument,
  which determines the duration of the stage. The start time and end time
  are then inferred automatically with respect to the previous stage in the sequence.
  One can therefore write something like this:

````python
from psynet.timeline import ProgressDisplay, ProgressStage

ProgressDisplay(
    stages=[
        ProgressStage(0.75, "Wait a moment...", color="grey"),
        ProgressStage(1, "Red!", color="red"),
        ProgressStage(1, "Green!", color="green"),
        ProgressStage(1, "Blue!", color="blue"),
    ],
),
````

# [2.4.0] Released on 2021-07-21

- PsyNet now enforces at least one consent element to be included in a timeline. See `psynet/consent.py` for available consent modules. If you're sure you want to omit the consent form, include a ``NoConsent`` element.
- Minor improvement to video synchronization.

#### Updated
- Updated repp and tapping demos.
- Updated Dallinger to v7.5.0.

#### Fixed
- Fixed SQLAlchemy start-up error introduced in v2.2.1.

# [2.2.1] Released on 2021-06-21

#### Fixed
- Fixed bug to make pre-deployment routines work again

# [2.2.0] Released on 2021-06-16

#### Added
- Added new experiment variable ``hard_max_experiment_payment`` which allows for setting a hard, absolute limit on the amount spent in an experiment. Bonuses are not paid from the point the value is reached and the amount of unpaid bonus is saved in the participant's `unpaid_bonus` variable. Default is $1100.
- Allow for changing the soft and hard spending limits from the dashboard's timeline tab. Clicking on the upper, green progress bar shows/hides the corresponding UI widgets.

#### Changed
- Renamed the `media_url` property of `RecordTrial` to `recording_url` so as to not clash with the same method name in `StaticTrial`.

#### Fixed
- Fixed bug with wrong `minimal_interactions` functionality of `SliderControl` due to duplicate event handling in `control.html`.
- The renamed `recording_url` method incorrectly only returned camera urls. This was replaced with the correct `url` key.
- Fixed issue where `max_loop_time_condition` would be logged to the participant table
  every trial in a trial maker.

# [2.1.2] Released on 2021-06-15

#### Fixed
- Hotfix for bonus/time estimation bug: `time_estimate` for `EndPage`
  is now set to zero. This means that experiment estimated durations
  (and corresponding bonuses) will decrease slighly.

# [2.1.1] Released on 2021-06-10

#### Fixed
- Fixed incorrect version number.

# [2.1.0] Released on 2021-06-10

#### Added
- Added new support for trial-level answer scoring and performance bonuses,
  via the `Trial.score_answer` and `Trial.compute_bonus` methods.
- Added `fade_out` option to `AudioPrompt`.

#### Fixed
- Improved robustness of browser-based regression tests.
- Fixed incorrect performance bonus assignment for trial makers initialized with `check_performance_every_trial = True`.
- Various bugfixes in audio-visual playback/recording interfaces.
- Reverted the new language config.txt parameter, which was causing problems in various situations.
  This functionality will be reinstated in the upcoming Dallinger release.

# [2.0.0] Released on 2021-05-31

#### Added
- Added support for video imitation chains and camera/screen record trials.
- Added a new system for organizing the timing of front-end events.
The API for some `Prompt` and `Control` elements has changed somewhat as a result.
- Added `ProgressDisplay` functionality, which visualizes the  current progress in the trial with text messages and/or
progress bars.
- Added `controls`, `muted`, and `hide_when_finished` arguments to `VideoPrompt`.
- PsyNet now requires a `language` argument in config.txt.
- New function: `psynet.utils.get_language`, which returns the language
specified in config.txt.
- Added the ability to parallelize stimulus generation in `AudioGibbs` experiments.
- Added `current_module` to a participant's export data.
- Allow for arbitrary number of audio record channels in `VideoRecordControl`.
- Update Dallinger to v7.4.0.

#### Renamed
- Changed several methods from English to US spelling: `synthesise_target` (now `synthesize_target`),
`summarise_trial` (now `summarize_trial`), `analyse_trial` (now `analyze_trial`),
and all prompts and pre-screening tasks involving `colour` (now `color`).
- The output format for `TimedPushButtonControl` has now changed to use
camel case consistently, e.g. writing `buttonId` instead of `button_id`.
This reflects the camel case formatting conventions of the trial
scheduler and the JS front-end.
- Renamed `REPPMarkersCheck` -> `REPPMarkersTest`.
- Renamed `AttentionCheck` -> `AttentionTest`.
- Renamed `HeadphoneCheck` -> `HeadphoneTest`.
- Renamed `active_balancing_across_chains` -> `balance_across_chains`.
- Renamed `NonAdaptive` -> `Static`.

#### Fixed
- make `play_window` work in `VideoPrompt`.
- Add `try`/`except` blocks in case of an `SMTPAuthenticationError`/`Exception` when calling `admin_notifier()`.
- Make `switch` work when a `TrialMaker` is given as a branch.
- Add `max_wait_time` and `max_loop_time` to `wait_while` and `while_loop`,  resp., to prevent participants from waiting forever.

#### Changed
- PsyNet now forces `disable_when_duration_exceeded = False` in `config.txt`.
This is done to avoid a rare bug where recruitment would be shut down erroneously in long-running experiments.
- `psynet debug` now warns the user if the app title is too long.
- Allow varying numbers of arguments in function argument of `StartSwitch`.

#### BREAKING CHANGES
- Required `language` argument in config.txt.
- Required `disable_when_duration_exceeded = False` argument in config.txt
- Various renamings, see section 'Renamed' above.


# [1.14.0] Released on 2021-05-17

#### Added
- It is now possible to use `save_answer` to specify a participant variable
in which the answer should be saved:

```python
from psynet.modular_page import ModularPage, Prompt, NumberControl

ModularPage(
    "weight",
    Prompt("What is your weight in kg?"),
    NumberControl(),
    time_estimate=5,
    save_answer="weight",
)
```

The resulting answer can then be accessed, in this case, by `participant.var.weight`.

- Implement consent pages as `Module`s to be added to an experiment `Timeline` (CAPRecruiterStandardConsent, CAPRecruiterAudiovisualConsent, MTurkStandardConsent, MTurkAudiovisualConsent, PrincetonConsent).

#### Changed
- Migrate background tasks to Dallinger's new `scheduled_task` API.
This means that the tasks now run on the clock dyno,
and are now robust to dyno restarts, app crashes etc.
- Apply DRY principle to demo directories (delete redundant error.html and layout.html files).
- Change the way experiment variables are set. For details on this important change, see the documentation at https://computational-audition-lab.gitlab.io/psynet/low_level/Experiment.html
- PsyNet now uses the `experiment_routes` and `dashboard_tab` functionality
implemented in Dallinger v7.3.0.
