class Experiment(dallinger.experiment.Experiment, metaclass=ExperimentMeta):
    # pylint: disable=abstract-method
    """
    The main experiment class from which to inherit when building experiments.

    Several experiment options can be set through the experiment class.
    For example, the storage back-end can be selected by setting the ``asset_storage`` attribute:

    ::

        class Exp(psynet.experiment.Experiment):

    Another experiment attribute is `export_classes_to_skip`, which is a list of classes to be excluded
    when exporting the database objects to JSON-style dictionaries. The default is `["ExperimentStatus"]`.

    Config variables can be set here, amongst other places (see online documentation for details):

    ::

        class Exp(psynet.experiment.Experiment):
            config = {
                "min_accumulated_reward_for_abort": 0.15,
                "show_abort_button": True,
            }

    Custom CSS stylesheets can be included here, to style the appearance of the experiment:

    ::

        class Exp(psynet.experiment.Experiment):
            css_links = ["static/theme.css"]

    CSS can also be included directly as part of the experiment class via the ``css`` attribute,
    see ``custom_theme`` demo for details.

    There are a number of variables tied to an experiment all of which are documented below.
    They have been assigned reasonable default values which can be overridden when defining an experiment
    (see method ``_default_variables``). Also, they can be enriched with new variables in the following way:

    ::

        import psynet.experiment

        class Exp(psynet.experiment.Experiment):
            variables = {
                "new_variable": "some-value",  # Adding a new variable
            }

    These variables can then be changed in the course of experiment, just like (e.g.) participant variables.

    ::

        from psynet.timeline import CodeBlock

        CodeBlock(lambda experiment: experiment.var.set("custom-variable", 42))

    Default experiment variables accessible through `psynet.experiment.Experiment.var` are:

    max_participant_payment : `float`
        The maximum payment in US dollars a participant is allowed to get. Default: `25.0`.

    soft_max_experiment_payment : `float`
        The recruiting process stops if the amount of accumulated payments
        (incl. time and performance rewards) in US dollars exceedes this value. Default: `1000.0`.

    hard_max_experiment_payment : `float`
        Guarantees that in an experiment no more is spent than the value assigned.
        Bonuses are not paid from the point this value is reached and a record of the amount
        of unpaid bonus is kept in the participant's `unpaid_bonus` variable. Default: `1100.0`.

    big_base_payment : `bool`
        Set this to `True` if you REALLY want to set `base_payment` to a value > 20.

    There are also a few experiment variables that are set automatically and that should,
    in general, not be changed manually:

    psynet_version : `str`
        The version of the `psynet` package.

    dallinger_version : `str`
        The version of the `Dallinger` package.

    python_version : `str`
        The version of the `Python`.

    hard_max_experiment_payment_email_sent : `bool`
        Whether an email to the experimenter has already been sent indicating the `hard_max_experiment_payment`
        had been reached. Default: `False`. Once this is `True`, no more emails will be sent about
        this payment limit being reached.

    soft_max_experiment_payment_email_sent : `bool`
        Whether an email to the experimenter has already been sent indicating the `soft_max_experiment_payment`
        had been reached. Default: `False`. Once this is `True`, no more emails will be sent about
        this payment limit being reached.


    In addition to the config variables in Dallinger, PsyNet adds the following:

    min_browser_version : `str`
        The minimum version of the Chrome browser a participant needs in order to take a HIT. Default: `80.0`.

    wage_per_hour : `float`
        The payment in currency the participant gets per hour. Default: `9.0`.

    currency : `str`
        The currency in which the participant gets paid. Default: `$`.

    min_accumulated_reward_for_abort : `float`
        The threshold of reward accumulated in US dollars for the participant to be able to receive
        compensation when aborting an experiment using the `Abort experiment` button. Default: `0.20`.

    show_abort_button : `bool`
        If ``True``, the `Ad` page displays an `Abort` button the participant can click to terminate the HIT,
        e.g. in case of an error where the participant is unable to finish the experiment. Clicking the button
        assures the participant is compensated on the basis of the amount of reward that has been accumulated.
        Default ``False``.

    show_reward : `bool`
        If ``True`` (default), then the participant's current estimated reward is displayed
        at the bottom of the page.

    show_footer : `bool`
        If ``True`` (default), then a footer is displayed at the bottom of the page containing a 'Help' button
        and reward information if `show_reward` is set to `True`.

    show_progress_bar : `bool`
        If ``True`` (default), then a progress bar is displayed at the top of the page.

    check_participant_opened_devtools : ``bool``
        If ``True``, whenever a participant opens the developer tools in the web browser,
        this is logged as participant.var.opened_devtools = ``True``,
        and the participant is shown a warning alert message.
        Default: ``False``.
        Note: Chrome does not currently expose an official way of checking whether
        the participant opens the developer tools. People therefore have to rely
        on hacks to detect it. These hacks can often be broken by updates to Chrome.
        We've therefore disabled this check by default, to reduce the risk of
        false positives. Experimenters wishing to enable the check for an individual
        experiment are recommended to verify that the check works appropriately
        before relying on it. We'd be grateful for any contributions of updated
        developer tools checks.

    window_width : ``int``
        Determines the width in pixels of the window that opens when the
        participant starts the experiment. Only active if
        recruiter.start_experiment_in_popup_window is True.
        Default: ``1024``.

    window_height : ``int``
        Determines the width in pixels of the window that opens when the
        participant starts the experiment. Only active if
        recruiter.start_experiment_in_popup_window is True.
        Default: ``768``.

    supported_locales : ``list``
        List of locales (i.e., ISO language codes) a user can pick from, e.g., ``'["en"]'``.
        Default: ``'[]'``.

    force_google_chrome : ``bool``
        Forces the user to use the Google Chrome browser. If another browser is used, it will give detailed instructions
        on how to install Google Chrome.
        Default: ``True``.

    leave_comments_on_every_page : ``bool``
        Allows the user to leave comments on every page.
        Default: ``False``.

    force_incognito_mode : ``bool``
        Forces the user to open the experiment in a private browsing (i.e. incognito mode). This is helpful as incognito
        mode prevents the user from accessing their browsing history, which could be used to influence the experiment.
        Furthermore it does not enable addons which can interfere with the experiment. If the user is not using
        incognito mode, it will give detailed instructions on how to open the experiment in incognito mode.
        Default: ``False``.

    allow_mobile_devices : ``bool``
        Allows the user to use mobile devices. If it is set to false it will tell the user to open the experiment on
        their computer.
        Default: ``False``.


    needs_internet_access: ``bool``
        Indicates whether the experiment needs internet access. Can be set to ``False`` for lab or field studies.
        Default: ``True``.

        Parameters
        ----------

        context: str
             Will receive a string that describes the context in which the function has been called.
             Possibles include:
             - "dashboard": The function is producing data to be displayed in the dashboard
             - "export": The function is being called within psynet export
             - "backup": The function is being called within PsyNet autobackups

            Dictionary of arbitrary URL GET parameters that can optionally be used by the get_basic_data implementation to
            further customiser what data is provided.

        Returns
        -------
        dict
            A dictionary of data to be returned to the client. The keys of the dictionary should be strings, and the
            values can be any JSON-serializable object.

        Raises
        ------
        DataError
            A custom exception that can be raised if the data cannot be retrieved for some reason.

        This method is currently only called if the 'generic' recruiter is selected.
        We may propagate it to other recruiter methods eventually too.
        If left unchanged, the default recruiter exit message from Dallinger will be shown.
        Otherwise, one can return a custom message in various ways.
        If you return a string, this will be escaped appropriately and presented as text.
        Alternatively, more complex HTML structures can be constructed using the
        Python package ``dominate``, see Examples for details.

        Examples

def pre_deploy_constant(key, func: callable):
    """
    Registers a pre-deploy constant.
    A pre-deploy constant is a value that is computed before the experiment is deployed,
    and then stored in a file in the .deploy directory.
    When the value is accessed during the deployed experiment,
    the value is retrieved from the file rather than being computed again.
    A common application is experiments whose design is determined by the contents of a directory,
    such as experiments that use audio stimuli,
    which are not uploaded directly to the experiment server and hence cannot be accessed
    by file listing commands.

    Parameters
    ----------
    key : str
        The key of the pre-deploy constant. If it's not a string, it will be converted to one
        using ``psynet.serialize.serialize``.
    func : callable
        A callable that computes and returns the value of the pre-deploy constant.

    Returns
    -------
    The value of the pre-deploy constant.

    Examples
    --------

    # You could place this in your experiment.py file to list the files in the ``data`` directory.
