"""Graph algorithms package.

This package provides mixins for various graph algorithms:
- CentralityMixin: PageRank, degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector centrality
- CommunityMixin: Label propagation, Louvain, Leiden community detection
- ComponentsMixin: Weakly/strongly connected components
- PathsMixin: Shortest path, A*, APSP
- TraversalMixin: BFS, DFS
- SimilarityMixin: Node similarity, KNN, triangle count
- ExportMixin: Export to rustworkx
