# Notion Configuration Example
# Copy this file to .env.notion and fill in your actual values
# NEVER commit .env.notion to git (it's in .gitignore)

# Required: Notion integration token
# Get from: https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
# Format: ntn_followed by long alphanumeric string
NOTION_TOKEN=ntn_your_integration_token_here

# Optional but recommended: Default parent page ID for uploads
# This is where new pages will be created as children
# Get from your Notion page URL (the long ID at the end)
# Example: https://notion.so/My-Page-abc123def456 → use abc123def456
NOTION_PARENT_PAGE=your_default_parent_page_id_here

# Notes:
# 1. No quotes needed around values
# 2. No spaces around the = sign
# 3. Make sure to share your parent page with the integration in Notion
# 4. To share: Open page → "..." menu → "Add connections" → Select your integration
