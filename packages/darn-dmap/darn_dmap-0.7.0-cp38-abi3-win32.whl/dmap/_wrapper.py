    Reads in DMAP data from `source`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source: Union[str, bytes]
        Where to read data from. If input is of type `str`, this is interpreted as the path to a file.
        If input is of type `bytes`, this is interpreted as the raw data itself.
    fmt: str
        DMAP format being read. One of `["dmap", "iqdat", "rawacf", "fitacf", "grid", "map", "snd"]`.
    mode: str
        Mode in which to read the data, one of `["strict", "lax", "sniff", "metadata"]`. In `strict` mode, any corruption
        in the data will raise an error. In `lax` mode, all valid records will be returned in a tuple along with
        the byte index of `source` where the corruption starts. In `sniff` mode, `source` must be a `str`, and
        only the first record will be read. In `metadata` mode, only the metadata fields of the records are returned.

    Returns
    -------
    If `mode` is `strict` or `metadata`, returns `list[dict]` which is the parsed records.
    If `mode` is `lax`, returns `tuple[list[dict], Optional[int]]`, where the first element is the records which were parsed,
    and the second is the byte index where `source` was no longer a valid record of type `fmt`.
    If `mode` is `sniff`, returns `dict` of the first record.
