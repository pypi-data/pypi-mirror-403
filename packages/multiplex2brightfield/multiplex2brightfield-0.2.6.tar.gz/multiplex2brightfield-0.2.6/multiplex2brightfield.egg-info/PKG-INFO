# multiplex2brightfield

`multiplex2brightfield` is a Python package designed to convert multiplex imaging data (such as Imaging Mass Cytometry - IMC, CODEX, etc.) into virtual brightfield images, simulating traditional histological stains like Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E), Immunohistochemistry (IHC), Masson's Trichrome, PAS, and others. The library utilizes the OME-TIFF file format for both input and output, ensuring compatibility with standard bioimaging workflows and preservation of metadata.

## Features

* **Multiplex to Virtual Brightfield Conversion**: Transform multiplex image data into various simulated brightfield stains.
* **Multiple Stain Simulations**: Supports built-in configurations for H&E, IHC, Masson Trichrome, PAS, Jones Silver, Toluidine Blue, and configurations matching specific scanner outputs (e.g., Aperio CS2, Hamamatsu XR).
* **OME-TIFF Input/Output**: Reads and writes OME-TIFF files, preserving essential metadata like pixel sizes and channel names.
* **Pyramid Generation**: Optionally creates multi-resolution OME-TIFF pyramids for efficient viewing of large images.
* **Flexible Channel Mapping**:
    * Uses predefined marker lists for common stains.
    * Leverages Large Language Models (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) to automatically map markers to stain components based on channel names and stain type.
* **Image Processing**: Offers options for image enhancement and artifact reduction, including:
    * Median filtering.
    * Gaussian smoothing.
    * Image sharpening.
    * Intensity adjustments.
    * Per-channel histogram normalization or clipping.
    * Reference-based histogram matching.
* **AI Enhancement**: Includes an optional AI model to enhance the visual quality of the generated brightfield image.
* **Large Image Handling**: Supports tiled processing and memory mapping (`memmap`) for converting very large images that may not fit into RAM.
* **Resampling**: Allows adjusting the output pixel size.

## Installation

Install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install multiplex2brightfield
```

## Usage

### Basic Conversion (Virtual H&E)

```python
from multiplex2brightfield import convert_from_file

# Input and output file paths
input_filename = "path/to/your/input_image.ome.tiff"
output_filename = "path/to/your/output_virtual_HE.ome.tiff"

# This assumes your input OME-TIFF has channel names identifiable
# by the default H&E configuration in configuration_presets.py
convert_from_file(
    input_filename=input_filename,
    output_filename=output_filename,
    stain="H&E", # Specify the desired stain preset
    create_pyramid=True # Generate OME-TIFF pyramid
)

print(f"Virtual H&E image saved to {output_filename}")
```

## Configuration File Format

The virtual staining conversion uses a configuration dictionary that defines how each stain component is simulated. The configuration is based on the following template:

```python
template = {
    "name": "<stain_name>",  # e.g., "H&E"
    "components": {
        "<component_name>": {  # e.g., "haematoxylin"
            "color": {
                "R": 0,  # Integer between 0-255, representing the red channel value.
                "G": 0,  # Integer between 0-255, representing the green channel value.
                "B": 0,  # Integer between 0-255, representing the blue channel value.
            },
            "description": "string",  # A brief description of the component's role.
            "targets": [],  # A list of marker or channel names to assign to this component (e.g., markers for nuclei, cytoplasm, etc.).
            "intensity": 1.0,  # A scaling factor for the expression intensity of this component.
            "median_filter_size": 0,  # Size of the median filter kernel to reduce noise (0 means no filtering).
            "gaussian_filter_sigma": 0,  # The standard deviation for Gaussian smoothing (0 means no smoothing).
            "sharpen_filter_amount": 0,  # Amount of sharpening to apply (0 means no sharpening).
            "histogram_normalisation": False,  # Whether to apply histogram normalization to the component.
            "normalize_percentage_min": 10,  # Lower percentile bound for intensity normalization.
            "normalize_percentage_max": 90,  # Upper percentile bound for intensity normalization.
            "clip": None,  # Optional value to clip intensity values to a specific range.
        },
        # Additional components can be added here (e.g., "eosinophilic", "epithelial", "erythrocytes").
    },
    "background": {
        "color": {
            "R": 255,  # Red channel value for the background.
            "G": 255,  # Green channel value for the background.
            "B": 255,  # Blue channel value for the background.
        }
    },
}
```

### Explanation of the Configuration Fields

- `name` (str): A string that identifies the stain configuration (e.g., "H&E"). This determines the overall naming and may be used to select preset configurations.
- `components` (dictionary): A dictionary where each key is the name of a stain component (e.g., "haematoxylin", "eosinophilic", etc.). Each component defines:
    - `component_name` (str): The name of the component.
        - `color` (dictionary): A dictionary with keys `"R"`, `"G"`, and `"B"` specifying the color to be used for that component in the output image. Values should be in the range 0–255.
        - `description` (str): A textual explanation of what the component represents (e.g., nuclear staining, cytoplasmic staining).
        - `targets` (list of str): An array of strings listing marker or channel names that the component should represent. The conversion function will map the channels from your multiplex image to these targets.
        - `intensity` (float): A scaling factor (typically 1.0 by default) that controls how strongly the component is rendered.
        - `median_filter_size` (int): Defines the size of the median filter (if >0) for reducing noise.
        - `gaussian_filter_sigma` (float): Specifies the sigma for Gaussian filtering, used to smooth the image.
        - `sharpen_filter_radius` (int): Defines the size of the sharpen filter (if >0).
        - `sharpen_filter_amount` (float): Determines how much to sharpen the image.
        - `histogram_normalisation` (bool): A Boolean flag that, when set to True, applies histogram normalization to enhance image contrast.
        - `normalize_percentage_min` and `normalize_percentage_max` (float): Define the lower and upper percentile values used during normalization to adjust the dynamic range.
        - `clip` (tuple of float, float or None): An optional parameter to clip intensity values within a specified range; if not needed, it remains `None`.
- `background`:
    - `color` (dictionary): A dictionary with keys `"R"`, `"G"`, and `"B"` defining the background color (typically white: 255, 255, 255).

This configuration template provides a flexible way to customize how different image components are processed and visualized, making it easy to simulate various staining protocols by simply adjusting these parameters.

### Examples of the Configuration Values


Below are visual examples of how individual configuration parameters affect the rendered brightfield output.
All examples show the same cropped region of the image for direct comparison.

#### Baseline

This is the baseline configuration where all processing parameters are disabled
(i.e. set to `0`, full-range, or `False`). The only exception is
`normalize_percentage_max`, which is set to `99`. If `normalize_percentage_max` is set to `100`, extreme high-intensity hotspots
dominate the scaling and cause most structural detail to disappear.

---

#### `intensity`

Controls the overall strength of the stain component.
Higher values make the component color stronger, while lower values make it lighter.

![Intensity](images/examples_intensity.jpg)

---

#### `median_filter_size`

Applies median filtering, typically useful for removing salt-and-pepper noise.  
Higher values increase smoothing while preserving edges better than Gaussian blur in some cases.

![Median filter](images/examples_median_filter_size.jpg)

---

#### `gaussian_filter_sigma`

Applies Gaussian smoothing to reduce high-frequency noise.  
Higher values produce a more blurred, smoother appearance.

![Gaussian smoothing](images/examples_gaussian_filter.jpg)

---

#### `sharpen_filter_radius` and `sharpen_filter_amount`

Sharpens edges and local contrast.
- `sharpen_filter_radius` controls the spatial scale of sharpening.
- `sharpen_filter_amount` controls how strong the sharpening effect is.

![Sharpening](images/examples_sharpen_filter.jpg)

---

#### `histogram_normalisation`

If enabled, normalizes intensities to increase contrast and spread values across a usable range.  
This can make faint structures more visible but may also amplify noise.

![Histogram normalisation](images/examples_histogram_normalisation.jpg)

---

#### `normalize_percentage_min` and `normalize_percentage_max`

Defines the percentile range used for intensity normalization.
- Increasing `normalize_percentage_min` suppresses dim signal.
- Decreasing `normalize_percentage_max` can prevent high value pixles, such as hotspots, from dominating.

![Percentile normalisation](images/examples_normalize_percentage.jpg)

---

#### `clip`

Clips the intensity range to a fixed interval `[min, max]`.

This can be used to:
- suppress very low intensity background signal
- prevent extremely bright pixels from saturating the final output
