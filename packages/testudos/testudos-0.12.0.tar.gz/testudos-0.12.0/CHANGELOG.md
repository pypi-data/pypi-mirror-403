# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.12.0] - 2026-01-23

### Added
- `--color` / `--no-color` CLI flags to control colored output (resolves #20)
  - `--color`: Force colored output even when not connected to a TTY
  - `--no-color`: Disable colored output (useful for CI, piping, or accessibility)
  - Default behavior (no flag): Auto-detect based on terminal capabilities
  - Note: Rich also respects `NO_COLOR` and `FORCE_COLOR` environment variables

## [0.11.1] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- Fixed dependency installation for subject projects when using `uv run --isolated`
  - Previously, when the test command (e.g., pytest) was not a direct dependency of the
    subject project, uv would use a globally installed tool that ran in a separate
    environment without access to the project's dependencies
  - Now uses `--with <test_command>` flag to ensure the test command runs in the same
    isolated environment as the project, with full access to all dependencies
  - Also adds `--with coverage` when coverage mode is enabled

### Added
- Comprehensive test suite for dependency installation verification
  (`tests/test_dependency_installation.py`)

## [0.11.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- Test timeout configuration to fail tests that exceed a specified duration (resolves #23)
- `--timeout` / `-t` CLI option to set timeout in seconds per Python version
- `--no-timeout` CLI flag to disable timeout (overrides config file setting)
- `timeout` configuration option in `[tool.testudos]` section of pyproject.toml
- Clear timeout error messages indicating which version timed out

## [0.10.0] - 2025-12-27

### Changed
 - Renamed project to testudos

## [0.9.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- Strict mypy configuration with comprehensive type checking (resolves #27)
- Version bump validation script (`scripts/check_version_bump.py`)
- CI job to enforce version bump and changelog updates on PRs
- `just check-version` recipe for local validation

### Changed
- Migrated parallel execution to use only asyncio, removing ThreadPoolExecutor (resolves #19)
- `run_tests_parallel` replaced by `run_tests_parallel_async` in public API
- `runner.run()` now uses `asyncio.run()` internally for parallel execution

### Removed
- `run_tests_parallel` function (use `run_tests_parallel_async` instead)
- `concurrent.futures` dependency for parallel execution

### Fixed
- Type errors across codebase to satisfy strict mypy checks
