                    This method performs candidate search once and reuses it when matching
                    sub-trajectories. When the matching algorithm
                    encounters failures (no candidates, disconnected layers), it automatically

                           Higher values improve matching quality in dense networks but slow
                           performance. Typical: 4-16. Default: 8.

                           around each GPS point (in coordinate units). Should exceed typical GPS
                           errors. Typical: 30-100 meters. Default: 50.
        
                        gps_error: Expected GPS accuracy (standard deviation in coordinate units).
                           Used in emission probability: P(obs|candidate) ~ exp(-dist²/(2*gps_error²)).
                           Higher values are more tolerant of GPS noise. Typical: 10-100 meters.
                           Default: 50.
        
                        reverse_tolerance: Maximum distance allowed when routing backward along
                           an edge (in coordinate units). Set to 0 to forbid reversing, which is
                           recommended for directed road networks. Default: 0.0.
        
                        transition_mode: Routing cost metric - SHORTEST (distance) or FASTEST (time).
                           Must match the mode used to create NetworkGraph and UBODT. Default: SHORTEST.

                           points (distance units per time unit). REQUIRED for FASTEST mode, unused
                           for SHORTEST mode. This represents the typical speed at which vehicles
                           travel directly between points. Lower values encourage sticking to routes,
                           higher values allow more detours. Typical: average vehicle speed like 40-60
                           in urban areas. Default: None.

                    Example:
                        Trajectory with points [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] where point 4 has no candidates:
                        - Returns 2 sub-trajectories: [0-3] SUCCESS, [4-4] CANDIDATES_NOT_FOUND
                        - If points 5-7 can be matched, adds [5-7] SUCCESS
                        - Much faster than calling match_trajectory() multiple times since
                          candidate lookup is done once
        
                    Note:
                        The config's transition_mode must match the mode used to create the

            A GPS trajectory consisting of sequential observations.
    
            Trajectories can include timestamps (x, y, t) for time interpolation or be
            spatial-only (x, y). The trajectory's geometry and timestamps are used during
            map matching to find the best road path.
