# FLUX Definition (Theus V3)
# Instead of Python FSM states, we manage control flow declaratively.

steps:
  - process: p_init
    
  # Example Loop
  - flux: while
    condition: "domain.processed_count < 50"
    do:
       - process: p_process
         
       # Example Conditional
       - flux: if
         condition: "domain.processed_count % 20 == 0"
         then:
           - process: save_checkpoint_placeholder
    
  - process: p_finalize
