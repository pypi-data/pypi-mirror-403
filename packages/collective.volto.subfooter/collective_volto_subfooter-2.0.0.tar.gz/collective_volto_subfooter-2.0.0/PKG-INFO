--------

- Control panel for plone registry to manage subfooter configuration.

Volto endpoint
--------------

Anonymous users can't access registry resources by default with plone.restapi (there is a special permission).

You can edit settings directly from Volto because the control has been registered on Plone and available with plone.restapi.
