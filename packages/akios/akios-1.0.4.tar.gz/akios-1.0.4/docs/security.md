## 🛡️ Security Features In v1.0

### Container Isolation (All Platforms)
- **Policy-based sandbox**: Command allowlisting and path restrictions
- **Resource quotas**: CPU, memory, and disk limits via cgroups v2
- **Process isolation**: Container-based separation from host system
- **Network controls**: Controlled external access

### AI-Specific Protections
- **Comprehensive PII redaction**: 50+ pattern detection covering personal, financial, health, and location data
- **Cost kill-switches**: Automatic termination on budget violations with consistent testing support
- **Input validation**: Automatic size limits (100k characters) and safety checks on all AI inputs
- **Rate limiting protection**: Exponential backoff retry for API reliability
- **Loop prevention**: Detection and blocking of infinite loops
- **Content validation**: Output verification and anomaly detection
- **Output sanitization**: Post-processing redaction of AI-generated content

### Audit & Compliance
- **Comprehensive logging**: All operations tracked with timestamps
- **Merkle audit ledger**: Tamper-evident cryptographic audit trails with proof verification
- **PII-safe logs**: Sensitive data automatically redacted in real-time
- **Export capabilities**: Audit reports for GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance

### Platform-Specific Security

#### Native Linux
- **Full security features**: Real cgroups v2 resource control + seccomp-bpf syscall filtering
- **Kernel-hardened isolation**: Direct kernel integration with BPF bytecode enforcement
- **Optimal performance**: Native kernel security with minimal overhead

#### Docker (Cross-Platform)
- **Container security**: Policy-based isolation across macOS, Linux, Windows
- **Host protection**: Container prevents direct host system access
- **Adaptive security**: Automatic adjustment for containerized environments

**Security approach**: Defense in depth with kernel-level enforcement, comprehensive PII protection, and cryptographic audit trails.

## 🔍 Verifying Security Settings

### Security Dashboard
View comprehensive security status and active protections:

```bash
# Show detailed security dashboard
akios status --security

# Show security information in JSON format
akios status --security --json
```

### Security Status in Regular Output
Security summary is included in standard status output:

```bash
akios status
# Shows: Security Level, PII Protection, Network Access, Audit Logging
```

### What the Dashboard Shows
- **Security Level**: Full (kernel-hard) vs Strong (policy-based)
- **PII Protection**: Input and output redaction status
- **Network Access**: Allowed/blocked external connections
- **Audit Logging**: Cryptographic trail status
- **Cost Controls**: Budget and token limits
- **Compliance Indicators**: Audit integrity and process isolation
