## [Unreleased]

Future open-source releases (V1.x / V2.0) will focus on gradual usability improvements while preserving the security & governance-first cage.

Planned directions (non-binding, community-driven):
- Parallel, conditional, loop, and fan-out execution patterns
- Additional core agents (DB connectors, Email, Slack…)
- Full CLI suite and basic REST API
- Enhanced state persistence and crash recovery
- More high-quality example templates
- Basic observability (Prometheus/Jaeger integration)

**Legal/certified features** (FranceConnect, eIDAS, hard HDS blocks, official PDFs) remain exclusive to AKIOS PRO.
