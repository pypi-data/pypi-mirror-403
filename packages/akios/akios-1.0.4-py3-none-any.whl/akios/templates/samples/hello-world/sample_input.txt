Greetings from the AKIOS sample data repository!

This is a sample text file to demonstrate the hello-workflow template.
When you run the hello-workflow.yml template, it will:

1. Read this file using the filesystem agent
2. Send the content to your LLM provider (OpenAI/Anthropic/Grok/Mistral/Gemini)
3. Generate a creative AI response
4. Save the AI-generated content to a new file

This demonstrates the complete AKIOS workflow:
- Secure file access with path restrictions
- AI API integration with cost controls
- Result storage with audit logging

Try it out with: akios run templates/hello-workflow.yml
