The aim of the biomacromolecules (bio) module is the calculation of static and dynamic scattering properties
of biological molecules as proteins or DNA (and later the analysis of MD simulations).

- Functions are provided to calculate **SAXS/SANS** formfactors, effective diffusion
  or intermediate scattering functions as measured by SAXS/SANS, Neutron Spinecho Spectroscopy (**NSE**),
  BackScattering (**BS**) or TimeOfFlight (**TOF**) methods.

- For the handling of atomic structures as PDB files (https://www.rcsb.org/) we use the library
  `MDAnalysis <https://www.mdanalysis.org/>`_ which allows **reading/writing of PDB files** and
  molecular dynamics trajectory files of various formats and MD simulation tools.

- PDB structures contain in most cases no hydrogen atoms.
  There are several possibilities to **add hydrogens** to existing PDB structures
  (see Notes in :py:func:`~jscatter.bio.mda.pdb2pqr`).
  We use the algorithm  pdb2pqr (allows debumping and optimization) or a simpler algorithm from PyMol.

- **Mode analysis** allows deformations of structures or calculation of dynamic properties.
  Deformation modes can be used to fit a protein structure to SAXS/SANS data (also simultaneous).

- To inspect the content of a universe or changes in a structure Pymol, VMD or other visualization viewers can be used.
  In a Jupyter notebook nglview can be used.
