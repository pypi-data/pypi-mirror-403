"""
Physical equations and useful formulas as quadrature of vector functions, parallel execution,
viscosity, compressibility of water, scatteringLengthDensityCalc or sedimentationProfile.
Use scipy.constants for physical constants.

- Each topic is not enough for a single module, so this is a collection.
- All scipy functions can be used. See http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/special.html.
- Statistical functions http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html.

Mass and scattering length of all elements in Elements are taken from :
 - Mass: http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/AtWt/
 - Neutron scattering length: http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/n-lengths/list.html

Units converted to amu for mass and nm for scattering length.
