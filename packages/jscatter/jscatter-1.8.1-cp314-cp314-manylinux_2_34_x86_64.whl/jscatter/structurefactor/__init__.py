"""
Fluid like and crystal like structure factors (sf) and directly related functions for scattering
related to interaction potentials between particles.

Fluid like include hard core SF or charged sphere sf and more.
For RMSA an improved algorithm is used based on the original idea (see Notes in RMSA).

For lattices of ordered mesoscopic materials (see :ref:`Lattice`) the analytic sf can be calculated in
powder average or as oriented lattice with domain rotation.

Additionally, the structure factor of atomic lattices can be calculated using atomic scattering length.
Using coordinates from CIF (Crystallographic Information Format) file allow calculation of atomic crystal lattices.
