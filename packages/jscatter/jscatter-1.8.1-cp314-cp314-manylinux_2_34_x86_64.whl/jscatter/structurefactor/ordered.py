    r"""
    Radial structure factor S(q) in powder average of a crystal lattice with particle asymmetry,
    Debye-Waller factor, diffusive scattering and broadening due to domain size.

    - To get the full scattering the formfactor needs to be included (See Notes and Examples).
    - 1-3 dimensional lattice structures with basis containing multiple atoms (see lattice).
    - For 1D and 2D a corresponding 1D or 2D formfactor has to be used. See Notes.
    - Self absorption and self extinction are not included. Polarisation and Lorentz correction are optional.
    - **How to fit see last example** `latticeStructureFactor as a fit model`_ .

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : array float
        Norm of wavevectors in inverse units of lattice constant, units 1/nm
    domainsize : float
        Domainsize of the crystal, units as lattice constant of lattice.
        According to Debye-Scherrer equation :math:`fwhm=2\pi/domainsize` the peak width is determined [2]_.
    lattice : lattice object
        The crystal structure as defined in a lattice object. The size of the lattice is ignored. One of
        rhombicLattice, bravaisLattice, scLattice, bccLattice, fccLattice, diamondLattice, hexLattice, hcpLattice.
        See respective definitions.
        rhombicLattice can be used to define **arbitrary shaped particles** in the unit cell. See examples.
    lg : float, default = 1
        Lorenzian/Gaussian fraction describes the contributions of Gaussian and Lorenzian
        shape in peak shape (Voigt function).
         - lorenzian/gaussian >> 1  lorenzian,
         - lorenzian/gaussian ~  1  central part gaussian, outside lorenzian wings
         - lorenzian/gaussian << 1  gaussian
    asym : float, default=0
        Asymmetry factor in sigmoidal as :math:`2fwhm/(1+e^{asym*(x-center)})`
        For asym=0 the Voigt is symmetric with fwhm. See formel.voigt .
    rmsd : float, [3xfloat], default=0.02
        Root mean square displacement :math:`rmsd=<u^2>^{0.5}` determining the Debye Waller factor.
        Units as domainsize and lattice units.
         - float : The Debye Waller factor is used as :math:`DW(Q)=e^{-Q^2 rmsd^2 }=e^{-Q^2 u^2 }`
         - 3xfloat : Assuming different displacements along the lattice vectors.
           In general a matrix describes anisotropic displacements according to Kronenburg [6]_.
           We allow here anisotropic displacements :math:`rmsd = (u_1,u_2,u_3)` along the .latticeVectors
           :math:`v_i` with :math:`DW_{hkl}(Q)=exp(-q_{hkl} U q_{hkl})`
           and :math:`U=diag(u1,u2,u3)`. See Notes.
    beta : float, None, dataArray
        Asymmetry factor of the formfactor or reduction due to polydispersity.
         - None beta=1, No beta assumed (spherical symmetric formfactor, no polydispersity)
         - dataArray explicitly given as dataArray with beta in .Y column.
           Missing values are interpolated.
         - An approximation for polydisperse beta can be found in [1]_ equ.17.
           This can be realized by  beta=js.dA(np.vstack(q,np.exp(-(q*sr*R)**2)))
           with sr as relative standard deviation of gaussian distribution of the size R.
         - See .formfactor for different formfactors which explicit calculation of beta.
    hklmax : int
        Maximum order of the Bragg peaks to include.
    c : float, default=1
        Porod constant. See 3.8 in [1]_.
    wavelength : float, default =  None
        Wavelength of the measurement in units nm. If None .Braggtheta is not calculated.
        For Xray Cu K_a it is 0.15406 nm.
    corrections : list, default=[]
        List of corrections to apply, which depend on the measurement type/geometry [5]_.
        :math:`\theta` is here the scattering angle (not :math:`2\theta` as in diffraction is used)
         - *'TP'* Thompson polarisation correction :math:`(1+cos^2(\theta)/2)` for electromagnetic
           scattering as Xrays [4]_. For small angle scattering this is negligible but valid.
           For polarised beams the polarisation has to be included.
         - *'lh'* likelihood of a crystallite being in diffraction position :math:`cos(\theta/2)`.
         - *'LC'* Lorentz correction :math:`\sin(\theta)^{-1}` due to integration
            over the width of reciprocal Bragg peaks due to lattice imperfections and the width of the incoming
            beam. Use for Debye-Scherrer (powder of crystallites) diffraction.
         - *'area'* the intensity for a given diffraction peak is recorded on a narrow strip of
            photographic film instead of over the entire diffraction cone :math:`\sin(\theta)^{-1}`.
         - *'all'* common Lorentz and polarisation correction powder measurements of crystalline material.
            Use all from above. NOT for flat transmission geometry (typical SAS) or non crystallite .
           Corresponds to :math:`(1+cos^2(\theta)/2)/sin^2(\theta/2)/sin(\theta/2)`.
        The correction for the pixel area presented to scattering solid angle is included in sasImage in
        2D also correcting for offset detector positions of a flat detector,
        which cannot use the scattering angle :math:`\theta` as the geometry changes.

    Notes
    -----
    Analytical expressions for the scattering functions of **atomic crystals and ordered mesoscopic materials** .
    Ordered  structures  in 3D (fcc,  bcc,  hcp,  sc), 2D (hex, sq) and lamellar structures are considered.
    The expressions take into account particle size distributions and lattice point deviations, domain size,
    core/shell structures, as well as peak shapes varying analytically between Lorentzian and Gaussian functions.
    The expressions allow one to quantitatively describe high-resolution synchrotron small-angle X-ray (SAXS) and
    neutron scattering (SANS) curves from lipid and block copolymer lyotropic phases, core/shell nanoparticle
    superstructures, ordered nanocomposites, ordered mesoporous  materials and atomic crystal structures
    (see AgBe example).

    - The scattering intensity of a crystal domain in powder average is for isotropic scattering particles

      .. math:: I(q) = {\Delta\rho}^2 n P(q) S(q)

      with
       - :math:`\Delta\rho` scattering length difference between matrix and particles
       - :math:`n` number density (of elementary cells)
       - :math:`P(q)` radial averaged form factor of the particles
       - :math:`S(q)` structure factor :math:`S(q)`

      Separation of structure factor and formfactor :math:`P(q)` in 3D is possible under the assumption of
      isotropic oriented particles. Including polydispersity of particles as size polydispersity or
      anisotropic shape like ellipsoids (but still isotropic orientation) leads to the correction :math:`\beta(q)`.
      :math:`\beta(q)` does not account for non isotropic alignment as e.g.in lyotropic phases of cylinders.

      For 1D and 2D structure factor a corresponding formfactor with reduced dimesionlity
      that factorizes has to be used.
      Explicitly e.g. using a 3D formfactor as a sphere in 2D hexagonal lattice is wrong.
      Approximately a very long oriented cylinder might be used, but a flat disc (2D) is correct.

    - The above structure factor is [1]_ :

      .. math:: S(q)=1+ \beta(q)(Z_0(q)-1)*DW(q)

      with
       - :math:`\beta(q)=<F(q)>^2/<F(q)^2>` as asymmetry factor [3]_ dependent on the
         scattering amplitude :math:`F(q)` and particle polydispersity
       -  :math:`DW(q)` Debye Waller factor

    - The lattice factor is [1]_ :

      .. math :: Z_0(q) = \frac{(2\pi)^{d-1}c}{nv_dq^{d-1}} \sum\limits_{hkl}m_{hkl}f_{hkl}^2L_{hkl}(q)

      with
       - :math:`n`           number of particles per unit cell
       - :math:`f_{hkl}`     unit cell structure factor that takes into account symmetry-related extinction rules
       - :math:`v_d`         volume of the d-dimensional unit cell
       - :math:`hkl`         reflections
       - :math:`m_{hkl}`     peak multiplicity
       - :math:`c`           Porod constant :math:`\simeq 1`

    - The structure factors of lattices of anisotropic particles with strong orientation like ordered
      cylinders can be calculated using only the lattice factor and using a unit cell with additional
      dummy atoms representing the asymmetric particle.
      The unit cell structure factor represents in these cases the formfactor amplitude in direction of Bragg peaks.
      See later example **Lyotropic hexagonal phase**.

    - Unit cell structure factors :math:`f_{hkl}` are normalised that the lattice factor is normalised for
      infinite q to 1. With i as unit cell atoms at fractional position in the unit cell :math:`[x_i,y_i,z_i]`
      and scattering amplitude :math:`b_i` we get :

      .. math:: f_{hkl}^2 = \big(\sum_i b_i e^{-2\pi (hx_i+ky_i+lz_i)}\big)^2 / \sum_i b_i^2

    - We use a Voigt function for the peak shape :math:`L_{hkl}(q)` (see formel.voigt).
    - DW (isotropic) is a Debye Waller like factor as :math:`DW(q)=e^{-q^2<u^2>}` leading to a reduction
      of scattered intensity and diffusive scattering.
      It has contributions from thermal lattice disorder ( DW factor with 1/3 factor in 3D),
      surface roughness and size polydispersity.
    - DW anisotropic: in case of anisotropic Debye Waller factor according to Kronenburg [6]_ (beta==1):

      .. math::   S(q)= \frac{(2\pi)^{d-1}c}{nv_dq^{d-1}} \sum\limits_{hkl}
                         DW_{hkl}(q) m_{hkl}f_{hkl}^2L_{hkl}(q) +
                         (1-\sum\limits_{hkl}DW_{hkl}(q)/N)

      with :math:`DW_{hkl}(q) = exp(-q_{hkl}Uq_{hkl})`, N as number of hkl. :math:`q_{hkl}` is the
      scattering vector in hkl direction and :math:`U` the diagonal matrix of squared displacements in direction of the
      basis lattice vectors.

      :math:`\beta(q)` is not included in this case as no particle orientational average is required.

    - For the limiting behaviour q->0 see the discussion in [1]_ in 3.9. :
       "... The zero-order peak is not explicitly considered because of the q^(1-dim) singularity and
       because its intensity depends also on the scattering length difference between the lattice inside and outside...
       Due to the singularity and since structural features on length scales d > a,
       such as packing defects, grain boundaries or fluctuations decaying on larger length scales
       are only indirectly considered via the domain size D, eq 30 is not expected to give good agreement with
       experimentally determined scattering curves in the range of scattering vectors q < 2π/a.
       However, for q > 2π/a, this approach describes remarkably well experimentally measured
       high-resolution scattering curves...."

      A good description of the real scattering for low Q is shown in
      example :ref:`A nano cube build of different lattices` for the example of a cube crystal domain..

    A realistic example of a **calibration measurement with AgBe**.
    We load the cif file of the crystal structure to build the lattice and find excellent agreement.
    According to materialsproject.org calculated XRD tends to underestimate lattice parameters.

    For AgBe the first peak is found at 1.07 and lamellar peaks go up to 12.9 because of the Ag atoms in lamellar stack.
    The broad strong peak 13.7-14 (and upwards) is caused by multiple not lamellar peaks from structure of Be atoms.

    **Anisotropic Debye Waller factor**

    We look at a hexagonal lyotropic phase of long cylinders (e.g. micelles) and calculate the structure factor.

    The formfactor amplitude influence is missing here.
    This cannot be included by multiplying with the orientational averaged fomfactor as the cylinders
    keep relative orientation. To include the formfactor amplitude look at the next example

    The dislocation along the cylinder axis direction might be larger than within the hexagonal plane.
    We might have dislocations and length polydispersity leading to different rmsd in crystal orientations.

    **Lyotropic hexagonal phase in 3D**
    Opposite to the above we include here the cylinder shape in the hexagonal lyotropic unit cell.
    We add in the unit cell a dummy atom representation of the cylinder with good enough resolution.
    This is used to calculate the  :math:`f_{hkl}^2` which represents the formfactor amplitude in hkl direction.

    This type of scattering is often described as 2D hexagonal lattice with 2D disc formfactor assuming an infinite long
    cylinder. Here we could add ellipsoids or other anisotropic shapes and inhomogeneous particles.

    We explicitly observe here suppression of higher order hexagonal peaks.
    The first hexagonal peak at :math:`2.46 nm^{-1}` show a shift due to the strong decrease on the ff amplitude.
    The general increase is due to diffuse scattering.

    **latticeStructureFactor as a fit model**
    We include the possibility of polydispersity.

    We use a hexagonal lattice with small hex_a lattice constant and large hex_c to mimic a lamellar structure with
    lattice constant 5.833 nm as found for AgBe with main scattering coming from Ag atoms in a plane (z=0).
    The fit results are not as good as the above AgBe example. The fit can be improved limiting it to Q<7.
    This highlights the importance of the atom distribution in the unit cell in the example above.

    3D structure factor S(q) in powder average of a crystal lattice
    with particle asymmetry, DebyeWaller factor, diffusive scattering and broadening due to domain size.

    The qxyz can be an arbitrary composition of points in reciprocal space.
    Uses latticeStructureFactor. The peak shape is a Voigt function.

    Parameters

        See respective definitions.
    lg : float, default = 1
        Lorenzian/gaussian fraction describes the contributions of gaussian and lorenzian shape in peak shape.
         - lorenzian/gaussian >> 1  lorenzian,
         - lorenzian/gaussian ~  1  central part gaussian, outside lorenzian wings
         - lorenzian/gaussian << 1  gaussian
    asym : float, default=0
        Asymmetry factor in sigmoidal as :math:`2fwhm/(1+e^{asym*(x-center)})`
        For asym=0 the Voigt is symmetric with fwhm. See formel.voigt .

        Root mean square displacement :math:`rmsd=<u^2>^{0.5}` determining the Debye Waller factor.
        Units as domainsize and lattice units.
        Here Debye Waller factor is used as :math:`DW(q)=e^{-q^2 rmsd^2 }`
    beta : float, None, dataArray
        Asymmetry factor of the formfactor or reduction due to polydispersity.
         - None beta=1, No beta assumed (spherical symmetric formfactor, no polydispersity)
         - dataArray explicitly given as dataArray with beta in .Y column.
           Missing values are interpolated.
         - An approximation for polydisperse beta can be found in [1]_ equ.17.
           This can be realized by  beta=js.dA(np.vstack(q,np.exp(-(q*sr*R)**2)))
           with sr as relative standard deviation of gaussian distribution of the size R.
         - See .formfactor for different formfactors which explicit calculation of beta.

    To get the full scattering the formfactor needs to be included (See Notes and Examples).
    1-3 dimensional lattice structures with basis containing multiple atoms (see lattice).
    To orient the crystal lattice use lattice methods .rotatehkl2Vector and .rotateAroundhkl

    Parameters
    ----------
    qxyz : array 3xN
        Wavevector array representing a slice/surface in 3D q-space, 1/nm.
        This can describe a detector plane, section of the Ewald sphere or a line in reciprocal space.
    lattice : lattice object
        Lattice object with arbitrary atoms/particles in the unit cell,
        or predefined lattice from rhombicLattice, bravaisLattice, scLattice,bccLattice,
        fccLattice, diamondLattice, hexLattice, hcpLattice with scattering length of unit cell atoms.
        See lattices for examples.
    rotation : 4x float as [h,k,l,sigma], None
        Rotation of the crystal around axis hkl to get the average of a distribution of orientations.
        Uses a Gaussian distribution of width sigma (units rad) around actual orientation to integrate.

        For 2D lattices the (l) index corresponds to norm vector perpendicular to the plane.

        Rotation is not defined for 1D.

    domainsize : float,list, list of directions
        Domainsize of the crystal, units as lattice constant of lattice.
        According to Debye-Scherrer equation :math:`fwhm=2\pi/domainsize` the peak width is determined [2]_.
         - float        : assume same domainsize in all directions.
         - list 3 float : domainsize in directions of latticeVectors.
         - list 4 x 3   : 3 times domainsize in hkl direction as [[size,h,k,l] ,[..],[..] ]
                         [[3,1,1,1],[100,1,-1,0],[100,1,1,-2]]  is thin in 111 direction and others are thick
                         The user should take care that the directions are nearly orthogonal.
    rmsd : float, default=0.02

    Notes
    -----
    - The scattering intensity of a crystal domain is

      .. math:: I(q)={\Delta\rho}^2 n P(q) S(q)

      with
       - :math:`\Delta\rho` scattering length difference between matrix and particles
       - :math:`n` number density (of elementary cells)
       - :math:`P(q)` form factor
       - :math:`S(q)` structure factor :math:`S(q)`
      For inhomogeneous particles we can incorporate :math:`\Delta\rho(r)` in the formfactor :math:`P(q)`
      if this includes the integrated scattering length differences.
    - The structure factor is [1]_ :

      .. math:: S(q)=1+ \beta(q)(Z_0(q)-1)*DW(Q)

      with
       - :math:`\beta(q)=<F(q)>^2/<F(q)^2>` as asymmetry factor [3]_ dependent on the
         scattering amplitude :math:`F(q)` and particle polydispersity
       -  :math:`DW(q)` Debye Waller factor

    - The  lattice factor is [1]_ :

      .. math :: Z_0(q) = \frac{(2\pi)^3}{mv} \sum\limits_{hkl}f_{hkl}^2L_{hkl}(q,g_{hkl})

      with
       - :math:`g_{hkl}`     peak positions
       - :math:`m`           number of particles per unit cell
       - :math:`f_{hkl}`     unit cell structure factor that takes into account symmetry-related extinction rules
       - :math:`v`         volume of the unit cell
       - :math:`hkl`         reflections

    - Unit cell structure factors :math:`f_{hkl}` are normalised that the lattice factor is normalised for
      infinite q to 1. With i as unit cell atoms at fractional position in the unit cell :math:`[x_i,y_i,z_i]`
      and scattering amplitude :math:`b_i` we get :

      .. math:: f_{hkl}^2 = \big(\sum_i b_i e^{-2\pi (hx_i+ky_i+lz_i)}\big)^2 / \sum_i b_i^2


    - The peak shape function is

      .. math :: L_{hkl}(q,g_{hkl}) = \frac{1}{ \sqrt{2\pi} \sigma} e^{-\frac{(q-g_{hkl})^2}{2\sigma^2}}

      with :math:`\sigma=fwhm/2\sqrt{2log(2)}` related to the domainsize.

      Correspondingly :math:`\sigma` is a vector describing the peak shapes in all directions.

    - Distributions of domain orientation are included by the parameter rotation that describes
      gaussian distributions with mean and sigma around an axis defined by the corresponding hkl indices.

    - DW is a Debye Waller like factor as :math:`DW(q)=e^{-q^2<u^2>}` leading to a reduction
      of scattered intensity and diffusive scattering.
      It has contributions from thermal lattice disorder
      ( DW factor with 1/3 factor in 3D).

    - To get the scattering of a specific particle shape the formfactor has to be included.
      The above is valid for isotropic scatterers (symmetric or uncorrelated to the crystal orientation)
      as only in this case we can separate structure factor and form factor.

    Scattering of a slightly tilted **2D hexagonal plane** showing partly the scattering lines in reciprocal space.
    For 2D planes the Bragg peaks become Bragg lines in reciprocal space that result in elongated scattering patterns
    when intersecting with the scattering plane. Remember to use the real Ewald sphere.
    The missing peaks in the x-plane corner are because of hklmax=11.

def diffuseLamellarStack(q, d, N, dN, kind='caille', dc=0.1):
    r"""
    Bragg peaks and diffuse scattering from lamellar structures.

    Lamellar phases are characterized by scattering patterns containing pseudo-Bragg peaks from the layer ordering.
    Fluctuations of the lamellae cause different kinds of diffuse scattering.
    See [1]_ for details and references.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : array
        Wavevectors in units nm.
    d : float
        Layer spacing (distance between layers) in units nm.
    N : float, int
        Number of layers.
        Actually we use a Poisson distribution with mean N and standard deviation dN.
        For Large N this is similar to a Gaussian distribution and a valid ditribution for small N.
    dN : float
        Standard deviation from mean describing the width of the Poisson distribution.
        dN=0 no distribution.
    kind : 'difffuse', 'para', 'caille'
        Kind of distortions in the layers
         - 'diffuse' : Thermal disorder. [2]_
             Each layer k fluctuates uncorrelated with an amplitude :math:`\Delta = (d_k - d)^2`
             using a common Debye Waller factor. Uncorrelated fluctuations of layers.
         - 'para' : paracrystalline model. [3]_
             Small fluctuations of layer spacing :math:`\Delta` are considered, stacking disorder
             corresponding to a paracrystal of the second kind.
             The position of individual fluctuating layers are determined solely by its nearest neighbours.
         - 'caille' modified Caille. [4]_
            Lamellar stacks, the fluctuations are quantified in terms of the
            flexibility of the membranes dependent on bulk compression modulus B and
            bending rigidity K of the lamellae. For low dN it approximates normal Caille
    dc : float
         Strength of fluctuations.
          - 'para' and 'diffuse'
              Fluctuations of amplitude relative to d. :math:`dc = \Delta/d`  with :math:`\Delta = (d_k - d)^2`.
          - 'caille'
              Caille Parameter in modified Caille model.

              .. math:: dc = \eta = \frac{\pi kT}{2d(BK)^{1/2}}

              with bulk compression modulus B and bending rigidity K of the lamellae.

    Returns
    -------
    dataArray : [q, Sq]

    Notes
    -----
    Multi lamellar structures with disorder. See [1]_

    - thermal disorder

      .. math:: S(Q) = N + 2 exp(-\frac{Q^2\Delta^2}{2}) \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} (N-k) cos(kQd)

    - paracrystalline theory

      .. math:: S(Q) = N + 2 \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} (N-k) cos(kQd) exp(-\frac{k^2Q^2\Delta^2}{2})

    - Modified Caillé Theory

      .. math:: S(Q) = N + 2 \sum_{k=1}^{N-1} (N-k) cos(kQd) \
                             exp(-(\frac{Qd}{2\pi})^2 \eta \gamma) (\pi k)^{-(Qd/2\pi)^2 \eta}

    Distribution of stack sizes (for dN>0):

    .. math:: S(Q) = N + \sum_{N_k=pmf(0.001)}^{N_k=pmf(0.999)} w_k S_k(Q)

    using a Poisson distribution with probabilities :math:`w_k`
    for :math:`N_k` between percent point function (ppf) 0.001..0.999 .

    For reasonable large N the Poisson distribution approximates a Gaussian.
