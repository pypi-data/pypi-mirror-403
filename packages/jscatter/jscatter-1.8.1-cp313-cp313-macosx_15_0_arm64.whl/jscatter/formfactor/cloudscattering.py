r"""
Cloud can represent any object described by a cloud of (different) scatterers with
scattering amplitudes as constant, sphere scattering amplitude,
Gaussian scattering amplitude or explicitly given ones.

The scattering of a cloud can represent the scattering of a **cluster of particles** with polydispersity
and position distortion according to root-mean-square displacements (rms).
Polydispersity and rms displacements are randomly changed within the explicit orientational average to represent
an ensemble average (opposite to the time average of a single cluster).

The cloud can represent a **particle lattice** in a nano particle to describe the Bragg peaks or be used as a kind
of volume integrations for **arbitrary shaped particles**.
Additional complex objects composed of different types of subparticles can be created.
E.g a hollow sphere decorated by Gaussian chains. See `cloudscattering examples` below.

The scattering is calculated by explicit calculation with a spherical average to allow inclusion of
polydispersity, position distortion and because its faster for large numbers of particles (>1000).
For small number of particles the Debye equation can be used but without polydispersity and position distortion.
See :py:func:`~.cloudscattering.cloudScattering`

Note:
    Models that are build by positioning of differently shaped particles might depict
    approximations of the real scattering as overlaps are not considered or
    changes of specific configurations due to the presence of another particle might change.
    As an example we look at  :py:func:`~.formfactor.composed.sphereGaussianCorona`. The Gaussian coils have overlap
    with the inner sphere and for high aggregation numbers the coil overlap is not described correctly.

    Nevertheless, these approximations might be useful to describe general features of a scattering pattern.
    Additionally one might consider that analytic models as e.g. a sphere are approximations itself neglecting
    surface roughness, interfaces, deviations from symmetry or anisotropy and
    break down if a length scale of internal building blocks as e.g. atoms is reached.

Cloudscattering results are normalized by :math:`I_0=(\sum b_i)^2` to equal one for q=0
(except for polydispersity).

def cloudScattering(q, cloud, relError=50, formfactoramp=None, V=None, rms=0, ffpolydispersity=0, ncpu=0):
    r"""
    Orientation averaged scattering of a cloud of isotropic particles.

    Cloud can represent any object/lattice described by a cloud of scatterers with scattering amplitudes
    as constant, sphere scattering amplitude, Gaussian scattering amplitude or explicitly given one.
    The result is normalized by :math:`I_0=(\sum b_i)^2` to equal one for q=0 (except for polydispersity).

    - .I0 represents the forward scattering.
    - Use :math:`b_i=b_vV_{unit cell}` with :math:`b_v` as
      scattering length density in the unit cell to get correct material scattering length density.
    - Remember that the atomic bond length are on the order 0.1-0.2 nm and crystal peaks are expected on this scale.
    - Methods to build clouds of scatterers e.g. a cube decorated with spheres at the corners can be
      found in :ref:`Lattice` with examples.
    - By default explicit spherical average is done. If rms and polydispersity are not needed the Debye-function
      can be used (for particle numbers<1000 it is faster).

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : array, ndim= Nx1
         Radial wavevectors in 1/nm.
    cloud : array Nx3 or Nx4 or Nx5
        - Center positions cloud[:,:3] (in nm) of the N scatterers in the cloud.
        - If given cloud[:,3] is the scattering length :math:`b_i` at positions cloud[:,:3], otherwise :math:`b=1`.
        - If given cloud[:,4] is the column index in formfactor for a specific scatterer.
        - To compare with material scattering length density :math:`b_v` use :math:`b=b_vV_{unit cell}` with
          :math:`b_v` as scattering length density and :math:`V_{unit cell}` as cloud unit cell volume.
    relError : float
        Determines calculation method.

        - relError>1 : Explicit calculation of spherical average with Fibonacci lattice on sphere
          of 2*relError+1 points. Already 150 gives good results (see Examples)
        - 0<relError<1 : Monte Carlo integration on sphere until changes in successive iterations
          become smaller than relError.
          (Monte carlo integration with pseudo random numbers, see sphereAverage).
          This might take long for too small error.
        - relError=0 : The Debye equation is used (no asymmetry factor beta, no rms, no ffpolydispersity).
          Computation is of order :math:`N^2` opposite to above which is order :math:`N`.
          For about 1000 particles same computing time,for 500 Debye is 4 times faster than above.
          If beta, rms or polydispersity is needed above.
    rms : float, default=0
        Root mean square displacement :math:`\langle u^2 \rangle^{0.5}` of the positions in cloud as
        random (Gaussian) displacements in nm.

        - Displacement u is randomly changed for each orientation in orientational average.
        - rms results in a Debye-Waller factor e.g. for crystal lattices and in diffuse scattering at high q.
        - Using a low number of displacements introduces noise on the model function because of bad sampling.
          To reduce this noise during fitting relError should be high (>2000 for linearPearls) and the result might be
          smoothed.
    formfactoramp : None,'gauss','sphere', array
        Normalized scattering amplitudes of cloud points :math:`\hat{F_a^i}(q)`.

        :math:`F_a(q)=b_i \hat{F_a^i}(q)` with  bi from cloud[3].

        - None    : const scattering amplitude.
        - 'sphere': Sphere scattering amplitude according to [3]_ equal for all cloud points.
                    Parameter V is needed to determine :math:`R`.
                    The sphere radius is :math:`R=(\frac{3V}{4\pi})^{1/3}`
        - 'gauss' : Gaussian function  :math:`\hat{F_a}(q) = exp(-\pi V^{2/3}q^2)` according to [2]_
                    Equal for all cloud points. The Gaussian shows no artificial minima compared to the sphere.
                    Use parameter V to determine :math:`b_i`.
        - 'coil' :  Polymer coil (ideal Gaussian chain) showing scattering according to Debye function equal for all.
                    Parameter V needed to determine :math:`R_g = (\frac{3V}{4\pi})^{1/3}`.
                    The scattering length is :math:`b_i = Nb_{monomer}` with monomer number :math:`N`.
        - Explicit isotropic :math:`\hat{F_a}(q)` as array with [q,fa1(q),fa2(q),fa3(q),....].
           - If multiple fai are given the index i for a cloud point needs to be given in cloud[4]
           - The normalized scattering amplitude fa for each cloud point is calculated as fa=fai/fai[0].
             Missing values are linear interpolated, q values outside interval are mapped to qmin or qmax.
           - Explicit formfactors are assumed to be isotropic.
           - If the scattering amplitude is not known :math:`F_a(q) \approx F^{1/2}(q)`
             might be used as crude approximation for low Q.
    V : float, default=None
        Volume of the scatterers to determine scattering amplitude (see formfactoramp).
        Only needed for formfactoramp 'sphere', 'coil' and 'gauss'.
    ffpolydispersity : float
        Polydispersity of the gridpoints in relative units for sphere, gauss, explicit.
        Assuming F(q*R) for each gridpoint F is scaled as F(q*f*R)  with f as normal distribution
        around 1 and standard deviation ffpolydispersity. The scattering length :math:`b` is scaled according
        to the respective volume change by f**3. (f<0 is set to zero) assuming a volume scatterer.
        This results in a change of the forward scattering because of the stronger weight of larger objects.
    ncpu : int, default 0
        Number of cpus used in the pool for multiprocessing.
         - not given or 0 : all cpus are used
         - int>0          : min(ncpu, mp.cpu_count)
         - int<0          : ncpu not to use
         - 1              : single core usage for testing or comparing speed to Debye

    Returns
    -------
    dataArray
        Columns [q, Pq, beta, fa]
         - Pq , formfactor , beta asymmetry factor, fa scattering amplitude
         - .I0 :          :math:`=I(q=0)=(\sum_N b_i)^2`
         - .sumblength :  :math:`=\sum_N b_i`
         - .formfactoramplitude   : formfactor amplitude of cloudpoints according to type for all q values.
         - .formfactoramplitude_q :  corresponding q values

    Notes
    -----
    We calculate the normalized formfactor :math:`\hat{F}(q)` for :math:`N` particles
    in a volume :math:`V` after explicit orientational average :math:`<>`

    .. math:: \hat{F}(q)=< \hat{F_a}(q) \cdot \hat{F_a}^*(q) >=< |\hat{F_a}(q)|^2 >

    with normalized scattering amplitude :math:`\hat{F_a}(q)` and scattering length density :math:`b(r)`
    (:math:`b_i(q)` is the particle formfactor)

    .. math:: \hat{F_a}(q)= \int_V b(r) e^{i\mathbf{qr}} \mathrm{d}r  / \int_V b(r) \mathrm{d}r  =
                    \sum_N b_i(q) e^{i\mathbf{qr}}  / \sum_N b_i(0)

    The scattering intensity of a single object represented by the cloud is

    .. math:: I(q)=\hat{F}(q) \cdot (\int_V b(r) \mathrm{d}r)^2 = \hat{F}(q) \cdot (\sum_i b_i )^2

    beta is the asymmetry factor [1]_ :math:`beta =|< \hat{F_a}(q) >|^2 / < |\hat{F_a}(q)|^2 >`

    One has to expect a peak at :math:`q \approx 2\pi/d_{NN}` with :math:`d_{NN}` as the next
    neighbour distance between particles.

    :math:`b_i(q)` is a particle formfactor amplitude of the particles as e.g. q dependent Xray
    scattering amplitude or the formfactors in a cloud of different particles,
    but may also be constant as for neutron scattering atomic formfactors.

    Random displacements :math:`u_i` lead to :math:`r_i=r_i+u_i` and to the Debye-Waller factor for Bragg peaks
    and diffusive scattering at higher q. See :ref:`A nano cube build of different lattices` .

    The explicit orientational average can be simplified using the **Debye scattering equation** [4]_

     .. math::  \hat{F}(Q)(\sum b_i)^2=\sum_i \sum_j b_i(q) b_j(q) \frac{\sin(qr_{ij})}{qr_{ij}}
                     =\sum_i b_i(q)^2 + 2\sum_i \sum_{j>i} b_i(q) b_j(q) \frac{\sin(qr_{ij})}{qr_{ij}}

    Here no rms or ffpolydispersity are included. The calculation of :math:`beta` requires an additional calculation.

    The scattering of a cloud can represent the scattering of a *cluster of particles* with polydispersity
    and position distortion according to root-mean-square displacements (rms).
    Polydispersity and rms displacements are randomly changed within the orientational average to represent
    an ensemble average (opposite to the time average of a single cluster).

    **Examples**
     - See :py:func:`~.structurefactor.ordered.latticeStructureFactor` for nanocubes.
     - :ref:`A nano cube build of different lattices` .
     - The model :py:func:`~.formfactor.composed.linearPearls` uses cloudscattering.
       Look into the source code as example how to create a complex model.


    Examples
    --------
    The example compares to the analytic solution for an ellipsoid, then for a cube.
    For other shapes the grid may be better rotated away from the object symmetry or a random grid should be used.
    The example shows a good approximation with NN=20. Because of the grid peak at :math:`q=2\pi/d_{NN}`
    the grid scatterer distance :math:`d_{NN}` should be :math:`d_{NN} < \frac{1}{3} 2\pi/q_{max}` .

    Inspecting :ref:`A nano cube build of different lattices` shows other possibilities building a grid.
    Also, a pseudo random grid can be used :py:func:`~.structurefactor.ordered.pseudoRandomLattice` .

    Using cloudScattering as **fit model**.

    We have to define a model that parametrizes the building of the cloud that we get fit parameters.
    As example, we use two overlapping spheres. The model can be used to fit some data.
    The build of the model is important as it describes how the overlap is treated e.g. as average.

    We have to consider some points:
     - It is important that the model is continuous in its parameters to avoid steps as
       any fit algorithm cannot handle this.
     - We have to limit some parameters that make giant grids.
       Fit algorithm make first a small step then a large one to estimate a good step size for parameter changes.
       If in the dumbbell example the radii R1 or R2 is increased to >1000 then the grid size burst the RAM
       and we get a Memory Error. Use hard limits for the radii to a reasonable value as shown below (see setlimit).
     - The argument "diff_step" increases the initial step size as x*diff_step,
       which is in default something like machine epsilon (~1e-8, so just small).
       Change it to 0.01 to jump over local minima and find an improved fit.
     - In the below example the first fit is fast but bad as we find a local minimum.
       ``diff_step=0.01`` imroves this dramatically and is still fast
       A global fit algorithm takes quite long but finds the correct solution.

def orientedCloudScattering(qxzw, cloud, mosaicity=None, formfactoramp=None, rms=0,  V=None,  nCone=50, ncpu=0):
    r"""
    Oriented 3D scattering of a cloud of isotropic particles.

    - Cloud can represent an object/lattice described by a cloud of isotropic scatterers
      to describe formfactors or structure factors.
    - Scattering amplitudes may be constant, sphere scattering amplitude,
      Gaussian scattering amplitude or explicitly given form factor.
    - For mean cloud particle distance *d* one expects Bragg peaks or structure factor peaks around 2π/d.
    - In a scattering geometry with the incoming beam along the cloud z-axis a flat small angle detector
      depicts the projection of the Ewald sphere onto the :math:`q_xq_y`-plane (see sas).
      Only for small angle scattering one might assume z=0.
    - Instead of rotating the cloud by rotation matrix :math:`R` we may rotate the reciprocal space by :math:`R^T`
      to result in a rotating crystal method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    qxzw : array, ndim= Nx3
         3D wavevectors in 1/nm.
         Wavevectors may represent a line, a plane or any other 3D distribution in reciprocal space
         (e.g. Ewald-sphere surface).
         If 2D (ndim=Nx2) the 3rd dim is set to zero.
    cloud : array Nx3, Nx4, Nx5
        Positions (center of mass) and type of particles.

        - cloud[:,3] Center of mass positions (in nm) of the N scatterers in the cloud.
        - cloud[:,3] scattering length :math:`b` at positions cloud[:,:3], optional, otherwise :math:`b=1`.
        - cloud[:,4] column index in formfactoramp for a specific scatterer, optional.
    rms : float, default=0
        Root mean square displacement :math:`\langleu^2\rangle^{0.5} of the positions in cloud as random
        displacements in nm. The displacement is randomly chosen for each orientation (nCone).
        rms can be used to simulate a Debye-Waller factor.
        **nCone>>50 with mosaicity>0 or rms>0 is advised to yield reasonable average and reduced noise** .

    mosaicity : list 3 float, default None
        Mosaicity describes a Gaussian distribution of crystallite orientations around a reference orientation [1]_.
        The mosaicity is commonly equated with the standard deviation of the Gaussian [2]_.
        Here mosaicity = [width, phi, theta] (units rad) with

        - width
          - >0 : Gaussian distribution weight (cut at π) with width=sigma.
          - <0 : equal weight within width.
        - phi as azimuthal angle of reference orientation in spherical coordinates (phi=0, theta=π/2 is x axis)
        - theta as altitude angle of reference  orientation in spherical coordinates (theta=0 is Z axis)

        - 3° around the X-axis [np.deg2rad(3),0,π/2]
        - 5° around the Y-axis [np.deg2rad(5),π/2,π/2]
        - 5° around the Z-axis [np.deg2rad(5),0,0]

        Integration is limited to 2.5*sigma in the Gaussian.
    nCone : int
        Number of points in mosaicity distribution as Fibonacci lattice points.
    formfactoramp : None,'gauss','sphere','cube'
        Normalized scattering amplitudes of cloud points :math:`\hat{F_a^i}(q)`.
        :math:`F_a(q)=b_i \hat{F_a^i}(q)` with  bi from cloud[3].
         - None    : const scattering amplitude.
         - 'sphere': Sphere scattering amplitude according to [3]_ equal for all cloud points.
                     Parameter V is needed to determine :math:`R`.
                     The sphere radius is :math:`R=(\frac{3V}{4\pi})^{1/3}`
         - 'gauss' : Gaussian function  :math:`\hat{F_a}(q) = exp(-\pi V^{2/3}q^2)` according to [2]_
                     Equal for all cloud points. The Gaussian shows no artificial minima compared to the sphere.
                     Use parameter V to determine :math:`b_i`.
         - 'coil' :  Polymer coil (ideal Gaussian chain) showing scattering according to Debye function equal for all.
                     Parameter V needed to determine :math:`R_g = (\frac{3V}{4\pi})^{1/3}`.
                     The scattering length is :math:`b_i = Nb_{monomer}` with monomer number :math:`N`.
         - Explicit isotropic :math:`\hat{F_a}(q)` as array with [q,fa1(q),fa2(q),fa3(q),....].
            - If multiple fai are given the index i for a cloud point needs to be given in cloud[4]
            - The normalized scattering amplitude fa for each cloud point is calculated as fa=fai/fai[0].
              Missing values are linear interpolated, q values outside interval are mapped to qmin or qmax.
            - Explicit formfactoramps are assumed to be isotropic.
            - If the scattering amplitude is not known :math:`F_a(q) \approx F^{1/2}(q)`
              might be used as approximation for low Q.
    V : float, default=None
        Volume of the scatterers to determine scattering amplitude (see formfactoramp).
        Only needed for formfactoramp 'sphere' and 'gauss'.
    ncpu : int, default 0
        Number of cpus used in the pool for multiprocessing.
         - not given or 0 : all cpus are used
         - int>0          : min(ncpu, mp.cpu_count)
         - int<0          : ncpu not to use
         - 1              : single core usage for testing or comparing speed to Debye

    Returns
    -------
    dataArray
        Columns [qx, qz, qw, Pq]
         - The forward scattering is Pq(q=0)= sumblength**2
         - .sumblength : Sum of blength with sumblength**2
         - .formfactoramplitude : formfactoramplitude of cloudpoints according to type for all q values.
         - .formfactoramplitude_q :corresponding q values.

def orientedCloudScattering3Dff(qxzw, cloud, mosaicity=None, formfactoramp=None, rms=0, dorient=0,  nCone=None, ncpu=0):
    r"""
    Oriented 3D scattering of a cloud of non-isotropic particles.

    - Cloud can represent an object/lattice described by a cloud of equal non-isotropic scatterers
      as e.g. as a lattice of oriented cuboids or ellipsoids.
    - Anisotropic formfactor amplitudes are fa_cuboid, fa_ellipsoid, fa_disc or can be calculated using
      *orientedCloudScattering(...)[[0,1,2,4]]* e.g. for sphere twins, triples or any other shape.
    - For mean cloud particle distance *d* one expects Bragg peaks or structure factor peaks around 2π/d.
    - In a scattering geometry with the incoming beam along the cloud z-axis a flat small angle detector
      depicts the projection of the Ewald sphere onto the :math:`q_xq_y`-plane (see sas).
      Only for small angle scattering one might assume z=0.
    - Instead of rotating the cloud by rotation matrix :math:`R` we may rotate the reciprocal space by :math:`R^T`
      to result in a rotating crystal method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    qxzw : array, ndim= Nx3, Nx2
         3D wavevectors (unit 1/nm) may represent a plane (e.g. detector plane)
         or any other 3D distribution in reciprocal space as a line or the surface of the Ewald sphere.

         If 2D the 3rd dim (w) is set to zero for convenience.
    cloud : array Nx3, Nx4, Nx5, Nx6, Nx7
        Positions (center of mass) and orientations of individual particles in the cloud.
        Orientation angles describe the rotation of the non-isotropic scatterer relative to the used 3D formfactoramp
        with `yaw, pitch and roll angle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles#Tait–Bryan_angles>`_ as
        rotations  around (in order) z-y'-x" (intrinsic) or x-y-z axes (extrinsic)
        leading to :math:`R = R_z(\theta) R_y(\phi) R_x(\psi)`.

        - cloud[:,:3] center of mass positions
        - cloud[:,3] scattering length :math:`b_i`
        - cloud[:,4] roll angle Ψ [0..2π] around extrinsic x axis.
        - cloud[:,5] pitch angle φ [0..2π] around extrinsic y axis.
        - cloud[:,6] yaw angle θ [0..π] around extrinsic z axis.
    mosaicity : list 3 float, default None
        Mosaicity describes a Gaussian distribution of crystallite orientations around a reference orientation [1]_.
        The mosaicity is commonly equated with the standard deviation of the Gaussian [2]_.
        Here mosaicity = [width, phi, theta] (units rad) with
          - width
             - >0 : Gaussian distribution weight (cut at π) with width=sigma.
             - <0 : equal weight within width.
          - phi as azimuthal angle of reference orientation in spherical coordinates (phi=0, theta=π/2 is x axis)
          - theta as altitude angle of reference  orientation in spherical coordinates (theta=0 is Z axis)
        - 3° around the X-axis [np.deg2rad(3),0,π/2]
        - 5° around the Y-axis [np.deg2rad(5),π/2,π/2]
        - 5° around the Z-axis [np.deg2rad(5),0,0]
        Integration is limited to 2.5*sigma in the Gaussian.
    rms : float, default=0
        Root mean square displacement :math:`\langleu^2\rangle^{0.5} of the positions in cloud as random
        displacements in nm. The displacement is randomly chosen for each orientation (nCone).
        rms can be used to simulate a Debye-Waller factor.
        **nCone>>50 with mosaicity>0 or rms>0 is advised to yield reasonable average and reduced noise**.
    dorient : float, default=0
        Width of Gaussian distribution (units rad) of roll,pitch and yaw angles in cloud particle orientation.
        **nCone>>50 with mosaicity>0, rms>0 or dorient>0  is advised to yield reasonable average and reduced noise**.
    nCone : int, None, default 50
        Number of points in mosaicity distribution as Fibonacci lattice points.
    formfactoramp :  array 4xN
         - Explicit isotropic formfactor amplitude as array with [qx,qz,qw, fa(qx,qz,qw,)] and q in units 1/nm.
         - formfactoramp fa(q) is normalized fa->fa/fa(0,0,0).
         - Missing values are linear interpolated, q values outside interval are mapped to border values.
         - if shape is (N,4) automatic transpose is used.
    ncpu : int, default 0
        Number of cpus used in the pool for multiprocessing.
         - not given or 0 : all cpus are used
         - int>0          : min(ncpu, mp.cpu_count)
         - int<0          : ncpu not to use
         - 1              : single core usage for testing or comparing speed to Debye

    Returns
    -------
    dataArray
        Columns [qx, qz, qw, Pq]
         - .sumblength : sum of blength with sum(cloud[:,3])
         - The forward scattering is :math:`Sq(q=0)= (\sum b_i)^2 = cloud[:,3].sum()^2`

    Rotating the cubes (22°) changes the pattern as shown on the rightmost.
