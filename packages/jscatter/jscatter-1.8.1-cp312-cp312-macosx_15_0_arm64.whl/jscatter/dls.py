    Inverse Laplace transform known as CONTIN analysis developed by Steven Provencher [1,2,4]_ .
    
    This is a wrapper for the original FORTRAN program from Steven Provencher.
    The CONTIN analysis is developed for heterodisperse, polydisperse, and multimodal systems that cannot
    be resolved with the cumulant method. The resolution for separating two different particle 
    populations is approximately a factor of five or higher and the difference in relative 
    intensities between two different populations should be less than 1:10−5. (from Wikipedia and own experience).
    Iuser[i] and Rxx are defined in the original Fortran code.

    The typical usage for DLS is to fit a relaxation time distribution and recalculate volume and number weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    datalist : dataList or single dataArray
        Correlation data as measured e.g. by DLS.
        Check type parameter dependent on input data g1 or g2!
        Each dataArray is processed.
    timescale : float, default 1e-6
        Timescale factor. CONTIN uses internal units of seconds.
        As typical instruments use microseconds (10e-6 s) the time axis needs to be scaled by this factor.
    tmin,tmax : float,int
        First/last time value to use in fit in same units as above data.
        If tmin/tmax are negative the number of points are dropped at begin/end of input data.
        e.g. min=-5 drops the 5 shortest time points; for max the 5 last points
    Ngrid : int
        Number of grid points between gmin and gmax.
    gmin/gmax : float
        First/last time value in distribution X scale.
        If not given calculated from tmin/tmax according to used kernel.
        Maybee first do without to see the scale derived from tmin/tmax.
    qgmin/qgmax : float
        Only for 'relax'.  Same as gmin,gmax except that gmin=qgmin/q^2.
        Maybee first do without to see the scale derived from tmin/tmax.
    qtmin/qtmax : float
        q^2*t scaled times.
    bgr : float; default 0
        If >0: assume background and fit it.
    typ :  int;  default 0
         - 0:  input is g1 (field correlation)
         - 1:  input is intensity correlation g2 as measured by DLS; g1= sign(g2/R21-1)*abs(g2/R21-1)^0.5
         - -1: input is g2-1, takes only the square root; sign preserved as for 1.
               ALV and Malvern Zetasizer save g2-1

    distribution : string, default='x' for typical DLS ,
        Selects distribution type (Iuser(10)) as {'m':1,'D':2,'L':2,'r':3,'u':4,'x':4,'d':4,'T':4}
        using RUSER(15,16,17,19).

        The kernel  :math:`g_1=l^{R23}*exp(-R21*t*l^{R22})` describes always the field correlation.

         - 'x' intensity weight **relaxation times distribution** l=T -> exp(-t/T)
            - R21=1
            - R22=-1
            - R23=0

            **Typical DLS evaluation is done using 'x'.**
            Most instument software converts the result to radius distribution with intensity, volume or number weight.

         - 'molweight'='mass'  mass weight **molecular weight (mw) distribution** l=mw -> mw*exp(-q**2*R18**t*mw**R22)
            - E.g. polymers with :math:`R_h \propto mw^{\nu}` . See Zimm dynamics.
            - R18 to be set in input: relates diffusion coefficient to mol weight
            - R22 to be set in input: exponent e.g.for polymers IN THETA solvent :math:`D=R18*l^{\nu} with \nu=0.5`)
            - R21 = R20**2*R18=q**2*R18
            - R23=1
            - l=mw and field(0)~ mw for weight fraction (intensity ~ mw**2)

         - 'Diff' intensity weight **diffusion coefficient distribution** with l=D -> exp(-q**2*t*D);
            - R23 =0
            - R22 =1
            - R21 =R20^2=q^2
            - l is therefore Diffusion coefficient D

         - 'Laplace'    Laplace transform  with exp(-t*Gamma)
            - R23=0
            - R22=1
            - sets R16=0 (wavelength) => R20=undefined and R21=1
            - l is therefore relaxation rate with transform exp(-t*l)

         - 'iradius' intensity weight **radius distribution** of spheres satisfying Stokes law
            - with l=rh -> exp(-q**2* [k_B*T*/(0.06*pi*visc*rh)] * t)
            - R21 = q**2 * k_B*T*/(0.06*pi*visc)
            - R22=-1
            - R23=0

         - 'vradius'  volume weight **radius distribution** of spheres satisfying stokes law with
            - l=rh -> rh**3*exp(-q**2* [k_B*T*/(0.06*pi*visc*rh)] * t)
            - R23=3
            - R22=-1
            - R21=k_B*R18*R20^2/(0.06pi*R19)
            - and l=rh is a the hydrodynamic radius
            - weight fraction as field(0) ~ V ~ rh**3 for spheres

           Results in unstable small peaks from noise overinterpretation.
           Run example like  ``js.examples.runExample('example_CONTIN_weights.py')``

         - 'T1' intensity weight **relaxation times distribution** l=T1 -> T1*exp(-t/T1)
            -   for nmr rotational diffusion T1 with R23=-1 R21=1, R22=-1 neglecting T2
            -   intensity ~ number of contributing atoms ~M ~ V ~ Rh**3
            -   rot correlation time tc=(4pi*visc/kT)*Rh**3 -> intensity(0) ~ tc -> R23=1

         - 'user'  general case RUSER(15,16,17,19,21,22,23) all user specified
            - e.g. [R16=0,R23=0,R22=-1,R21=0] is Laplace with Gamma^-1

    RDG :  1,-1, default = -1   
        If 1 use Rayleigh Debye Gans formfactor with wall thickness WALL [cm] of hollow sphere (default WALL =0)
        distribution needs to be the 'radius' distribution.
    l : float , R16 overrides value in dataArray if given
        Overrides wavelength in data and set it to 632 nm
        (except for Laplace and relaxation then l=0 overrides this because no wavelength is used).
    n : float, R15, overrides value in dataArray if given
        Refractive index of solvent, default 1.333.
    a : float, R17, overrides value in dataArray if given
        Scattering angle in degrees , default 90°.
    T : float, R18, overrides value in dataArray if given
        Absolute Temperature in K or factor ; default is 293K
    WALL : float, R24, overrides value in dataArray if given
        Wall thickness  in cm for simulation of hollow spheres.
         - =0 normal sphere as default
         - If WALL<0 -> WALL=0
    v : float, R19, overrides value in dataArray if given
        Viscosity in centipoise; 1cPoise=1e-3 Pa*s
         - If v='d2o' or 'h2o' the viscosity of d2o or h2o at the given Temperature T is used
         - default is h2o at T
    write : any 
        If write is given as keyword argument (write=1) the contin output is writen to a file with '.con' appended.

    Returns
    -------
        dataList : input with best solution added as attributes prepended by 'contin_'
         - .contin_bestFit :              **best fit result**

              The columns can be adressed with underscore as e.g. *.contin_bestFit._hydrodynamicradii*.
              See second example.

              For other than 'x' check .contin_bestFit.columnname for the first three.
              The last 4 are always the same as interpreted as relaxation times of hydrodynamic radii
              and interpreted using a hydrodynamic size for volume and number.

           Weighted ci are normalized that the *sum* over all points is equal 1.
           The corresponding probability is the probability of the interval around the corresponding
           relaxation time or Rh. Remember that because of the log scale the interval change width.

    Notes
    -----
    CONTIN  source and executable can be downloaded from http://s-provencher.com/pages/contin.shtml.

    For using CONTIN and the wrapper you need a working CONTIN executable in your path.
    ::

     # Download the FORTRAN source code from his web page in a browser or
     wget http://s-provencher.com/pub/contin/contin.for.gz
     gunzip contin.for.gz
     # compile with gfortran
     gfortran contin.for -o contin  -fallow-argument-mismatch -std=legacy

     # move to a place in your PATH e.g. $HOME/local/bin
     mv contin $HOME/local/bin/contin

     # check if it is executable, open a new shell
     which contin
     # if not found check if the path is in your PATH variable and set it in .bashrc or .profile
     # if still not found may be its not executable; so make it
     chmod u+x $HOME/local/bin/contin

    If Peaks seem small please integrate them as the peak area determines the contributed intensity (see last example).
    Peak area is strongly dependent on the peak point separation dxi = (x[i]-x[i-1]) in particular on a log scale.
    This weight is in some plots added to the probability as Pi*dxi resulting in equal height.
    See [5]_ for details.
    ::

     ff=result.contin_bestFit
     p1=(10<ff.X) &(ff.X<100) # peak borders 10 and 100
     fp1=trapezoid(ff.Y[p1],ff.X[p1])/trapezoid(ff.Y,ff.X) # fraction of full signal

    **An example dataset with noise**
    In this synthetic example the noise causes a peak width of about 20% (std/mean) as it is
    typically found for monodisperse samples measured short times (e.g. proteins on a Zetasizer in automatic mode).
    This contribution is not caused by polydispersity and always present dependent on noise level.
    Noise level can be reduced using longer measurement times, thus reducing the width.
    In real measurements one needs to test with different measurement times if polydispersity is present
    (thus independent on noise level).

    - D = 0.05 nm²/ns corresponds to a hydrodynamic radius of 4.4 nm and results in a
      relaxation time :math:`\Gamma= 1/(q^2D) \approx 58 \mu s`.
    - The below plots shows the CONTIN result as correlation time distribution
      with mean 58 µs ±12 µs and peak weight 95% in good approximation.
    - The second plot shows the radius distribution for different weights.
      Probabilities are for an interval around a point x value that the sum of all points is normalized.
      (not the integral on the log scale).
    - For real measurements one may cut noisy short times or dust contaminated  long times.

    **Bimodal distribution** and the suppression of larger aggregates in mass and number weight.
    The two particles sizes with a factor of 20 in radius shows same contribution to the scattering.
    For mass or number weight the dependence of the scattering intensity on :math:`R^6`
    compensates the contribution of larger aggregates.

    The area under both intensity weighted peaks is equal as can be shown by integration.

def readZetasizerNano(filename, NANOcoding="cp1257", NANOlocale=None):
    """
    Read ASCII file data exported from Malvern Zetasizer Nano (.csv format).

    Format of Zetasizer is '.csv' with one measurement per line as defined in the export macro.
    First line gives names of columns as header line, so header line in NANO export is necessary.
    Lists as Sizes, Volumes... need to be separated by "sample name" because of different length.
    Only 'Size' lines are read as datalines.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : string
        Zetasizer filename
    NANOcoding : string
        UTF coding from Windows
    NANOlocale : list of string
        | encoding of weekday names in NAno textfile
        | ['de_DE','UTF-8'] NANO set to German
        | ['en_US','UTF-8'] NANO set to US
        | ...

    Returns
    -------
    dataList with dataArray for each measurement
     Dataarray contains :
       - correlation data [CorrelationDelayTime; g1; g2minus1] (if present otherwise empty dataArray)
       - .distributions : Distribution fits with columns
          [RelaxationTimes, Sizes, Intensities, Volumes, Diffusions] (if present)
       - fit results of correlation function in attributes (some channels are discarded -> see Zetasizer settings)
           - .distributionFitDelayTimes timechannels
           - .distributionFitData measured points
           - .distributionFit fit result
       - Check .attr for more attributes like
         SampleName, MeanCountRate, SizePeak1mean, SizePeak1width, Temperature

        If no correlation or distributions are present the data are zero and only parameters are stored.
        No unit conversion is done.

    Zetasizer software saves :math:`g_2-1=g_1^2` which can also be used for fitting
    and may be prefered for fitting.

    CorrelationData.Y contains :math:`g_1 = sign(g_2-1)|g_2-1|^{1/2}))`
    to preserve noise distribution around 0 and not to bias :math:`g_1` to positive values.

    Zeros in data are from original read data file related to the instrument software.

    Notes
    -----
    The template for export in Zetasizer has some requirements:

    - The header line should be included.
    - Separator is the tab.
    - First entries should be "Serial Number" "Type" "Sample Name" "Measurement Date and Time"
    - Sequence data as "Sizes", "Intensities" should be separated by "Sample Name" as separator.
    - Appending to same file is allowed if new header line is included.
