**napari** is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images. It's built on top of Qt (for the GUI), vispy (for performant GPU-based rendering), and the scientific Python stack (numpy, scipy).

We're developing **napari** in the open! You can follow progress on [our project roadmap]([https://github.com/napari/napari](https://github.com/orgs/napari/projects/24)), test out new versions as we release them, and contribute ideas and code.

If you want to refer to our documentation, please go to [napari.org](https://www.napari.org). If you want to contribute to it, please refer to the *contributing* section below. 

We're working on [tutorials](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/), but you can also quickly get started by looking below.

## try it out now!
[Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/#standalone-installer) to try napari.
Then launch the program in a terminal window with the command:
```sh
uvx "napari[all]"
```
In the `File` menu, select `Open Sample` and select a sample image to get started.


## installation
For a full installation, we recommend installing napari into a virtual environment, like this:

```sh
conda create -y -n napari-env -c conda-forge python=3.11
conda activate napari-env
python -m pip install "napari[all]"
```

If you prefer conda over pip, you can replace the last line with: `conda install -c conda-forge napari pyqt`

See here for the full [installation guide](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html).

## simple example

This example uses a data sample from the `scikit-image` library, but you can pass your own dataset as an array to `imshow`.
From inside an IPython shell, you can open up an interactive viewer by calling

```python
from skimage import data
import napari

viewer, layers = napari.imshow(data.cells3d(), channel_axis=1, ndisplay=3)
```

![napari viewer with a multichannel image of cells displayed as two image layers: nuclei and membrane.](./src/napari/resources/multichannel_cells.png)


To use napari from inside a script, use `napari.run()`:

```python
from skimage import data
import napari

viewer, layers = napari.imshow(data.cells3d(), channel_axis=1, ndisplay=3)
napari.run()  # start the "event loop" and show the viewer
```

## features

Check out the scripts in our [`examples` folder](examples) to see some of the functionality we're developing!

**napari** supports six main different layer types, `Image`, `Labels`, `Points`, `Vectors`, `Shapes`, and `Surface`, each corresponding to a different data type, visualization, and interactivity. You can add multiple layers of different types into the viewer and then start working with them, adjusting their properties.

All our layer types support n-dimensional data and the viewer provides the ability to quickly browse and visualize either 2D or 3D slices of the data.

**napari** also supports bidirectional communication between the viewer and the Python kernel, which is especially useful when launching from jupyter notebooks or when using our built-in console. Using the console allows you to interactively load and save data from the viewer and control all the features of the viewer programmatically.

You can extend **napari** using custom shortcuts, key bindings, and mouse functions.

## tutorials

For more details on how to use `napari` checkout our [tutorials](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/). These are still a work in progress, but we'll be updating them regularly.

## mission, values, and roadmap

For more information about our plans for `napari` you can read our [mission and values statement](https://napari.org/stable/community/mission_and_values.html), which includes more details on our vision for supporting a plugin ecosystem around napari.
You can see details of [the project roadmap here](https://napari.org/stable/roadmaps/index.html).

## contributing

Contributions are encouraged! Please read our [contributing guide](https://napari.org/dev/developers/contributing/index.html) to get started. Given that we're in an early stage, you may want to reach out on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues) before jumping in. 

If you want to contribute to or edit our documentation, please go to [napari/docs](https://github.com/napari/docs).

Visit our [project weather report dashboard](https://napari.org/weather-report/) to see metrics and how development is progressing.

## code of conduct

`napari` has a [Code of Conduct](https://napari.org/stable/community/code_of_conduct.html) that should be honored by everyone who participates in the `napari` community.

## governance

You can learn more about how the `napari` project is organized and managed from our [governance model](https://napari.org/stable/community/governance.html), which includes information about, and ways to contact the [@napari/steering-council and @napari/core-devs](https://napari.org/stable/community/team.html#current-core-developers).
