# WordReplaceEngine

WordReplaceEngine is a library for quickly replacing text in `word`. Developers only need to write the replacement logic in their program, and subsequent changes to the Word format do not require modifications to the program itself.

Language:

- [English](README.md)

- [Traditional Chinese](README.zh-TW.md)

# Usage Instructions
(1a) If you are referencing directly from GitHub, please enter the following in `pip`:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/orztrickster/WordReplaceEngine.git
```
(1b) If you are referencing from PyPI, please enter the following in `pip`:
```
pip install WordReplaceEngine
```
(2) Next, define the following at the beginning of the program:
```
from WordReplaceEngine import Document
```
(3) Create an object:
```
document = Document()
```
(4) Enter the `word` file to be modified. You can pre-enter the paths of all possible `word` files and specify the name when you need to modify them later. Here, we will arbitrarily name them `word_001` to `word_004`. Please modify them according to your actual needs:
```
document.set_word_version_path("word_001", "C:/WordReplaceEngine/word_001.docx")
document.set_word_version_path("word_002", "C:/WordReplaceEngine/word_002.docx")
document.set_word_version_path("word_003", "C:/WordReplaceEngine/word_003.docx")
document.set_word_version_path("word_004", "C:/WordReplaceEngine/word_004.docx")
```
(5) Specify the name of the `word` file to be modified next, where `save_path` represents the storage path
```
document.run_version("word_001", save_path = "C:/WordReplaceEngine/")
```
(6a) Next, specify the corresponding string to be replaced in the `word` file. Here, replace `$$$WordReplaceEngine_001$$$` in the `word` file with `Hello World`
```
document.set("$$$WordReplaceEngine_001$$$", "Hello World")
```
(6b) You can also specify the text size and position
```
from docx.shared import Pt
from docx.enum.text import WD_PARAGRAPH_ALIGNMENT
document.set("$$$WordReplaceEngine_002$$$", "Hello WordReplaceEngine!", new_alignment = WD_PARAGRAPH_ALIGNMENT.LEFT, new_font_size = Pt(20))
```
(6c) You can also specify whether the text is bold, the font of Chinese or English, and the color
```
document.set("$$$WordReplaceEngine_003$$$", "Hello WordReplaceEngine!!!", bold = True, new_font_name = "Microsoft JhengHei", new_font_name_Chinese = "Microsoft JhengHei", font_color=(192, 0, 0))
```
(7) After all the information has been entered, please execute `execute_set` to apply the settings
```
document.execute_set()
```
(8) Next, enter `output` to output the file. The output file will be located in `C:/WordReplaceEngine/` as specified in the example above
```
document.output("WordReplaceEngine", pdf = False, docx = True)
```
(9) Finally, please enter `delete` to clear the settings you just applied, and then you can return to step (5) to repeat the modification of other files.
```
document.delete()
```
