This function parses the spec, creates UI components for each endpoint and parameter, and lets you interact with the API directly from your browser.\n\nHere's a minimal example:\n\n```python\nimport gradio as gr\n\ndemo = gr.load_openapi(\n    openapi_spec=\"https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json\",\n    base_url=\"https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3\",\n    paths=[\"/pet.*\"],\n    methods=[\"get\", \"post\"],\n)\n\ndemo.launch()\n```\n\n**Parameters:**\n- **openapi_spec**: URL, file path, or Python dictionary containing the OpenAPI v3 spec (JSON format only).\n- **base_url**: The base URL for the API endpoints (e.g., `https://api.example.com/v1`).\n- **paths** (optional): List of endpoint path patterns (supports regex) to include. If not set, all paths are included.\n- **methods** (optional): List of HTTP methods (e.g., `[\"get\", \"post\"]`) to include. If not set, all methods are included.\n\nThe generated app will display a sidebar with available endpoints and create interactive forms for each operation, letting you make API calls and view responses in real time.\n\n## Next steps\n\nOnce your Gradio app is running, you can share the URL with others so they can try out the API through a friendly web interface\u2014no code required. For even more power, you can launch the app as an MCP (Model Control Protocol) server using [Gradio's MCP integration](https://www.gradio.app/guides/building-mcp-server-with-gradio), enabling programmatic access and orchestration of your API via the MCP ecosystem. This makes it easy to build, share, and automate API workflows with minimal effort.\n\n", "tags": ["OPENAPI", "SPEC"], "spaces": [], "url": "/guides/from-openapi-spec/", "contributor": null}}
