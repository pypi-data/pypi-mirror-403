# searchandsort

A lightweight Python package that provides commonly used **searching and sorting algorithms**
with optional **execution time analysis**.

This package is designed for:
- Learning algorithms
- Comparing performance
- Reusing clean implementations in projects

## Features

### Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search (with automatic sorting)

### Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Counting Sort
- Radix Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Shell Sort
- Tim Sort (Python built-in)

Each algorithm is implemented as a **clean, reusable function**.
Optional `*_print` variants display execution time.
