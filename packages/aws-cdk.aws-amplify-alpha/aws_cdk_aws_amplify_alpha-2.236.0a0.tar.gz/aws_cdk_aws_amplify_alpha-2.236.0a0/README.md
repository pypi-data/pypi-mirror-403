The AWS Amplify Console provides a Git-based workflow for deploying and hosting fullstack serverless web applications. A fullstack serverless app consists of a backend built with cloud resources such as GraphQL or REST APIs, file and data storage, and a frontend built with single page application frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, or Gatsby.

## Setting up an app with branches, custom rules and a domain

To set up an Amplify Console app, define an `App`:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_codebuild as codebuild


amplify_app = amplify.App(self, "MyApp",
    source_code_provider=amplify.GitHubSourceCodeProvider(
        owner="<user>",
        repository="<repo>",
        oauth_token=SecretValue.secrets_manager("my-github-token")
    ),
    build_spec=codebuild.BuildSpec.from_object_to_yaml({
        # Alternatively add a `amplify.yml` to the repo
        "version": "1.0",
        "frontend": {
            "phases": {
                "pre_build": {
                    "commands": ["yarn"
                    ]
                },
                "build": {
                    "commands": ["yarn build"
                    ]
                }
            },
            "artifacts": {
                "base_directory": "public",
                "files": -"**/*"
            }
        }
    })
)
```

To connect your `App` to GitLab, use the `GitLabSourceCodeProvider`:

```python
amplify_app = amplify.App(self, "MyApp",
    source_code_provider=amplify.GitLabSourceCodeProvider(
        owner="<user>",
        repository="<repo>",
        oauth_token=SecretValue.secrets_manager("my-gitlab-token")
    )
)
```

To connect your `App` to CodeCommit, use the `CodeCommitSourceCodeProvider`:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_codecommit as codecommit


repository = codecommit.Repository(self, "Repo",
    repository_name="my-repo"
)

amplify_app = amplify.App(self, "App",
    source_code_provider=amplify.CodeCommitSourceCodeProvider(repository=repository)
)
```

The IAM role associated with the `App` will automatically be granted the permission
to pull the CodeCommit repository.

Add branches:

```python
# amplify_app: amplify.App


main = amplify_app.add_branch("main") # `id` will be used as repo branch name
dev = amplify_app.add_branch("dev",
    performance_mode=True
)
dev.add_environment("STAGE", "dev")
```

Auto build and pull request preview are enabled by default.

Add custom rules for redirection:

```python
from aws_cdk.aws_amplify_alpha import CustomRule

# amplify_app: amplify.App

amplify_app.add_custom_rule(CustomRule(
    source="/docs/specific-filename.html",
    target="/documents/different-filename.html",
    status=amplify.RedirectStatus.TEMPORARY_REDIRECT
))
```

When working with a single page application (SPA), use the
`CustomRule.SINGLE_PAGE_APPLICATION_REDIRECT` to set up a 200
rewrite for all files to `index.html` except for the following
file extensions: css, gif, ico, jpg, js, png, txt, svg, woff,
ttf, map, json, webmanifest.

```python
# my_single_page_app: amplify.App


my_single_page_app.add_custom_rule(amplify.CustomRule.SINGLE_PAGE_APPLICATION_REDIRECT)
```

Add a domain and map sub domains to branches:

```python
# amplify_app: amplify.App
# main: amplify.Branch
# dev: amplify.Branch


domain = amplify_app.add_domain("example.com",
    enable_auto_subdomain=True,  # in case subdomains should be auto registered for branches
    auto_subdomain_creation_patterns=["*", "pr*"]
)
domain.map_root(main) # map main branch to domain root
domain.map_sub_domain(main, "www")
domain.map_sub_domain(dev)
```

To specify a custom certificate for your custom domain use the `customCertificate` property:

```python
# custom_certificate: acm.Certificate
# amplify_app: amplify.App


domain = amplify_app.add_domain("example.com",
    custom_certificate=custom_certificate
)
```

## Restricting access

Password protect the app with basic auth by specifying the `basicAuth` prop.

Use `BasicAuth.fromCredentials` when referencing an existing secret:

```python
amplify_app = amplify.App(self, "MyApp",
    source_code_provider=amplify.GitHubSourceCodeProvider(
        owner="<user>",
        repository="<repo>",
        oauth_token=SecretValue.secrets_manager("my-github-token")
    ),
    basic_auth=amplify.BasicAuth.from_credentials("username", SecretValue.secrets_manager("my-github-token"))
)
```

Use `BasicAuth.fromGeneratedPassword` to generate a password in Secrets Manager:

```python
amplify_app = amplify.App(self, "MyApp",
    source_code_provider=amplify.GitHubSourceCodeProvider(
        owner="<user>",
        repository="<repo>",
        oauth_token=SecretValue.secrets_manager("my-github-token")
    ),
    basic_auth=amplify.BasicAuth.from_generated_password("username")
)
```

Basic auth can be added to specific branches:

```python
# amplify_app: amplify.App

amplify_app.add_branch("feature/next",
    basic_auth=amplify.BasicAuth.from_generated_password("username")
)
```

## Automatically creating and deleting branches

Use the `autoBranchCreation` and `autoBranchDeletion` props to control creation/deletion
of branches:

```python
amplify_app = amplify.App(self, "MyApp",
    source_code_provider=amplify.GitHubSourceCodeProvider(
        owner="<user>",
        repository="<repo>",
        oauth_token=SecretValue.secrets_manager("my-github-token")
    ),
    auto_branch_creation=amplify.AutoBranchCreation( # Automatically connect branches that match a pattern set
        patterns=["feature/*", "test/*"]),
    auto_branch_deletion=True
)
```

## Adding custom response headers

Use the `customResponseHeaders` prop to configure custom response headers for an Amplify app:

```python
amplify_app = amplify.App(self, "App",
    source_code_provider=amplify.GitHubSourceCodeProvider(
        owner="<user>",
        repository="<repo>",
        oauth_token=SecretValue.secrets_manager("my-github-token")
    ),
    custom_response_headers=[amplify.CustomResponseHeader(
        pattern="*.json",
        headers={
            "custom-header-name-1": "custom-header-value-1",
            "custom-header-name-2": "custom-header-value-2"
        }
    ), amplify.CustomResponseHeader(
        pattern="/path/*",
        headers={
            "custom-header-name-1": "custom-header-value-2"
        }
    )
    ]
)
```

If the app uses a monorepo structure, define which appRoot from the build spec the custom response headers should apply to by using the `appRoot` property:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_codebuild as codebuild


amplify_app = amplify.App(self, "App",
    source_code_provider=amplify.GitHubSourceCodeProvider(
        owner="<user>",
        repository="<repo>",
        oauth_token=SecretValue.secrets_manager("my-github-token")
    ),
    build_spec=codebuild.BuildSpec.from_object_to_yaml({
        "version": "1.0",
        "applications": [{
            "app_root": "frontend",
            "frontend": {
                "phases": {
                    "pre_build": {
                        "commands": ["npm install"]
                    },
                    "build": {
                        "commands": ["npm run build"]
                    }
                }
            }
        }, {
            "app_root": "backend",
            "backend": {
                "phases": {
                    "pre_build": {
                        "commands": ["npm install"]
                    },
                    "build": {
                        "commands": ["npm run build"]
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        ]
    }),
    custom_response_headers=[amplify.CustomResponseHeader(
        app_root="frontend",
        pattern="*.json",
        headers={
            "custom-header-name-1": "custom-header-value-1",
            "custom-header-name-2": "custom-header-value-2"
        }
    ), amplify.CustomResponseHeader(
        app_root="backend",
        pattern="/path/*",
        headers={
            "custom-header-name-1": "custom-header-value-2"
        }
    )
    ]
)
```

## Configure server side rendering when hosting app

Setting the `platform` field on the Amplify `App` construct can be used to control whether the app will host only static assets or server side rendered assets in addition to static. By default, the value is set to `WEB` (static only), however, server side rendering can be turned on by setting to `WEB_COMPUTE` as follows:

```python
amplify_app = amplify.App(self, "MyApp",
    platform=amplify.Platform.WEB_COMPUTE
)
```

## Compute role

This integration, enables you to assign an IAM role to the Amplify SSR Compute service to allow your server-side rendered (SSR) application to securely access specific AWS resources based on the role's permissions.

For example, you can allow your app's SSR compute functions to securely access other AWS services or resources, such as Amazon Bedrock or an Amazon S3 bucket, based on the permissions defined in the assigned IAM role.

For more information, see [Adding an SSR Compute role to allow access to AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/amplify-SSR-compute-role.html).

By default, a new role is created when `platform` is `Platform.WEB_COMPUTE` or `Platform.WEB_DYNAMIC`.
If you want to assign an IAM role to the APP, set `compute` to the role:

```python
# compute_role: iam.Role


amplify_app = amplify.App(self, "MyApp",
    platform=amplify.Platform.WEB_COMPUTE,
    compute_role=compute_role
)
```

It is also possible to override the compute role for a specific branch by setting `computeRole` in `Branch`:

```python
# compute_role: iam.Role
# amplify_app: amplify.App


branch = amplify_app.add_branch("dev", compute_role=compute_role)
```

## Cache Config

Amplify uses Amazon CloudFront to manage the caching configuration for your hosted applications. A cache configuration is applied to each app to optimize for the best performance.

Setting the `cacheConfigType` field on the Amplify `App` construct can be used to control cache configuration. By default, the value is set to `AMPLIFY_MANAGED`. If you want to exclude all cookies from the cache key, set `AMPLIFY_MANAGED_NO_COOKIES`.

For more information, see [Managing the cache configuration for an app](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/caching.html).

```python
amplify_app = amplify.App(self, "MyApp",
    cache_config_type=amplify.CacheConfigType.AMPLIFY_MANAGED_NO_COOKIES
)
```

## Build Compute Type

You can specify the build compute type by setting the `buildComputeType` property.

For more information, see [Configuring the build instance for an Amplify application](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-build-instance.html).

```python
amplify_app = amplify.App(self, "MyApp",
    build_compute_type=amplify.BuildComputeType.LARGE_16GB
)
```

## Deploying Assets

`sourceCodeProvider` is optional; when this is not specified the Amplify app can be deployed to using `.zip` packages. The `asset` property can be used to deploy S3 assets to Amplify as part of the CDK:

```python
import aws_cdk.aws_s3_assets as assets

# asset: assets.Asset
# amplify_app: amplify.App

branch = amplify_app.add_branch("dev", asset=asset)
```

## Skew protection for Amplify Deployments

Deployment skew protection is available to Amplify applications to eliminate version skew issues between client and servers in web applications.
When you apply skew protection to an Amplify application, you can ensure that your clients always interact with the correct version of server-side assets, regardless of when a deployment occurs.

For more information, see [Skew protection for Amplify deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/skew-protection.html).

To enable skew protection, set the `skewProtection` property to `true`:

```python
# amplify_app: amplify.App

branch = amplify_app.add_branch("dev", skew_protection=True)
```
