# biz.dfch.AsdSte100Parser

This library implements a:
  * An EBNF grammar for Lark (earley) 
  * A multi-pass transformer
  * A tokenizer
  * A serializer.

You must use a special structure of **Markdown** as the input text.

## Installation

[biz-dfch-ste100parser](https://pypi.org/project/biz-dfch-ste100parser) is on [PyPI](https://pypi.org). Create a virtual environment and install the library with `pip`:

```
pip install biz-dfch-ste100parser
```

## Usage

```py
from biz.dfch.ste100parser import ContainerTransformer
from biz.dfch.ste100parser import GrammarType
from biz.dfch.ste100parser import Parser
from biz.dfch.ste100parser import Token

value = ""  # Specify text (example content and output see below).

parser = Parser(GrammarType.CONTAINER)
assert parser.is_valid(value)

# This parses the tree according to the CONTAINER grammar.
initial_tree = parser.invoke(value)

# This transforms the tree to the tokens described in the "Format" section.
transformer = ContainerTransformer()
transformed_tree = transformer.invoke(initial_tree)

# This prints the resulting AST.
print(transformed.pretty())
```

### Input text

```
# This is a heading *level 1*

This is the start of the _first_ paragraph. This is the second sentence.
Third sentence, after a LINEBREAK. The fourth sentence starts a list:
  1 This is the first list item.
  2 Another item
  3 Last item.
The paragraph continues.

This is para2. And, this is a new paragraph with only a single sentence.

## This is our procedure

1. Do this
2. Do that:
   a This is a list with item 1
   b The next item
   c The last item.
3. And then, do this one last time.

This is para3. Here, we have another paragraph.

This is para4. Here, we have another paragraph.
This continues para4 after a LINEBREAK.

This is para5. Here, we have another paragraph.
    a This is a list with item 1
    b The next item
    c The last item.

1. Another proc (without heading)
2. Last step.

> Line1. This-is-some-cite-text-1.1. This-is-some-cite-text-2.1.
> Line2. This-is-some-cite-text-2.1. This-is-some-cite-text-2.2.

And yet another, paragraph.

> LineA. This-is-some-cite-text-A.1. This-is-some-cite-text-A.1.
> LineB. This-is-some-cite-text-B.1. This-is-some-cite-text-B.2.

# Format

  * There a top-level tokens. These are tokens, that must be at the top-most hierarchical level of the text.
  * There are tokens, that can only appear inside other tokens.
  * A text must end with two `NEWLINE` tokens.

## Whitespace (WS)

  * Whitespace is a sequence of either `\t` or ` ` tokens.
  * `\t` is the same as eight ` ` tokens.

```
This is TEXT with whitespace.

This is  TEXT   with    multiple     whitespace.

And\tthis\tis\talso\ttext\twith\twhitespace.
```

## Single space (SPACE)

  * A `SPACE` is a delimiter token that only is inside other `tokens.
  * For example, in `1) Text` the `SPACE` is the delimiter after `1)`. 

```
1) A work step.
```

## NEWLINE

  * A `NEWLINE` is a top-level token.
  * This is a `\r\n` or `\n`.

## TEXT

Any character sequence, that does not contain these characters: `^"'*_`()\s` (regex).

## APOSTROPHE

  * An `APOSTROPHE` is either `'s` or `'` when it comes directly after `TEXT`.
  * You must not put an `APOSTROPHE` in a `squote`.

## Heading

  * A `heading` is a top-level token.
  * A `NEWLINE` that starts with a `# ` (or a multiple of `#`) with one or more `TEXT` tokens.
  * Two `NEWLINE` tokens stop a `heading`.

```
# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

### Heading level 3

#### Heading level 4

##### Heading level 5

```
## Paragraph

  * A `paragraph` is a top-level token.
  * A `paragraph` starts after a `NEWLINE`, when `TEXT` directly comes after the `NEWLINE` token.
  * Two `NEWLINE` tokens stop a `paragraph`. 
  * A `paragraph` can have a `NEWLINE` token between `TEXT` tokens.

```
This is a paragraph. This is still the paragraph.

This is another paragraph. This is still the second paragraph.
This is still the second paragraph (after a LINEBREAK).

This is a new and the last paragraph.

```

## Procedure (list of work steps)

  * A `procedure` is a top-level token.
  * A `procedure` is one or more *work step* (`proc_item`).
  * A `procedure` starts after a `NEWLINE` token, when `[a-zA-Z0-9]+` (`proc_marker`) and `[.)] ` (`PROC_DELIMITER`) directly come after the `NEWLINE` token.
  * A `proc_item` can contain a vertical list.
  * A `proc_item` can contain a `NOTE` or a safety instruction (`WARNING`, `CAUTION`).
  * In contrast to other markdown, there is no two `NEWLINE` to stop the vertical list, `NOTE` or safety instruction. There is only a single `NEWLINE` to stop one of these.

```
1. This is the first work step.
2. This is the second work step.
  * This is a list item in a work step.
  * Another list item in a work step.
3. This is the third work step.
NOTE: This is a note for the work step.
4. This is the fourth work step.
WARNING: This is a safety instruction for this work step of the type 'WARNING'.
4. This is the fifth work step.
CAUTION: This is a safety instruction for this work step of the type 'CAUTION'.
5. A work step can contain multiple:
  * 'NOTE'
  * 'WARNING'
  * 'CAUTION'.
NOTE: This is a note for the work step.
WARNING: This is a safety instruction for this work step of the type 'WARNING'.
CAUTION: This is a safety instruction for this work step of the type 'CAUTION'.
6. This is the last work step.

```

## Vertical list (`list_item`)

  * A vertical list can occur in a `paragraph` or a procedure (`proc_item`).
  * A vertical list is one or more `lite_item`.
  * A `NEWLINE` starts a `list_item` when `WS+`, a `list_marker` and a `SPACE` come directly after the `NEWLINE` token.
  * Before the `list_item`, there is `TEXT` that has a `:` as the last token.
  * A numeric `list_marker` cannot contain a `.` or `)`. This is only correct for `proc_item`.
  * A `list_marker` has `WS` (indentation).
  * You must not put a vertical list inside another vertical list.

```
This is a paragraph, that starts a list:
  * Indented list item with "*" as the list marker
  * Another list item.

This is another paragraph, that starts a list:
    * More indented list item with "*" as the list marker
    * Another list item.

This is a paragraph, that starts a list:
  1 Indented list item with a numeric as the list marker
  2 Another list item.

This is a paragraph, that starts a list:
  a Indented list item with a lower alpha as the list marker
  a Another list item.

This is a paragraph, that starts a list:
  A Indented list item with an upper alpha as the list marker
  B Another list item.
```

## Parentheses (`paren`)

  * This container can 
  * A `paragraph` can contain `paren`.
  * A `list_item` can contain `paren`.
  * A `proc_item` can contain `paren`.
  * A `cite` can contain `paren`.

# Examples:

You find examples in [./test/test_data/](./test/test_data/).

## Heading with paragraph

```
# This is a heading level 1

This is the start of a paragraph. And this is the end of the paragraph.

This is a new paragraph. A paragraph continues after a single NEWLINE.
This is still the same paragraph.
```

## Paragraph with vertical lists

```
# This is a heading level 1

This is the start of a paragraph. This will start a new vertical list:
  * Note, that the list delimiter '*' is indented by a minimum of one `WS`.
  * The next list item.
This continues the paragraph. This is not standard 'Github'-flavored Markdown.

This is a new paragraph. This will start a new vertical list:
  - This is another list delimiter.
  - Another list item.

This is a new paragraph. This will start a new vertical list:
 1 This is another list delimiter.
 2 Another list item.

This is another paragraph.

```

## Paragraph with formatters, quotes and cite

```
# This is a heading level 1

## Text in quotes

This is a paragraph. In *this* paragraph we have "text in double quotes".

> Here is a citation. This is similar to a full line in "double quotes".

This is another paragraph. In _that_ paragraph we have 'text in single quotes'.

At last, this is another paragraph. In *_that_* paragraph we have "text in 'double' quotes" that contains "'single' quotes".
