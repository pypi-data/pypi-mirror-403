    The function starts a SnapLogic task using the API described here:
    https://docs-snaplogic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/993296417/Running+a+Triggered+Task

    In order to start a snaplogic pipeline using a triggered task with a GET request without
    waiting for the pipeline to finish, you have to add an API response using two snaps that return:
        {
        "status":
        200
        "ruuid":
        "<the ruuid of the task run>"
        }
    The relevant snaps can be found in one of the SnapLogic pipelines that currently use airflow.

    Parameters:
        url (string):           The url of the task to be started
        bearer_token (string):  The bearer_token of the Snaplogic task
        params (dict):          The pipeline parameters to send to the SnapLogic task
        timeout (int):          Timeout in seconds for the HTTP request (default: 60)

    Returns:
        ruuid (string):         The id of the task run

    The function retrieves the state of a SnapLogic task.
    The states of a SnapLogic task can be one of the following:
    Queued:     Pipeline is queued for processing, all Pipelines start in this state.
    NoUpdate:   Intermediate state at startup.
    Prepared:   Pipeline has been prepared.
    Started:    Pipeline has started execution.
    Completed:  Pipeline has completed successfully.
    Failing:    Pipeline execution encountered an error and is waiting for Snaps to complete execution before moving to the Failed state.
    Failed:     Pipeline failed.
    Stopped:    Pipeline was stopped, by user or by the system, indicated by the "stopper" key.
    Stopping:   Pipeline is stopping.
    Suspending: Resumable Pipeline has encountered an error and is storing its state.
    Suspended:  Resumable Pipeline has encountered an error and is suspended.
    Resuming:   Resumable Pipeline is loading its state and will soon resume execution where it left off.

    The API is decribed here: https://docs-snaplogic.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SD/pages/2432598066/Retrieve+Info+About+a+Task
