# fabrictestbed-extensions

[![pypi-badge]][pypy] [![api-docs-badge]][api-docs]

This is the implementation of a Python library, otherwise known as
"FABlib", for interacting with [FABRIC][fabric] testbed.

Your first encounter with FABlib might be through FABRIC project's
[JupyterHub instance][fabric-jupyter], where FABlib is pre-installed
for you. You will be presented with many examples of interacting with
FABRIC testbed and FABlib usage when you log in there. Those [notebook
sources][fabric-jupyter-examples] can be found on GitHub as well.

If you want to interact with FABRIC from Jupyter or a Python project
on your local development environment, that is possible too.  See
[Install the FABRIC Python API][fablib-install] and the notes below
for details.

FABlib API docs can be found [here][fablib-api-rtd].  If you have
questions about FABRIC or FABlib usage, please ask them in FABRIC
[forums].

## Installing FABlib

You can install released versions of FABlib from PyPI:

```console
$ pip install fabrictestbed-extensions
```

If you need the current development version of FABlib, install it from
the git repository:

```console
$ pip install git+https://github.com/fabric-testbed/fabrictestbed-extensions@main
```

Note that installing FABlib using either methods will also install a
number of dependencies, so you might want to install FABlib in a
virtual environment. Your favorite tool for managing virtual
environments ([venv], [virtualenv], or [virtualenvwrapper]) should
work. FABRIC team tends to favor virtualenvwrapper.

**NOTE:** This package has been tested and verified to work with Python versions 3.9 through 3.13.

## Using FABlib

Once installed, you can use FABlib in your Python projects:

```python
from fabrictestbed_extensions.fablib.fablib import FablibManager as fablib_manager

try:
    fablib = fablib_manager()
    fablib.show_config()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Exception: {e}")
```

Please note that some [configuration] is required for this to work.

## Contributing to FABlib

We welcome contributions in the form of bug reports, feature requests,
code patches, documentation updates, etc.  If you have ideas that can
help FABlib, please review the [guidelines] first.
