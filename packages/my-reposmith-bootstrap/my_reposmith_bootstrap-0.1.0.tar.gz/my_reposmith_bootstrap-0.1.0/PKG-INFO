# my-reposmith-bootstrap

Bootstrap runner package for **RepoSmith**.

This project provides a **governed installer** for the RepoSmith toolchain.
It is intentionally lightweight and does **not** expose RepoSmith as Python
dependencies. Instead, it installs locked versions explicitly at runtime.

> This is a **runner package**, not a framework or library.

---

## What this package does

When executed, `my-reposmith-bootstrap` will:

- Install **reposmith-core** (locked version)
- Install **reposmith-extensions** (locked version)
- Install **reposmith-cli** (locked version, without dependency resolution)
- Use explicit package indexes (Forgejo + PyPI)
- Avoid modifying global `pip` configuration

All decisions about versions and order are enforced by the bootstrap itself.

---

## Install

```bash
pip install -U my-reposmith-bootstrap
```

---

## Setup RepoSmith

After installation, run:

```bash
my-reposmith-setup
```

Once completed, RepoSmith will be available:

```bash
reposmith --help
reposmith version
```

---

## Governed installation model

This package intentionally:

- ❌ Does **not** list `reposmith-*` packages in `dependencies`
- ❌ Does **not** rely on `pip` dependency resolution
- ❌ Does **not** modify global `pip config`
- ✅ Pins exact versions internally
- ✅ Uses explicit `--index-url` and `--extra-index-url`
- ✅ Acts as a single authoritative installation contract

This ensures:
- Reproducible installs
- No hidden upgrades
- No accidental dependency drift

---

## Package indexes

The bootstrap installs packages from:

- **Primary**: RepoSmith Forgejo PyPI  
- **Fallback**: Public PyPI

Indexes are passed explicitly per install command and are never persisted.

---

## Supported platforms

- Windows (PowerShell)
- Linux
- macOS

> On Windows, restart the shell if the `reposmith` command is not found
> immediately after running the bootstrap.

---

## What this package is NOT

- ❌ Not a RepoSmith SDK
- ❌ Not a library to import
- ❌ Not a dependency manager
- ❌ Not a virtual environment manager

Its only responsibility is **bootstrapping RepoSmith correctly**.

---

## Versioning

This package follows semantic versioning:

- Patch: internal bootstrap fixes
- Minor: controlled upgrade of locked RepoSmith versions
- Major: change in bootstrap contract
